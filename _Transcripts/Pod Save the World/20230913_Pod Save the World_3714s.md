# Could China's Economic Struggles Result in The Invasion of Taiwan?
**Pod Save the World:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, you're in London. Did you happen to catch the Jets game last night? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=0.0s)]
*  Mercifully, I went to bed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  very excited to wake up and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=10.74s)]
*  see [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=13.22s)]
*  What had happened with the Aaron Rodgers era? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=14.96s)]
*  The first thing I walked to was our text chain with like Cody Keenan being like, oh man Rhodes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=18.88s)]
*  I hope you didn't see that or something like that. I was like, oh no, what happened? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=24.72s)]
*  And then of course I saw that two plays and he tore his Achilles [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=28.88s)]
*  Yeah for those who don't watch the NFL Ben's beloved New York Jets got, you know [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=33.12s)]
*  Arguably the best quarterback and not the best quarter one of the best top three quarterbacks in football [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=38.0s)]
*  No offense Patrick Mahomes and he tore his Achilles on the fourth play fifth play not ideal. Yeah, so there's a very Jets situation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=42.68s)]
*  Very Jets situation. Yeah, but you know, it's good that you were in Woody Johnson's former Stomach Grounds the Jets owner [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=49.92s)]
*  MAGA chud yeah [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=56.16s)]
*  Better that he's not the best for here and rather that than have healthier and writers have to say that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=58.92s)]
*  Well, listen Ben's sadness around sports aside. We've got a great show for you today [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=63.72s)]
*  We just wrapped an interview with President Biden's Secretary of State Tony Blinken. You'll hear him talk about Ukraine [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  I talk about a big speech Tony's given this week talk about you know [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=74.86s)]
*  Sort of views in the global south of the g20 of the United States. We talked about a potential US [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=79.42s)]
*  Saudi Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=84.22000000000001s)]
*  Normalization deal so a lot of ground covered there and then Ben and I are gonna talk about the latest from Russia and Ukraine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  Armenia and Azerbaijan a bunch of interesting updates about China the politics of presidential travel some good news out of Mexico [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=91.9s)]
*  The tragic earthquake in Morocco and then an update on everyone's least favorite soccer asshole in Spain [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=98.98s)]
*  Okay, so Russia Ukraine we asked Tony some of the like big picture strategy questions later in the show [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=106.18s)]
*  For that but some updates that are new this week [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  The first is that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=114.18s)]
*  Kim was reportedly accompanied by [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=118.62s)]
*  one of his goons in charge of munitions policies and then two other goons in charge of acquiring space satellites and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=121.14s)]
*  Nuclear capable submarines so no real secret here been about what the topics are of this this meeting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=128.18s)]
*  Republicans are highlighting the fact that the US has officially spent more than 100 billion on the war in Ukraine [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=134.46s)]
*  So according to a Fox News exclusive [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=138.7s)]
*  But this obviously comes as Biden is looking to get more funding out of Congress in Russia [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=140.54s)]
*  Putin was at an economic conference in Vladivostok Tuesday [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=144.94s)]
*  He gave a speech where he said the criminal case against Trump is an indication of the quote [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=148.1s)]
*  rottenness of the American political system [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=153.1s)]
*  He praised Elon Musk and claimed that 270,000 Russians have voluntarily signed up for military service in the past six or seven months [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=155.14s)]
*  So a couple parts trolling a couple parts [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=162.7s)]
*  military industrial complex [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  Trumpeting there been and then Russia also held some regional municipal elections recently giant air quotes around elections there by the way in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=167.62s)]
*  Territory they annex from Ukraine big surprise the pro-putin party won [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=175.02s)]
*  ABC News reported the poll workers were going to voters houses with like literally armed soldiers detaining people who wouldn't vote [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=179.82000000000002s)]
*  And then lastly then the merchant of death is getting into politics listeners probably remember Victor boot [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=186.46s)]
*  He's the the Russian arms dealer who has returned to Russia in a prisoner swap for WNBA player, Ritney Griner [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=191.74s)]
*  Boot is now standing in election in the town [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=197.42s)]
*  About 450 miles east of Moscow that was Vladimir Lenin's birthplace. So some sad news there Ben [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=200.05999999999997s)]
*  I think we both had hoped that Victor boot would make something of his life after getting out of prison [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  But instead he got involved in politics. So here we are. Yeah, no surprise there, you know these guys [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  Other than progression a lot of these guys have second lives [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=216.54s)]
*  But the you know, we obviously get to some of the stuff with Tony, you know the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=220.06s)]
*  The Kim Jong-un stuff, you know, it's really worrisome [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean the Russians have a lot that they can provide here in terms of long-range missile technology satellite technology [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=228.06s)]
*  So hopefully we'll have a read on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  Exactly what happens, you know, like that may take intelligence. It may not be something we know [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=237.22000000000003s)]
*  That's a big question. I have coming out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=241.34s)]
*  This is just like are we gonna have any sense of what the Russians might be doing in exchange for this ammunition? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  The only other thing that really stands out to me Tommy beyond what we get into with with Tony is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=248.5s)]
*  This Putin comment about Trump, you know, really echoing Trump's points, right and then the comment [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=254.06s)]
*  Clearly meant to appeal to Elon Musk's vanity [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=260.1s)]
*  I think it's a it's a little appetizer if you will for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  How much the Russians are probably gonna want to get involved in our politics? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=268.5s)]
*  It's existential for them, you know if Trump's elected [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=272.9s)]
*  The US support for Ukraine ceases, I think we should anticipate that so just think about what the stakes are for Vladimir Putin [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=276.02s)]
*  Yeah, and it's really binary. And so I think we should all prepare ourselves [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=282.78s)]
*  This has not been discussed much Trump has kind of made people weary about talking about Russian interference [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=286.18s)]
*  But this is an indication of what's to come. Yeah, it really is in in the the conflict is binary for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=290.34s)]
*  For Putin if Biden is around there'll be much more support for Ukraine if he's not or if really any of these Republicans come in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=297.78s)]
*  Support for Ukraine will probably go away. You're right. And by the way, there's a there's a trend of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=303.58s)]
*  Russians convicted of crimes abroad coming back home and getting into politics. There was the former KGB guy accused of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  Murdering a Russian defector in the UK. He joined the Duma [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=316.7s)]
*  There was a Maria Butina about Russian gun rights activists that got swirled up in the NRA here in the US [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=319.94s)]
*  And accused of being a spy. She also joined the Duma [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  So, you know, it's a proud a proud legacy there [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=328.26s)]
*  Then a little good news about the ongoing dispute between [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  Armenia and Azerbaijan in the disputed in Gorno-Karabakh region [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=334.7s)]
*  So Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  But the area is ethnically Armenian and for a long time was basically governed by pro-Armenian [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=342.3s)]
*  Separatist groups that situation on the ground changed in 2020 when Azerbaijan won back a bunch of territory in a war and more recently [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=348.38s)]
*  People have been quite concerned about Azerbaijan [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=356.22s)]
*  Blockading the only road linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh because it was causing a humanitarian crisis [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=360.22s)]
*  There were reports today that say Azerbaijan and Armenia have cut a deal to reopen that road [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=365.62s)]
*  Which is obviously a good thing for humanitarian reasons, but you know the the geopolitics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine really flow into [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=370.54s)]
*  Armenia and Azerbaijan as well [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=377.94000000000005s)]
*  Historically speaking, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a major event in the past [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=379.94000000000005s)]
*  Well [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  historically speaking [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=385.46s)]
*  Armenia has been an ally of Russia that seems to be changing maybe on Monday [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=387.14s)]
*  Armenia participated in a joint military exercise with the United States and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=391.56s)]
*  Armenia's first lady visit Ukraine recently to deliver aid. So I'm just curious Ben if you're if you're Putin, would you be happy? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=395.98s)]
*  You know upgrading relations with North Korea while losing Armenia as an ally or is this kind of like feel like a shrinking world for him? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=402.26s)]
*  Well, I think look the reality is that there used to be these Russian peacekeepers or you know who are in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=409.44s)]
*  Who are kind of charged with being in that region to kind of help manage things like the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=415.8s)]
*  And they were obviously pulled out [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=422.72s)]
*  Because Russians need all the troops they can get and the Russians weren't willing to kind of lean on [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=425.36s)]
*  Azerbaijan or Turkey which is very close to Azerbaijan to to to help resolve what was really a humanitarian crisis and a warning of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=431.12s)]
*  genocide by [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=439.04s)]
*  Leading voices on these issues in the international community. I think so it clearly shows a kind of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=441.24s)]
*  diminishing role for Russia in in that part of the Caucasus [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=448.24s)]
*  You know where Turkey might have more influence right or Azerbaijan is reflecting its muscles more [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  I think a key lesson here is I have to think that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=456.48s)]
*  This is no way resolved. There's a lot of threat for the people who are still [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  very vulnerable in the corner Karabakh [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  But if there has been incremental progress [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=468.24s)]
*  It's because I think there's been greater attention on this and I think you know, the Armenian American community in this country's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=470.24s)]
*  raised a lot of noise but so [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=477.0s)]
*  Increasingly has there been diplomatic pressure diplomatic attention on this and I think the lesson here is Russia is playing less of a role here [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=478.92s)]
*  But to prevent that from vacuum from being filled by you know, Azerbaijan trying to swallow up [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=486.56s)]
*  This territory and the people in it [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=493.76s)]
*  It's gonna take a lot of diplomatic attention from a lot of countries including United States and Europe [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=496.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think Tony actually was was making some calls over the weekend about this trying to help get it resolved, too [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=502.04s)]
*  Let's switch to China because you know, we've been talking a lot about China and its economic challenges lately [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=507.08s)]
*  I want more detail the last episode you did with Max when I was out had a great overview [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=511.84s)]
*  But I think one question we've asked ourselves Ben and we've asked some of our guests like her Campbell a couple weeks ago [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=516.64s)]
*  Is whether they think that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=522.4s)]
*  China's economic problems make it more or less likely to invade Taiwan [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  President Biden gave us the clearest answer. We've heard it during his press conference in Vietnam. Let's listen [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=530.04s)]
*  I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=536.16s)]
*  Matter of fact the opposite probably didn't have the the same capacity that it had before [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=540.12s)]
*  So, you know interesting in much more direct and I guess reassuring then [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=545.68s)]
*  More broadly though, you know the trajectory for US-China relations is pretty rocky [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=550.7s)]
*  No official announcement was released [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=555.38s)]
*  But there have been reports about directives to Chinese government employees and state-owned companies [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=557.5s)]
*  Ordering them to use domestic phone brands instead of Apple products. This comes as the Chinese tech giant Huawei released its new phone [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=561.58s)]
*  That's supposed to be an iPhone competitor [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=569.1400000000001s)]
*  The US has repeatedly warned about Huawei's connections to the Chinese military now this ban [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  You know the potential ban of Chinese government officials from owning [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=576.78s)]
*  Apple phones could be like the tit-for-tat for the US banning tick-tock [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=580.86s)]
*  But it spooked the hell out of Wall Street [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=585.94s)]
*  And people started to wonder if Apple get caught in an economic war and the stock price dropped 6% [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=589.22s)]
*  I think in a day and then finally Ben there was a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=594.46s)]
*  Report in the Times that was interesting worth reading which is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=597.22s)]
*  One that talked about how China is getting into the disinformation game even in deeper and use artificial intelligence [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=600.18s)]
*  Programs to sell a narrative that the wildfires in Maui were started by a secret American weather weapon [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  Previously most of China's disinformation has focused on core issues like Taiwan [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=613.0200000000001s)]
*  So this feels new and troubling but Ben, what did you make of that Biden assessment at the top about? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  The likelihood of a Taiwan invasion and then just sort of this broader trajectory in this economic war that's going [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=623.98s)]
*  I mean first of all, I I have to say it's I [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=629.6600000000001s)]
*  Don't think this much gain from commenting on you know, like I I look I understand [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=634.06s)]
*  I'm always some that the politicians actually want to answer the question. That's usually a good good thing. Yeah [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=638.74s)]
*  but in this case [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  Well at the end of the day the only person who knows the answer that question is Xi Jinping, you know [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=645.58s)]
*  I mean their economy could be great or it could be bad [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=649.82s)]
*  It's in what that guy's head is gonna determine what happens here [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=652.7s)]
*  and so [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=657.1s)]
*  I you know, I don't think it has impact in the real world per se [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=658.66s)]
*  I just think we don't necessarily know [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=662.38s)]
*  because they do have a significant military capability and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=665.82s)]
*  The current state of their economy unless it really falls off a cliff [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=669.94s)]
*  I'm not sure it cripples our capacity to do something [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=674.7800000000001s)]
*  I think that you know the the the Huawei piece it feels like them [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=678.98s)]
*  Hitting back at us for what have been really big export controls [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=684.74s)]
*  You know limits on technology going in and that speaks to kind of the separations taking place between the US and China [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=688.4599999999999s)]
*  And supply chains and particularly technology [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=695.5s)]
*  Which is you know, I think creates more vulnerabilities for them than us [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=699.26s)]
*  But it does create vulnerabilities for us, too [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think it raises this question of how far does this escalation go in both directions? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=704.0999999999999s)]
*  Because if it goes all the way, you know in terms of the tech space [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=709.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's a big deal for like an Apple and it makes your iPhones in China [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=712.92s)]
*  So it's a reminder that there is risk for us [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=716.86s)]
*  I think there's probably greater risk for for the Chinese in the score though [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=719.1s)]
*  And it may account for them being a little more aggressive in the disinformation space [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  They may see that this is a more existential conflict for them than just kind of a Taiwan issue [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=726.46s)]
*  They're doing that kind of Russia style stuff where they're creating divisions in the United States and that that shows them kind of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=731.86s)]
*  Getting ready for a pretty long conflict here. Yeah, the the the potential iPhone ban on government employees [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=737.78s)]
*  Did seem like a bit of a tit-for-tat [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=744.78s)]
*  Type response. I mean certainly China could decide to fuck with Apple fuck with their manufacturing and the crown jewel of the US economy [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=747.22s)]
*  But I think that would have massive ramifications for any company in China [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=754.96s)]
*  But then on this in disinformation story in New York Times, I just want to read one paragraph to you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=759.5s)]
*  Which is it said it's a quote if China does engage in influence operations for the election next year [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=763.78s)]
*  US intelligence officials have assessed in recent months [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=768.7s)]
*  It's likely to try to diminish President Biden and raise the profile of former President Donald J [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=771.6600000000001s)]
*  Trump while that may seem counterintuitive to Americans who remember mr [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=776.22s)]
*  Trump's effort to blame Beijing for what he called the China virus the intelligence officials have concluded that Chinese leaders prefer mr [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump he's called for pulling Americans out of Japan South Korea and other parts of Asia while mr [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=786.34s)]
*  Biden has cut off China's access to the most advanced chips and the equipment made to produce them [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  Sounds right, but very interesting and kind of surprising to me that the intelligencies would brief that yeah, but there's no question [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=795.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't think this is a close call, you know, there's no way that Donald Trump cares about Taiwan [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=802.32s)]
*  You know, he insulted Taiwan when he's asked about it. He said they stole the chips or something [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=807.26s)]
*  His his trade war was this kind of half-assed thing trying to get the Chinese to buy soybeans [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  Whereas the Biden administration is like literally choking off investment and tech inputs in Chinese economy [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=816.46s)]
*  And frankly just Trump's you know embarrassing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=822.22s)]
*  the embarrassing reality of Donald Trump discredits democracy and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=827.0600000000001s)]
*  Opens up a huge space for China to kind of move forward with a parallel world order that eclipses what the United States is doing [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=831.4200000000001s)]
*  All those alliances that the United States is trying to reinforce under Biden [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=838.62s)]
*  You get get on rocky waters if Trump is back. So I think this is not [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=843.02s)]
*  Much of a question I think it reminds us so like we just talked about Putin wanting to be involved in selection like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=849.06s)]
*  Russia and China decide they really want Donald Trump back in there and they both have good reasons for that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, we could be seeing things in this election that go beyond even what we saw in 2016 [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=859.7399999999999s)]

*  Yeah, it's a massive story here, by the way [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1054.58s)]
*  Like this is like a huge story broke when I was here a lot of discussion about it. I saw our friend David Lammy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1056.5s)]
*  He was on it very alarmed by it [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1061.8999999999999s)]
*  And and I think it it speaks to like a much more aggressive [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1064.82s)]
*  You know, we've seen the Chinese government do this [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1069.9399999999998s)]
*  Versions of this in places like Australia. We've seen them [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1073.2199999999998s)]
*  Try to project influence into Canada [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1077.86s)]

*  So I just think you know [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1105.42s)]
*  This is a pattern where governments are gonna have the Chinese aren't gonna stop doing it because we see Sunak raised it with G20 officials [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1106.22s)]
*  You're gonna this is gonna have to be about defense more than warning the Chinese off of it [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1112.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, getting a stern warning from Rishi Sunak. It's probably not gonna do it for anybody. Yeah [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1116.18s)]
*  So Ben speaking of China President Biden just finished this five-day swing to Asia [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1120.7800000000002s)]
*  He went to the G20 in India [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1124.9s)]
*  They pushed through some important developments and reforms to multinational development banks like the World Bank [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1126.98s)]
*  It's a big deal for these low and middle income countries and it helps the US counter [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1132.66s)]
*  China's investments through the Belt and Road Initiative [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1136.7s)]
*  Biden also went to Hanoi where the US upgraded relations with Vietnam [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1138.94s)]
*  Again a big deal in its own right in a reminder to the Chinese that were a Pacific power that we have alliances around them [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1143.6200000000001s)]
*  Etc I will say that human rights groups were not entirely thrilled about the trip [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1150.54s)]
*  They wanted to see Biden press Vietnam much harder on human rights issues [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1155.42s)]
*  There were also some reports think in the Wall Street Journal of a potential US Saudi deal to extract rare earth [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  Minerals from African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo that make my that combo makes my skin crawl [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1166.3400000000001s)]
*  But then that the the big story out of this trip [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  Of course wasn't the substance as you know, it never was for us on our foreign trips. It was about how [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1176.58s)]
*  Biden ended his press conference in Hanoi, maybe a little weirdly [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1182.6999999999998s)]
*  He said I'm going to bed which in my view is not a weird thing to say at like 10 15 p.m [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1187.1s)]
*  At night when the press conference ended but it led to a question I have for you [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1191.6599999999999s)]
*  Which is you know, first of all, feel free to discuss any of the substantive stuff from the trip [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1195.1s)]
*  But also second it's clear that the Biden team [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  Thinks that one way to push back on concerns about his age is to talk about these foreign trips [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1202.26s)]
*  Their first campaign ad is is about Biden's trip to Ukraine [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1208.42s)]
*  You know, we both know how hard it is to get coverage of foreign trips back in the US to the extent you do [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1213.3799999999999s)]
*  It's usually about like some political news of the day and not what you're actually doing [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1220.58s)]
*  like what do you think about the political value of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1224.34s)]
*  images and [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1227.78s)]
*  Coverage of these foreign trips for Joe Biden. I think you know, like we [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1229.3s)]
*  First of all, there's nothing new here, right? Like we both dealt with this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1234.02s)]
*  I mean, you know [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1237.3799999999999s)]
*  we could go on and on about all the times that [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1238.7s)]
*  Obama's we yelled at the press because they weren't covering substance, you know [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1242.34s)]
*  because one time Obama like bowed his head a tiny bit to the Japanese Emperor and a [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1245.58s)]
*  Five day trip to Asia became about you know him bowing. Yeah in the wrong way or like it looked like, you know [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1250.7s)]
*  President Obama used to you know get really annoyed and he take it out on his press staff [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1257.6799999999998s)]
*  You and I probably both got some of that because he was pissed that you know [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1262.1999999999998s)]
*  They didn't cover the g20 communique or something because they were focused on some optics issue back home [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1266.52s)]
*  This is this happens to everybody. So this is not you need to do a Biden, but I'm sympathetic to him. I think that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1272.0s)]
*  However, you can make it work for you. Look, they're not gonna cover [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1278.9599999999998s)]
*  The communique and there's some important things in the G20 communique, you know [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1282.8s)]
*  Financing for the World Bank is really important to you know, make a lot of progress in development [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1286.84s)]
*  But that's not the kind of stuff that people are going to talk about on cable television or even necessarily write about [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1290.64s)]
*  Where you can break through is kind of iconic [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1297.32s)]
*  Shots, right? Like, you know, you give a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1301.64s)]
*  You know you address a large crowd in foreign country [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1306.36s)]
*  You take a train to Ukraine as President Biden did right like I think one thing you know [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1309.82s)]
*  You have to consider is just going to the summit and giving a press conference [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1314.94s)]
*  Is a way to guarantee that you won't get your message out [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1318.78s)]
*  Because right because they don't care about the summit communique and they're gonna use the press conference to ask you a bunch of questions [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1321.74s)]
*  That are probably unrelated to the things you want to talk about [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1328.38s)]
*  And so I think the way to make it work and frankly the ads that they've run show that when you're you know [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1330.82s)]
*  You're out there in an iconic position [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1336.7s)]
*  Filling the role of the American presidency [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1339.54s)]
*  That breaks through those images do break through back home because people won't be proud of their president [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1341.98s)]
*  They want to see their president out there doing work and kind of inspiring people or standing up to dictators [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1346.5800000000002s)]
*  That's the that's the way to make the politics of foreign travel work [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1352.26s)]
*  Yeah, make it look big you're always gonna be you're always gonna be on defense at the summit press conference [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1356.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's the your press conference is never a great place to deliver your message [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1360.98s)]
*  Speaking of iconic moments in presidential speeches. Here's another quick clip. I can't imagine somebody like [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1365.1000000000001s)]
*  Osama bin Laden understanding [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1371.74s)]
*  The joy of Hanukkah that's George W Bush. We saw that on Twitter this morning and it made us laugh. It is funny though [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1374.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, like we're in this giant debate about like oh is it's a did Biden have a gaffe is [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1380.68s)]
*  He too old is Trump too old like hey George W [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1386.46s)]
*  Bush was pretty young and pretty fucking stupid and said crazy stuff all the time like Osama bin Laden not enjoying Hanukkah [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1389.8s)]
*  So maybe we recirculate some of those. Well, he might have a point that I don't think he's right [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1395.92s)]
*  I mean just just straight if we're going to substance not optics, right? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1401.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't think the lot of this was was an honor [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1405.04s)]
*  But you have you ever seen him at a say his loss by the way his loss his loss [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1408.36s)]
*  I never saw him light a menorah. I never you know, like it but but that's you know [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1411.76s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why I didn't end well fun. Yeah, it did not end well for mr. Bin Laden [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1415.84s)]
*  Okay, let's turn to our hemisphere because there's some good news out of Mexico where the country Supreme Court decriminalized abortion last week [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1419.12s)]
*  Mexico's congressional chambers were ordered to remove any criminal penalties for abortion from Mexican law by the end of its current legislative session [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1426.68s)]
*  This ruling lays the foundation for Mexico to begin providing abortion services and broaden access dramatically [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1433.44s)]
*  But that doesn't mean abortion services will now be readily available [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  Basically the the federal public health system [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1443.82s)]
*  Allowing abortion services to happen is very different than actually providing them in the past [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1446.4199999999998s)]
*  The health system has only been legally allowed to provide abortions in cases of rape or to preserve the mother's health [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1450.74s)]
*  Mexico is also likely to get its first female president in its [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1457.3799999999999s)]
*  2024 election as the ruling Morena Party announced that Claudia Scheinbaum will be its nominee [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1460.62s)]
*  She'll be facing off against the opposition coalition's nominee [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1466.22s)]
*  Sochitel Galvez who's also a woman they are both socially progressive they support decriminalizing abortion rights [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1470.5s)]
*  They're vying to succeed president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He is required to step down [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1476.06s)]
*  next year per the law [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1482.78s)]
*  Because he can't seek another term. He says he doesn't want any, you know influence in politics going forward and will step away completely [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1485.1s)]
*  Consider me very skeptical of that Ben. So Ben, I mean, it's great to see Mexico taking these steps forward on gender equity [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1491.6599999999999s)]
*  But it is also just very depressingly highlights the ways the US is backsliding constantly. Yeah [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1499.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and first of all, congratulations everybody who's worked for this for a long time in Mexico [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1505.26s)]
*  But the the reality is yeah, deeply Catholic country in Mexico. I mean obviously not everybody but like, you know deeply [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1509.62s)]
*  Established Catholic Church. They're taking the opposite direction the United States going to have a female president before we do [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1519.02s)]
*  You know, they're leading on this and I wish we would move in similar direction here. I share your [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1527.42s)]
*  Skepticism, I think almost party will be favored and I think he'll continue to be quite powerful [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1533.5400000000002s)]
*  but you know, it doesn't diminish the the importance of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1537.74s)]
*  If they do break that glass ceiling and certainly doesn't diminish the importance of the breakthroughs on an abortion. Yeah one story [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1541.7s)]
*  That's just worth flagging for folks in your times did a long piece on [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1547.5800000000002s)]
*  This decades-old mystery of what happened to 43 college students who went missing in 2014 [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1551.4199999999998s)]
*  It turns out they were shot at by police [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1556.78s)]
*  The cops then handed them over to drug cartels who murdered them on their behalf [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1559.6599999999999s)]
*  but the broader story is about the depth of corruption inclusion between [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1563.58s)]
*  Mexican officials the military the police lawmakers and drug cartels. So it's very very worth your time and worth reading because [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  It is appalling and sort of what we're dealing with in terms of the cartels down in [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1576.1399999999999s)]
*  Mexico where all the Republicans want to invade now, I guess or bomb them in some form or fashion [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1580.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we're going. That's where we're at. And so a couple more things here [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1586.8200000000002s)]
*  So I was off last week because I was in Morocco at a friend's wedding [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1591.0600000000002s)]
*  Marrakech is an insane choice for a venue for an LA based friend group [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1595.5s)]
*  Destination wedding but once we got there, it was very clear why my buddy Josh wanted to get married in Marrakech [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1601.02s)]
*  It's a beautiful city. We explored it [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1606.74s)]
*  We went out to the desert met incredible people. It's just like a life-changing experience [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1609.1s)]
*  It was because of that experience it was extra heartbreaking to see the earthquake and the reports now today of like [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1615.1s)]
*  2,900 deaths from this earthquake last Friday [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1621.22s)]
*  Marrakech is a very old city [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1624.5s)]
*  You know, there's the sort of inner walls are from the 12th century [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1625.94s)]
*  A lot of those walls came down one of the biggest mosque iconic mosque in the city was damaged [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1628.98s)]
*  The situation in the death toll is far far worse in rural areas [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1635.0s)]
*  Where a lot of the homes are just the clay and mud and bricks and people are crushed and there's been no [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1638.84s)]
*  Effort to help them yet [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1644.12s)]
*  I mean the government response has been slow and insufficient and you know, this will be a very long painful recovery [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1645.28s)]
*  So basically just wanted to raise it to say, you know, if you're considering [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1650.82s)]
*  Charitable donations. This is a great place to help out consider Morocco [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1655.8799999999999s)]
*  Especially charities that are run by Moroccans if you're on Twitter check out at food bank [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1661.36s)]
*  Maroc that's at food bank Maroc [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  That's a handle for a local food bank that some folks told us about when the wedding party was trying to figure out how to help [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1670.48s)]
*  out [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1675.72s)]
*  USAID has great options listed on their website. We'll put that in the show notes. I [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1676.76s)]
*  Donated to an organization called give directly which is an international organization [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1681.36s)]
*  But I think what's great about them is they just give people cash [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1685.84s)]
*  Which is usually what you need in a situation like this, so there's a lot of really horrible things happening right now [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1688.12s)]
*  I was just reading Ben about how there's 2,000 people reportedly dead and 10,000 missing after flooding in Libya [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1693.44s)]
*  So there's a massive need everywhere. So just wanted to flag both. Yeah [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1700.36s)]
*  No, and I think the local charities point is well taken and so is this cash point? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1704.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, oftentimes you're trying, you know [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1708.12s)]
*  the national community is trying to figure out these needs and what what is needed and [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1710.32s)]
*  You know, it's hard to move certain resources down there [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1714.24s)]
*  But a lot of time what people need is cash and they can make decisions for themselves and if they're desperate [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  They're gonna spend it on what they need with that shelter food, whatever so [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1721.08s)]
*  People should definitely look for ways to provide support a quick update on soccer in Spain a couple weeks back [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1725.6399999999999s)]
*  We talked about Luis Rubelles the head of the Spanish Soccer Federation [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1731.48s)]
*  He's the guy who kissed a player named Jenny Hermoso on the lips after her team won the Women's World Cup [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  That kiss was not welcomed. It was not consensual [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1742.32s)]
*  It set up this firestorm of criticism a lot of people were calling on him to leave [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1744.96s)]
*  Including many of the players elected officials in Spain, but he dug in his heels for a while [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1749.32s)]
*  The good news as of this recording is that after weeks of pressure Rubelles finally resigned this was far from his first scandal [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1754.64s)]
*  He was accused of hosting orgies with Soccer Federation money. By the way, his uncle was the one who made those accusations [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1762.24s)]
*  So this is not some crazy source, but then so obviously good news [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1768.52s)]
*  It is worth hearing a quick clip from Ruby Alice from Pierce Morgan show of all places where he went to sort of announce his [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1773.4s)]
*  Retirement. Just take a look about my resignation. Yes, I'm going to do [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1780.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to yes because I cannot continue my work. What was the final moment for you? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1785.6s)]
*  Was it talking to your family your dad perhaps? Yeah, my father [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1791.56s)]
*  My daughters I spoke with with them and [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1796.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not they know is is not a question about me and some friends very very close to me [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1799.72s)]
*  And they say to me Luis now [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1808.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to focus in your dignity and to continue your life [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1811.0800000000002s)]
*  because [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1816.3200000000002s)]
*  If not, probably you are going to damage people you love on the sport [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1817.76s)]
*  Didn't hear a lot of apologizing there, but it didn't sounds a little bit like you might think he's a victim [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1822.52s)]
*  But you know, I guess it's good that he's gone. Yeah auditioning for like a you know [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1826.32s)]
*  very [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1830.8s)]
*  Low listenership podcasts where you can vent against, you know, we'll we'll mind virus and things like that. Oh, man [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1832.72s)]
*  good good riddance that guy [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1839.2s)]
*  Chased by the women of Spain particularly the women on the soccer team. So [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1841.56s)]
*  There is occasionally justice in this world. Yeah, he'll definitely watch a soccer show on X [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1847.2s)]
*  That Elon will say has like a trillion views a couple dumb things before we get to Tony's interview [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1851.76s)]
*  So a Florida man, of course [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1856.44s)]
*  Was arrested after trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a vessel that is basically a floating hamster wheel [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1859.0s)]
*  So he would run in this thing and it would turn and that would propel him East I guess [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1865.28s)]
*  44 year old Reza Baluchi was intercepted 70 miles off the coast of Georgia [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1870.88s)]
*  The state of Georgia according to BBC News [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1876.32s)]
*  He has tried to make journeys like this three times before every time he gets intercepted and picked up by the Coast Guard [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1878.44s)]
*  This guy was so pissed [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1883.44s)]
*  He got picked up this time that he refused to get out of his hamster wheel for three days and at one point [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1884.64s)]
*  He even claimed there was a bomb on board [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1888.48s)]
*  Then in 2021 he tried to drive a similar hamster wheel from Florida to New York via the ocean [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1890.52s)]
*  He said it was for charity, but he ended up 30 miles south of where he started [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1897.76s)]
*  So apparently he's not very good at driving this thing [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1901.0800000000002s)]
*  It seems like a good thing that the Coast Guard keeps rescuing this guy from himself [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1903.6799999999998s)]
*  But I do wonder at some point when they're gonna be like, okay, buddy, like go with God see you in London or never [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1907.72s)]
*  Yeah, or like a very large like, you know sea creature comes up and mistakes him for a hamster, right? Yeah [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1914.36s)]

*  600,000 gallons of wine flowing down their streets after two tanks at a local distillery burst [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1931.24s)]
*  Nobody was hurt local firefighters were able to prevent the wine from flowing into a river at a lake and sort of messing up [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1936.2s)]
*  the the local ecosystem there but [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1942.44s)]
*  It turns out a bunch of European countries are trying to figure out how to manage a big wine surplus [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1945.44s)]
*  I've heard there's a lack of demand in France Spain and Italy [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1950.1200000000001s)]
*  This wine in particular that got spilled in in Portugal was going to be distilled into other products and owners are gonna drink it [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1953.3600000000001s)]
*  Necessarily, this is all from a great report in the Washington Post but then you're in Europe now [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1959.8799999999999s)]

*  Just kind of calculating my head how long it is to get to Portugal. I'm actually gonna be in France tomorrow [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1968.08s)]
*  So I'm gonna try to make a dent on this and if anybody wants to ship some of that wine over to the Kruger media HQ [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1972.28s)]

*  97,000 gallon winery tank burst open in Sonoma and flooded the Russian River Valley. So that seems like this is an ongoing issue [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=1990.08s)]

*  You know of like what what is this kind of what is the moment that we're in? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  Geopolitically and how is your job different today than it would have been in in the Obama administration of the Clinton administration [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2237.0s)]
*  So Ben, I think as we're looking at it, we really see this moment as an inflection point by which I mean this [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2243.08s)]
*  We've all been living through working through what was called the post-cold war era [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2250.0s)]
*  And as we see it that era has come to an end and [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2255.44s)]
*  There's an intense competition on to shape what comes next and we're seeing that in a couple of ways. We're seeing that with this [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2259.32s)]
*  renewed but also in many ways new [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2265.7200000000003s)]
*  Great power rivalry and competition. We're also seeing it though with a whole host of [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2268.88s)]
*  profound [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2275.28s)]
*  transnational challenges that are putting new and extraordinary demands on [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2276.84s)]
*  governments and [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2282.36s)]
*  International organizations much more so than ever before whether it's climate whether it's mass migration [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2284.0s)]
*  whether it's the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2290.6s)]
*  food insecurity that we're seeing energy challenges [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2292.64s)]
*  emerging technologies and [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2296.4s)]
*  For a variety of reasons we've come to a moment where so many of the benefits that we thought would accrue from the end of the cold [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2299.48s)]
*  war [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2305.88s)]
*  Benefits which in many ways we we saw but not to the extent and not with the durability that we hoped [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2306.96s)]
*  we're seeing that [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2314.08s)]
*  in many ways being being questioned and come to an end and we are [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2315.68s)]
*  Engaged heavily in how we shape [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2320.24s)]
*  the next period of time in a way that reflects what we want to achieve which is [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2322.68s)]
*  Broadly speaking a world that's that's free. That's open that's secure. That's prosperous. That's connected [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2328.08s)]
*  and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2333.92s)]
*  the importance of an inflection point moment and I'll stop with that is that [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2335.36s)]
*  Almost by definition you get to one of those moments and they come around every six or seven generations [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2340.1200000000003s)]
*  The decisions that we make now the way we organize ourselves at home [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2345.84s)]
*  The way we organize ourselves in the world are likely to shape what things look like not just for the next few years [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2349.54s)]
*  But for the next decades we believe we're at that kind of moment. So I'm gonna one of the big sort of inbox issues is for you [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2355.6400000000003s)]
*  Guys lately has been Ukraine and you just got back from your third trip. I believe since the war started [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2361.7200000000003s)]
*  It's been raging for a year and a half the US has provided an enormous amount of assistance Ukraine [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2367.32s)]
*  I think I read today that the number is topped 100 billion [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2372.2s)]
*  Ben and I watched the Republican primary foreign policy debates very closely and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2375.88s)]
*  The the arguments are generally against US support for Ukraine and they're very simple and they're very clear, right? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2381.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like we should be spending that money here. We should be securing our border here [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2386.28s)]
*  The risk of escalation with Russia is constant if not growing [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2389.48s)]
*  I [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2393.2400000000002s)]
*  even hear supporters of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2394.6s)]
*  The US the war effort in Ukraine saying, you know, our message is more complicated. We don't know what success looks like [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2397.04s)]
*  We don't know what the endgame is. We're worried about the counteroffensive maybe stalling or struggling [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2403.36s)]
*  We're worried about there not being sort of public peace talks [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2409.48s)]
*  And I was just wondering if you could help the listeners understand like what our core objectives are in Ukraine and what? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2412.28s)]
*  Success looks like so they can try to figure out what an endgame might be so Tommy [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2419.2s)]
*  First it's it's important to to step back and look at the stakes of Ukraine for us and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2423.08s)]
*  Indeed for for folks around the world. Look first, I think most Americans just [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2429.72s)]
*  Inherently don't like to see one big country bully another it's something that [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2435.84s)]
*  we [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2442.12s)]
*  generally object to and [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2443.32s)]
*  Where we can want to do something about so when we see the brutalization of Ukraine by by Russia [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2445.08s)]
*  When we see what's being done on a daily basis [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2451.5600000000004s)]
*  To bomb not only its cities but to bomb its people its infrastructure [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2454.8s)]
*  When we see some of the atrocities that have been committed [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2458.6000000000004s)]
*  By Russian forces in Ukraine. That's something that gets people rightly concerned and upset but [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2461.88s)]
*  Fundamentally, there's something even larger at stake, which is this is not only an aggression against Ukraine [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2468.84s)]
*  It's an aggression against some very basic principles that we labored long and hard to try to establish [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2474.04s)]
*  After two world wars to try to ensure that it would be less likely that we have another world war and certainly less likely that we'd [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2479.88s)]
*  Have conflict and that we'd have a greater chance at building peace and stability [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2486.08s)]
*  A lot of this is enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other places and it basically says [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2489.28s)]
*  One country doesn't have the right to go in change the borders with another by force [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2494.36s)]
*  Try to take it over try to do what Russia did which was to erase Ukraine's identity [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2498.56s)]
*  Erase it from the maps of sumit into Russia [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2502.8s)]
*  Because if we allow that to go on check if we allow that to go forward with impunity [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2505.0s)]
*  Then it opens a Pandora's box. It's open season every would-be aggressor around the world will say well [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2509.52s)]
*  If Russia can get away with it [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2515.88s)]
*  So can we and Russia itself the idea that it would stop at simply trying to take over Ukraine [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2517.32s)]
*  It would stop there. I think is is very misguided. So [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2523.1800000000003s)]
*  Not doing something about this is a recipe for a world of conflict that we know from history [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2527.4s)]
*  Draw draws the United States in in ways that cost a lot more toil and treasure [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2534.2799999999997s)]
*  And blood than we are than we're seeing now [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2540.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think that's the the big piece that's that's so important [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2543.36s)]
*  The other big piece is this this is not just the United States standing with and standing up for Ukraine [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2547.2999999999997s)]
*  It's dozens of countries around the world and we've built different coalitions to deal with different aspects of this the military peace [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2551.68s)]
*  The economic and reconstruction piece the energy piece the humanitarian piece and [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2559.64s)]
*  You're seeing countries from around the world coming in and standing with Ukraine. The ultimate objective [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2564.0s)]
*  Really Tommy is twofold [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2569.44s)]
*  first of course is to [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2571.12s)]
*  deny Russia any kind of strategic success in Ukraine because if we don't then as I said [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2572.8399999999997s)]
*  It's open invitation for aggressors everywhere and already it's really important to note that Russia has failed and what it was trying to accomplish [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2578.52s)]
*  Because its goal as I said was to erase Ukraine from the map to end its identity as an independent country to subsume it into Russia [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2584.96s)]
*  That's already failed where exactly the settles exactly where the lines are drawn [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2591.32s)]
*  That's fundamentally up to the Ukrainians and we want to stand with them to [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  Maximize their ability to take back the remaining territory that Russia seized Russia still controls about 17% [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2601.1600000000003s)]
*  Of Ukraine but not only that to ensure that Ukraine not only survives but also thrives and that gets into [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2608.04s)]
*  supporting it economically and supporting its democratic emergence [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2614.78s)]
*  But the objective is to make sure that Ukraine can stand on its own feet. This is not a recipe for some kind of [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2618.34s)]
*  indefinite [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2625.7000000000003s)]
*  You know support by the entire world to keep Ukraine going. It's getting Ukraine to a point where militarily [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2627.3s)]
*  economically [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2634.42s)]
*  Democratically it can stand strongly on its own [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2635.7400000000002s)]
*  It seems clear that you know [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2638.1400000000003s)]
*  Putin is struggling to get the resources necessary to conduct this war [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2639.58s)]
*  He is reportedly meeting with Kim Jong-un today in Russia [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2644.64s)]
*  A lot of analysts though are saying, you know [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2647.7799999999997s)]
*  Are looking at this meeting and saying this is significant and worrisome evolution of the Russia [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2650.2s)]
*  North Korea relationship because North Korea finally is something that Putin actually wants in this case artillery shells [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2654.7799999999997s)]
*  You can use that as leverage to extract something that might worry us a lot like, you know [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2660.46s)]
*  Yeah military technology to launch missiles spy satellites nuclear technologies [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2666.58s)]
*  It's notable that Kim is accompanied by two aids that I believe managed like the satellite program and manage their acquisition of nuclear capable [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2671.54s)]
*  submarines, for example [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2679.06s)]
*  How worried are you about this deepening? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2680.54s)]
*  Partnership between Russia and North Korea and the potential for North Korea to get these more modern weapons or sort of nuclear infrastructure [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2683.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think this says two things to us first [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2690.02s)]
*  It says that Russia is increasingly desperate [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2693.02s)]
*  Desperate because of the effectiveness of the Ukrainians and pushing them back [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2696.26s)]
*  Desperate because the sanctions and export controls that so many countries have imposed on Russia are denying it [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2699.5s)]
*  The technology that it needs to replace and even modernize its military and its weaponry [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2705.94s)]
*  So it's looking wherever it can and of course right now [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2710.6600000000003s)]
*  It's looking primarily to North Korea and to Iran on one level. That's kind of a Star Wars bar scene. Yeah of countries [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2713.5s)]
*  So I think it does speak to Russia's desperation on the other hand, it's also true that we don't want to see [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2721.76s)]
*  Russia be in a position where it can strengthen the capabilities that's bringing to dealing with [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2729.04s)]
*  the aggression on Ukraine and we also [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2734.64s)]
*  Don't want to see North Korea benefiting from whatever technologies it might get from Russia and same with Iran where there's also a two-way street [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2737.48s)]
*  Relationship that's developing we're working with with other countries [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2745.12s)]
*  We're taking our own actions to try to disrupt as much of that as we possibly can [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2749.78s)]
*  of course the relationship between Russia and North Korea that's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2755.1s)]
*  Moving forward now is in violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2758.78s)]
*  We're looking to make sure that we as necessary can impose costs and consequences [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2763.54s)]
*  But I also think it's having the effect of further isolating these countries from the rest of the world one question following on both [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2768.58s)]
*  You know this inflection point you mentioned and and Ukraine [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2774.54s)]
*  You know, you were recently in India for the G20 [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2778.5800000000004s)]
*  and [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2782.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, it was interesting because that came shortly after for India the BRICS summit that got a lot of attention in South Africa [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2784.78s)]
*  And so we've seen kind of India, you know comfortable at the BRICS summit comfortable in Washington to state visit [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2791.6200000000003s)]
*  but I want to ask more generally about the the global south and [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2798.1000000000004s)]
*  Countries like India and countries and places like Southeast Asia and in Africa that have been you know [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2801.78s)]
*  Much more reticent to come embrace the Ukrainian side of this war in the same way that you know, say our European allies have [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2807.62s)]
*  Is there a risk, you know because it feels like you know here in the United States and in Europe and in some of our Asian allies [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2815.94s)]
*  Okay, the Ukraine war is an inflection point the Ukraine war itself is kind of representative of the inflection point that you talk about [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2822.78s)]
*  But it does feel like you know almost a couple years into this war [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2829.82s)]
*  That's not a view that is shared in the global south and that if anything [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2834.54s)]
*  there might even be a risk that [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2839.54s)]
*  our focus on Ukraine is [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2842.02s)]
*  Not where their heads are at, you know, they're thinking about climate change or they're thinking about development or they're thinking about [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2844.54s)]
*  emerging technologies [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2851.18s)]
*  How do you balance this risk between wanting to you know, get a statement at the G20? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2853.1s)]
*  expressing support for Ukraine [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2858.9s)]
*  Versus maybe not meeting these countries where they are in which they're like, you know [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2861.82s)]
*  I don't like the fact there's this war but I don't really want to get involved in it [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2866.34s)]
*  And why aren't you talking to us about what we care about? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2869.9s)]
*  What would you say to that kind of line of critique that we hear a lot from some elements of the global south? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2872.1s)]
*  Sure, I bet I think two things first if you look at [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2877.82s)]
*  What we've been able to do over the last year and a half with regard to the rest of the world in Russia's aggression against Ukraine [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2881.7400000000002s)]
*  On multiple occasions. We've had more than 140 countries at the United Nations [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2888.46s)]
*  clearly [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2892.9s)]
*  Stand up for territorial integrity [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2894.3s)]
*  Independence sovereignty and against the Russian aggression that clues includes many most of the the countries in the so-called [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2896.82s)]
*  Global south because I think they understand that the principles I was talking about earlier are principles that matter to them, too [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2903.62s)]
*  And so again, we've seen them stand up similarly with some of the support that we've helped to build for Ukraine [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2910.42s)]
*  As I said, it's not just the military piece. It's the economic and reconstruction piece. It's its energy [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2916.88s)]
*  It's humanitarian a number of these countries have taken part in pieces of this which goes to the kinds of [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2923.04s)]
*  Varied coalitions that we're building on any given issue [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2929.4s)]
*  What I like to call variable geometry because what we're doing is we're putting together for for very fit-for-purpose reasons [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2932.08s)]
*  different collections of countries [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2939.0s)]
*  different sizes different shapes of coalitions to address specific problems [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2941.44s)]
*  That's one piece but the other piece is exactly what you said [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2945.92s)]
*  We have to and we are [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2949.1200000000003s)]
*  Demonstrating that we're focused on the issues that matter most to them and that we are [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2951.28s)]
*  the answer to many of the the problems that they're facing and [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2956.04s)]
*  Russia in this particular case is a big part of the problem food security to take one example [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2960.84s)]
*  the combination of over the last few years of [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2966.32s)]
*  climate change of kovat and of conflict and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2970.2000000000003s)]
*  Particularly now the Russian aggression against Ukraine [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2972.92s)]
*  Has a devastating consequences for countries particularly in the global south when it comes to food insecurity [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2975.2400000000002s)]
*  The breadbasket of the world Ukraine Russia preventing Ukraine from exporting its grain and its wheat [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2981.6s)]
*  Initiative by the United Nations to allow that to happen the Black Sea Grain Initiative [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2987.44s)]
*  which when it was in effect allowed 30 million tons of [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2991.64s)]
*  Grain to get out of of Ukraine the equivalent of 18 billion loaves of bread the Russians recently tore that up [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=2995.68s)]
*  Who does that hurt the most? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3001.96s)]
*  The very countries in the developing world that desperately needed even countries that weren't direct recipients of Ukrainian grain are affected by the fact that prices go up [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3003.7599999999998s)]
*  When grain is kept off the market? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3011.8399999999997s)]
*  We've put together a coalition of countries around the world to deal effectively with food insecurity both [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3014.56s)]
*  Emergency assistance where we're the number one provider around the world as well as long-term [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3020.16s)]
*  Support to help these countries build their sustainable productive capacity [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3026.2s)]
*  So that they're not the prisoners of a country like Russia weaponizing food [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3029.96s)]
*  I can go across the board on the things that countries are actually looking for and want [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  Infrastructure a huge demand for infrastructure around the world. Well [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3040.04s)]
*  Thanks to what President Biden's done starting with the g7 and now expanded to the the g20 [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3044.24s)]
*  We have a very significant program of infrastructure investment [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3048.7599999999998s)]
*  That is bringing countries together to catalyze private sector investment to respond to these needs [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3052.9s)]
*  But to do it as a race to the top [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3058.66s)]
*  Not a race to the bottom that these countries have experienced when they've had other significant supporters of infrastructure [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3060.7000000000003s)]
*  do it in a way that builds to shoddy standards that doesn't pay attention to the environment or the [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3066.94s)]
*  the rights and needs of workers and that [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3072.7400000000002s)]
*  You know puts a huge amount of debt on countries that they can't afford [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3076.1s)]
*  We're in the process of reforming the international financial system so that countries have greater access to capital [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3079.4199999999996s)]
*  so that they have ways of getting debt relief that they can make more manageable the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3084.98s)]
*  Needs that that they have and of course working to make sure we have a Security Council to the United Nations [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3091.8199999999997s)]
*  It's better reflective of the world of today not the world that [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3097.54s)]
*  Existed when the Security Council was formed. So in these and so many other ways [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3101.5s)]
*  We've been demonstrating that yes [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3105.5s)]
*  We're focused on the agenda that most countries around the world want us to focus on and in this moment a country like Russia is [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3107.6200000000003s)]
*  The main disruptor of that agenda and is it one more thing on this? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3114.7000000000003s)]
*  Are you you know, it's interesting that the g20 just happened before that the BRICS summit [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3120.3s)]
*  You know, we've obviously had a g7 which you guys have referred to I think it a you know [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3125.7400000000002s)]
*  Interesting a good bumper sticker, you know the steering committee of the free world [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3130.2200000000003s)]
*  But we're also you know, the UN meetings are coming up and it you know, these are my words not yours [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3134.38s)]
*  It feels like the UN is far less capable of being a place of collective action [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3140.5s)]
*  I mean for the obvious reason that you know [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3145.98s)]
*  Russia is not gonna let anything get to the Security Council and anything that we care about for instance [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3147.94s)]
*  Is there a worry that that yes, you're building these coalitions [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3153.54s)]
*  And good strong coalitions of like-minded countries on different issues like you said [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3159.0s)]
*  the variable geometry at which I did not do well in geometry and [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3165.04s)]
*  school, but but I get you mean like you you have quads and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3169.8s)]
*  Orientations in the Asia you had to try a lot with Korea and Japan at Camp David [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3174.28s)]
*  G7 but you know, then China's building its own blocks, you know [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3180.16s)]
*  Are you worried a bit that that part of what's happening is the world sorting out into kind of competing [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3183.92s)]
*  Blocks and rather than having that system that coordinates collective action that there's a system being built that is [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3190.44s)]
*  Really, you know an us-versus-them system even that that's not the intention the United States that that may be the effect of what's happening [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3197.48s)]
*  And this at this moment. Look, there's no doubt that the international system [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3203.92s)]
*  The UN system is challenged in many ways, but that's not a reason to give up on it [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3208.96s)]
*  it's a question it's actually a reason to [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3214.0400000000004s)]
*  Double down lean in and seek to make it more effective and again more reflective of the world as you might put it as it is [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3216.6000000000004s)]
*  Not as it as it once was good book plug there Tony like that. I appreciate that seamless. Yeah, I'm trying [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3224.28s)]
*  And and and that's not purely out of out of altruism [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3231.0800000000004s)]
*  It's because it's in our interest to do it [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3234.84s)]
*  the fact of the matter is [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3236.86s)]
*  Virtually none of the problems that we have to face around the world and they're having an effect on the lives of our fellow citizens [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3238.5s)]
*  Our problems that we can effectively address alone is as strong and powerful as we are we benefit profoundly from having [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3244.44s)]
*  these alliances these partnerships these coalitions and [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3251.0s)]
*  An effective international system that can pick up some of the burden because if not [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3253.84s)]
*  Then either we're gonna be stuck doing it alone at much greater cost or no one does it [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3258.44s)]
*  And then you're gonna have a vacuum that is just filled by bad things before it's filled with with good things [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3263.32s)]
*  So we have an interest in making sure that the UN can operate [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3268.1000000000004s)]
*  effectively through its programs for example [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3271.1400000000003s)]
*  on food security on on maternal health on climate you name it and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3273.6800000000003s)]
*  To some extent even if you have relative paralysis at the Security Council for the reasons you said that doesn't mean that [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3280.1800000000003s)]
*  These different programs aren't functioning and having a positive impact [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3288.0s)]
*  Again in ways that if they weren't around we'd have to pick up the slack. So we're working on that [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3292.9s)]
*  I look I'd like to see a Security Council that functions, but [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3297.7799999999997s)]
*  That is very challenging at a time [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3300.7799999999997s)]
*  when you have the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3303.02s)]
*  antagonisms that we have with [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3305.3399999999997s)]
*  With Russia and the competition that we have with with China, but we're we're also looking at seeing this Ben [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3307.74s)]
*  And this is what I'm finding is I travel around the world [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3313.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a demand signal from countries around the world that we the United States lead responsibly and that means [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3317.0s)]
*  dealing with what you were talking about a few minutes ago, which is focusing on the things that matter to them and [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3324.6000000000004s)]
*  Also trying to find ways to move forward and try to make the the UN and other in international institutions [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3329.0s)]
*  more effective and [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3335.7200000000003s)]
*  If and as we do that or at least as we're seen and caught trying that actually benefits us in our leadership around the world [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3337.88s)]
*  Tony last question for you. Thank you again for your time [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3344.94s)]
*  There have been a bunch of news reports about a possible US broker [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3347.5800000000004s)]
*  Normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia now [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3352.06s)]
*  I know you wouldn't ever comment on a deal that's not finalized nor would you get ahead of [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3355.2200000000003s)]
*  President Biden if a deal was correct [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3359.46s)]
*  But I was hoping you might help us understand why you know [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3362.1400000000003s)]
*  The administration thinks now is the moment where it might be advantageous to cut a deal with the Saudis and Israelis [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3366.42s)]
*  Because in Israel, you know, there have been months of protests over changes to the judiciary [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3371.78s)]
*  People like Ehud Barak said that these changes could turn Israel into quote de facto dictatorship [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3376.42s)]
*  Where there's questions about the future of Israel's democracy over in Saudi Arabia [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3381.7400000000002s)]
*  It obviously of course already is a dictatorship [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3385.42s)]
*  The Crown Prince has an ever-worsening human rights record [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3387.98s)]
*  The most recent iteration of that was reports that border guards were shooting at Ethiopian migrants as part of a policy [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3391.54s)]
*  MBS has a tendency to undercut US interests. I mean cards on the table obviously in case it's not obvious already [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3399.1s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of BB or MBS, but I'm wondering sort of like why why help these two leaders out now? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3405.22s)]
*  It seems like a big political win for two folks who fight against President Biden's political wins on a regular basis [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3412.38s)]
*  Well first Tommy this this and and most things that we do are not about individual leaders or individual governments [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3418.14s)]
*  They're about the the substance of the issue and whether we can in whatever in whatever we're doing [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3423.8799999999997s)]
*  Advance the world that's a little bit more peaceful a little bit more prosperous a little bit more full of opportunity [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3430.72s)]
*  And there's no question in my mind that if we could help achieve [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3436.8399999999997s)]
*  Normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia it would move the world in that direction [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3442.12s)]
*  We've had extraordinary turmoil in that part of the world going back to at least 1979 decades of turmoil [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3445.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3451.56s)]
*  Moving away from that having more moderating and integrating [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3453.0s)]
*  Dynamics [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3459.96s)]
*  Carry things forward. I think would be a profound change and a profound change for the good and a change that would again [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3461.6s)]
*  Not be tied to any specific [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3468.64s)]
*  Government but to the the fundamental interests of the countries involved now. This is really hard to do and [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3470.7999999999997s)]
*  there's a lot that that goes into it and [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3477.68s)]
*  unclear whether whether we get there [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3479.92s)]
*  But there's no doubt in my mind that if we if we could it would be good for us [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3482.88s)]
*  Good for the countries in question good for the region and indeed good for the the world beyond if you have the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3486.92s)]
*  Leading [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3494.6000000000004s)]
*  Muslim country in the world [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3497.76s)]
*  Islamic country in the world making peace with Israel that's going to have benefits that travel well beyond the region now one very important [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3499.36s)]
*  piece to this [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3506.92s)]
*  Normalization any of the efforts that are going on to improve relations between Israel and its and its neighbors are [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3509.76s)]
*  Not cannot be a substitute for Israel and the Palestinians [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3515.88s)]
*  resolving their differences and [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3521.32s)]
*  Having a much better future [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3524.36s)]
*  For Palestinians and in our judgment, of course that must needs to involve a two-state solution. So [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3526.96s)]
*  It's also clear from what we hear from the the Saudis that if this process is to move forward [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3532.96s)]
*  The Palestinian peace is going to be very important, too [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3538.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that is the big question right because the previous Abraham Accord normalization deals have said to the Palestinians [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3540.36s)]
*  You know kind of you get breadcrumbs if not and if nothing at all [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3546.48s)]
*  You know, I was just in Morocco where I was I was recalling how Jared Kushner [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3550.76s)]
*  Handed over [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3555.28s)]
*  Control of an entire disputed region to the Moroccan government as part of the Abraham Accord deals and I was just you know [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3558.2000000000003s)]
*  trying to figure out [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3563.88s)]
*  To what extent a normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3565.52s)]
*  Is viewed as something that would aid a Middle East peace process or efforts to get a Palestinian state that has seemed to be [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3570.4s)]
*  You know been on ice for a while [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3577.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, look that's clearly something that's important to the Saudis and in doing any kind of doing any kind of deal [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3579.0800000000004s)]
*  Would be important to us, too [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3584.32s)]
*  But I think [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3586.2799999999997s)]
*  Every country involved if this is to move forward [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3588.64s)]
*  Will clearly find significant [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3593.7999999999997s)]
*  tangible benefit in it in the in the near term [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3596.64s)]
*  But again, this is even more about putting in place a foundation for a much different future one [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3600.12s)]
*  That is more peaceful. That is more secure. That is more prosperous in [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3606.56s)]
*  moderating so many of [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3612.2799999999997s)]
*  These different problems and passions that have led to turmoil over the last decades and [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3614.4s)]
*  through the process of integration [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3620.52s)]
*  That is going to deliver much more tangible benefits to people in all of these countries and throughout the region [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3622.6400000000003s)]
*  That's the that's the goal now again whether we can whether we can get there the the jury's out because [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3628.32s)]
*  The the practical substance of this is challenging. It's it's hard, but we're working on it [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3634.8s)]
*  And I think the the labor is well worth [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3639.5600000000004s)]
*  The fruit that could be produced excellent well listen Tony [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSgNsTiG2U&t=3642.0s)]
