Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss the latest scandal engulfing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and why even his defenders say the Pentagon is in chaos, a report about the FBI Director’s jet-setting lifestyle, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s mindless reorganization of the State Department. They also talk about Pope Francis’ moral leadership on global affairs, how China is winning the trade war and concern that the impact of Trump’s tariffs might be irreversible, why US airstrikes on the Houthi rebels have failed to deter them, a new political crisis for Israeli PM Bibi Netanyahu, the latest from Gaza, and why Swedes are Netflix and chilling to the Moose Migration.

# Trump’s Pentagon in CHAOS After Another Hegseth Screw-Up
**Pod Save the World:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1.2s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2.08s)]
*  You're not coming to DC this weekend. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4.66s)]
*  I've been to eight White House Correspondents dinners, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=5.44s)]
*  at which there were not at least that many fascists. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=8.84s)]
*  So I'm glad you're going on my behalf, Tommy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=12.56s)]
*  The dress code this year is brown shirt. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=15.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=17.64s)]
*  I'm not going to the dinner. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=18.2s)]
*  I'm just going to DC for the pre stuff. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=19.28s)]
*  Yeah, I have the same feeling you do of too many fascists, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=22.32s)]
*  but also I think I just walk into that room [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=26.66s)]
*  and just feel massive anxiety about running into people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=29.04s)]
*  and forgetting their names. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=32.76s)]
*  Well, even by the eighth year, I mean, I was pretty over it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=34.44s)]
*  For those of you who have not had the pleasure, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=37.56s)]
*  picture like 1,000 people in a gigantic windowless room [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=40.32s)]
*  with the least attractive hotel furniture. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  You're at a round table with half the people you don't know [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  and a bunch of journalists looking for celebrities. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=54.36s)]
*  Every conversation, there's never eye contact. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=59.04s)]
*  It's someone looking 15 degrees to your right or left [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=62.36s)]
*  for someone more important. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=65.16s)]
*  That was my experience in DC. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=67.2s)]
*  The only good one was the night before we killed Bin Laden, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=69.12s)]
*  where all of us had to go so that they didn't notice [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=72.12s)]
*  that another national security people were there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's totally why I went to. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=77.28s)]
*  I was right into that thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  I just decided to go anyway. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=79.72s)]
*  I remember walking around, and every now and then, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=80.92s)]
*  I'd see one of the people who knew what was coming tomorrow, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=82.92s)]
*  and we'd make eye contact. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=84.88s)]
*  And it was like a little head nod. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I could have used a steerer, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=87.04s)]
*  because I got fucking wasted until 5 AM that night. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  It was just a mess when I got to the office the next day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  I almost wore a Celtics jersey into the office [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=93.48s)]
*  when you called me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=95.2s)]
*  Did not compromise the operation, though. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=95.76s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=97.28s)]
*  Not like Pete Hexen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Unlike Pete Hexen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=98.64s)]
*  Top story today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=99.68s)]
*  Great segue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=102.28s)]
*  So we're going to talk about the latest scandal engulfing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Pete Hexen, the Secretary of Defense, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  and just the general chaos of the Pentagon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty shocking, actually. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=109.68s)]
*  We'll get into Marco Rubio's plan, in air quotes, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  to reorganize the State Department. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Pope Francis's life and legacy and what comes next. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=115.96s)]
*  The latest on our idiotic, self-defeating trade war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=118.96s)]
*  How things are going against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  President Trump challenged us to check in with them, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  so we're going to do that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=126.16s)]
*  And a new scandal engulfing Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=127.28s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu, the latest from Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=129.44s)]
*  And then our interview today was a late scratch, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=131.68s)]
*  as they say in the sports world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=134.28s)]
*  We're not going to name names. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  But you're listening, and you know who you are. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=137.4s)]
*  You know you did. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=139.28s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=140.12s)]
*  It's like Lucy with the football. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=140.68s)]
*  It's hurtful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  Excited to talk to this individual. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  But maybe, just maybe, they'll come back on in the future. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Should we start with pistol Pete? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Start with pistol Pete, yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=151.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=152.88s)]
*  So the Pentagon is in complete and total chaos right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=153.56s)]
*  And I feel like it's just not really getting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=156.84s)]
*  the attention it deserves. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=158.6s)]
*  So we just want to kind of hammer this home for folks. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=159.72s)]
*  This latest mess comes via the New York Times, which [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  reported that Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  was part of a second signal group chat, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=167.64s)]
*  where he shared what was clearly classified operational details [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=170.32s)]
*  about an upcoming military strike on the Houthi rebels [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=173.96s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=176.44s)]
*  The Pentagon still says that it wasn't classified. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  They're just clearly lying about this, Ben. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Listeners probably remember Signal Gate 1.0 [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=181.56s)]
*  when Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=184.88s)]
*  created this signal group chat group [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=187.52s)]
*  to discuss bombing the Houthis. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  In this new Signal Gate 2.0, Hegseth [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=191.8s)]
*  shared basically the same information [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=195.0s)]
*  about the operation against the Houthis on the same day [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  as Signal Gate 1.0. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=202.08s)]
*  He shared information like what time the F-15s or the F-18s [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=203.52s)]
*  are going to bomb their targets, like very specific details [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=207.0s)]
*  about the military plan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  But this time, Hegseth shared that information [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=212.4s)]
*  with a new group that included his brother, his wife, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  and his personal lawyer for some reason. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=218.56s)]
*  The lawyer part really confuses me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=220.24s)]
*  So Signal Gate 1.0. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=222.72s)]
*  Well, maybe a good thing that that guy was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=224.28s)]
*  read in on the front end. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=225.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=226.8s)]
*  He made some work to do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=227.36s)]
*  He'll be doing some pro bono work on the back end. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=228.28s)]
*  So Signal Gate 1.0. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  I remember Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=232.76s)]
*  got looped in on that one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  But in that case, Hegseth clearly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=236.56s)]
*  screwed up by sharing classified information [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  on a commercially available app called Signal, which you're not [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=241.64s)]
*  allowed to share classified information on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=244.92s)]
*  But it was on a chain that was created by Mike Waltz [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  with individuals who have a need to know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=249.12s)]
*  about that kind of information. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=251.32s)]
*  They were actually debating whether or not [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=252.64s)]
*  to take this strike. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=254.2s)]
*  They're sort of debating it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  But with Signal Gate 2.0, Hegseth [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=256.56s)]
*  created this group himself. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=259.08s)]
*  He did it on his personal phone and was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=260.36s)]
*  sharing classified information with people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=262.2s)]
*  who have absolutely no need to know about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=264.24s)]
*  Like, his wife doesn't need to know what time we're bombing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=266.24s)]
*  whatever, Hodeya Port in Yemen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=269.96s)]
*  So this is a huge security breach. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=271.76s)]
*  Since Hegseth's personal phone is not at all secure, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=273.88s)]
*  it is likely the target of all kinds of espionage efforts [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=277.76s)]
*  by foreign actors. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=280.5s)]
*  It's also a completely improper dissemination [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  of classified information. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  We learned from NBC News then that the information Hegseth [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  was sending around was basically copied and pasted [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=288.84s)]
*  from messages sent to him on a secure system [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=291.8s)]
*  by the head of CENTCOM. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  So this wasn't like, there's just no debate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  over whether this is classified. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=298.76s)]
*  So we'll get into this staffing chaos in a second. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=299.8s)]
*  But this, I read this Ben and I thought, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=302.48s)]
*  this definitely supports Ben's theory [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  that this guy was just showing off. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=306.32s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=307.68s)]
*  So first of all, let's start there, the temperament, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=309.16s)]
*  what this tells us about the nature [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=311.8s)]
*  of the person who's Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=313.24s)]
*  It's one thing to show off to JD Vance and Mike Waltz [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=315.56s)]
*  and people that would need to know about the- [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=321.4s)]
*  Are in the PDV, but cleared. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=325.4s)]
*  But there's no reason to share this information [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  with your wife and your buddy and your lawyer [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=330.84s)]
*  other than to show off. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=333.48s)]
*  Like, hey, look, here's when the F-18s are taking off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=334.6s)]
*  And that is a window into a person [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=337.52s)]
*  that has some serious problems essentially. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=341.36s)]
*  You know, like you do not want the person [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=344.6s)]
*  who's in charge of the strongest military [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=347.32s)]
*  in the history of the world to like to show off [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=349.36s)]
*  to his buddies or his wife when bombs are gonna drop [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=352.48s)]
*  on people in another country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=356.64s)]
*  Just imagine what that could be like in a real crisis [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=358.28s)]
*  or, you know, God forbid, some war that Trump starts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=361.36s)]
*  So we're getting a window into Pete Hegseth's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=365.52s)]
*  kind of personal demeanor. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=368.24s)]
*  We know he's erratic, we know from reporting [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=370.52s)]
*  that he's had drinking problems, you know, yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=372.6s)]
*  All this paints a picture of someone [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=375.92s)]
*  who is just fundamentally not fit for that job [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=377.48s)]
*  in a kind of dangerous and scary way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=379.36s)]
*  Then there's the question of just the security of this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=381.68s)]
*  And I just kind of want to reiterate for people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=384.8s)]
*  I mean, I had in my house, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=386.92s)]
*  my wife used to call it the command center. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  I had a secure communication set in my house. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  There was this kind of giant cabinet with these phones [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=395.72s)]
*  and encryption wires and made all these weird noises. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  But I had to get on that phone just to talk to anybody [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  about anything that was classified, you know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  These are available to Pete Hegseth. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  Pete Hegseth has a plane that can fly [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=409.24s)]
*  after a nuclear strike on the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's my point. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=413.56s)]
*  No one is better equipped in the world [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  to communicate in a secure fashion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=416.56s)]
*  That's exactly my point is that this guy clearly [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  has secure comms in his home. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=421.12s)]
*  He has secure comms in his car. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  So this is just a guy who wants the capability [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  to just jump on his personal phone, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  which has almost certainly been targeted [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=429.8s)]
*  and quite possibly been compromised, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  given what we know about the Chinese access [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=435.16s)]
*  into JD Vance's phone and Trump's phone during the transition. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you could buy off the shelf Israeli spyware [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=439.8s)]
*  like Pegasus and get it to people's phones. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=442.36s)]
*  Of course the Chinese are doing this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=445.16s)]
*  So that's alarming. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=446.6s)]
*  And look, as things ratchet up with the Chinese, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=448.0s)]
*  maybe if they did have access to that, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=451.16s)]
*  maybe they would pass something to the Houthis. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=453.16s)]
*  It'd be a huge escalation if they did. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  We'll get to that in a minute, yeah, for sure. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=456.8s)]
*  Then the last thing I wanna say is Tommy reminded me [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=458.48s)]
*  of the McChrystal event. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  And so for younger worldos, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=463.0s)]
*  Stan McChrystal was the lead commander of US forces, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=465.88s)]
*  of international forces in Afghanistan. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  While we were in office, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=471.68s)]
*  there was a Rolling Stone article that came out [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=473.2s)]
*  in which he was hanging out with the reporter, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=475.64s)]
*  drinking with his team, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=478.64s)]
*  and kind of just trashing everybody in the administration, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  particularly like Joe Biden and Richard Holbrooke, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=484.4s)]
*  who was at the State Department. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  And Obama ended up firing McChrystal over this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=488.2s)]
*  Now, the reason why he fired him, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=492.52s)]
*  I'll never forget, remember our buddy Doug Lute? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=494.24s)]
*  Doug Lute saying to me, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  look, we liked General McChrystal, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=498.56s)]
*  but he said, look, in the army, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=501.28s)]
*  if a private talked about a captain this way, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=505.08s)]
*  they'd be disciplined, they'd be fired, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=510.2s)]
*  and on up the chain. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=512.16s)]
*  The point is, what message is this sending [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=513.56s)]
*  about things like operational security? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=516.54s)]
*  This actually matters. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=518.84s)]
*  The reason the military is so vigilant [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=520.72s)]
*  about having kind of uniform codes [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=522.4s)]
*  for these types of things is that if the leadership [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=523.96s)]
*  is playing by different set of rules, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  it sends a message down the chain of command [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=530.6s)]
*  to all the mini Pete Hexsets who might be in the military. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=532.84s)]
*  Like, well, I'll send signal messages [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  about what I'm doing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  And so this could filter out through, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=539.0s)]
*  not everybody in the force, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  and I'm not gonna impugn everybody, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=543.4s)]
*  and most people know better, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  but this is not the example you want to set. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=546.12s)]
*  Yeah, Hexsets message is rules for thee, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=548.72s)]
*  but not for me. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=550.84s)]
*  It's kind of the takeaway there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, but it actually gets worse, Ben. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=553.36s)]
*  So Hexsets has just been purging his own staff. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  Last Friday, three top Pentagon officials were fired. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=558.12s)]
*  The official explanation for these firings [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  was that they were associated with a leak investigation [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=562.96s)]
*  that we'll get into in a second, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  but the guys fired were Dan Caldwell, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=566.44s)]
*  a senior advisor to Hexsets, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=569.36s)]
*  Colin Carroll, chief of staff [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=570.78s)]
*  to the deputy defense secretary, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  and Darren Selnick, who was Hexsets deputy chief of staff. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=573.88s)]
*  So the leak investigation [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=579.68s)]
*  that apparently precipitated all of this [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=580.52s)]
*  was started by Hexsets chief of staff, Joe Casper, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=581.92s)]
*  who Politico says is also leaving the job [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=584.76s)]
*  in the coming days [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  for some other kind of nebulous Pentagon position. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=588.3s)]
*  So the leak investigation itself, according to Politico, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=590.6999999999999s)]
*  involved reports about, quote, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=595.56s)]
*  military operational plans for the Panama Canal, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=597.3599999999999s)]
*  a second carrier headed to the Red Sea, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=599.9399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk's controversial visit to the Pentagon, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=602.0s)]
*  and pausing the collection of intelligence to Ukraine. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=604.52s)]
*  The Elon Musk piece of that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=607.52s)]
*  was when he was apparently gonna get briefed [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  on the military plan to go to war with China. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=610.64s)]
*  Take a minute on the Panama Canal. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=613.76s)]
*  I know, I don't really remember that story. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=615.12s)]
*  Yeah, there were no military plans [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=617.36s)]
*  to the Panama Canal when we were there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=620.0s)]
*  So a little worrisome that they're drawing those up. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird one to have in your playbook. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=624.44s)]
*  So after all this came out, Ben, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  and then on Sunday night, Hexsets' former spokesman, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=629.5600000000001s)]
*  like the guy he had tried to hire [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=632.04s)]
*  to be the assistant secretary for public affairs, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=633.4s)]
*  he wrote this bizarre but also very damning Politico op-ed [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=635.4s)]
*  where he talked about being a huge Trump fan, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=638.92s)]
*  a huge Hexsets fan, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=640.98s)]
*  but also said that the Pentagon was in chaos [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=642.32s)]
*  and that Trump deserved better leadership. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  On Monday, NPR reported that the administration [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=646.96s)]
*  was shopping around for a new secretary of defense, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=649.24s)]
*  but the White House and Trump himself [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=651.62s)]
*  quickly shut that down. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  Here's a quick clip of Caroline Levitt, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=655.0s)]
*  the White House press secretary, commenting on this. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=657.36s)]
*  This is what happens when the entire Pentagon [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=659.52s)]
*  is working against you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=662.44s)]
*  and working against the monumental change [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=663.56s)]
*  that you are trying to implement. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=665.76s)]
*  Do you think the entire Pentagon appreciated being [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=667.4799999999999s)]
*  described as working against President Trump? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=670.8s)]
*  I bet that went over really well. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=672.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much that's crazy about this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=673.92s)]
*  I mean, first is these were his guys, as you pointed out. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  These were not deep state guys. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=678.4799999999999s)]
*  These were people that were brought in by Hexset. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  One of these guys worked for Hexset [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=682.42s)]
*  for like a decade. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=684.16s)]
*  One of those astroturf organizations. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=685.0s)]
*  So this guy is so erratic [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=686.3599999999999s)]
*  that even people that have worked with him for years [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  that he hired are like, I'm out after a few weeks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=692.68s)]
*  It sounds like they were pushed out. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=697.84s)]
*  They were like frog marched out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=698.8s)]
*  When people went to their office [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=701.6s)]
*  and they were escorted out by security. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=702.6s)]
*  So it sounds like Pete is so paranoid [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  that he's firing his own buddies of like a year, a decade. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=705.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, who could have foreseen [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=708.24s)]
*  that someone who had a drinking problem [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=709.88s)]
*  and is a weekend Fox and Friends host [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=713.18s)]
*  and has jumped on stage at events [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=714.96s)]
*  and chanted kill Muslims [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=718.12s)]
*  turns out to be not the best personality. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=719.56s)]
*  But then also for the White House to just be standing there [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=722.8s)]
*  and attacking the entire Pentagon [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=726.6s)]
*  as full of people that should be fired. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=728.16s)]
*  These are people that are currently serving in harm's way. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=730.38s)]
*  These are people that have served in uniform for decades. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  Like this is an insane fight [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=736.86s)]
*  that I'm picking. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=738.4s)]
*  Their own appointees. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=739.8s)]
*  So that's not a great sign either. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=740.92s)]
*  And let's be clear, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=743.1999999999999s)]
*  the Pentagon is this massive organization [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=744.08s)]
*  and that front office where he's just had a kind of purge [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=746.1999999999999s)]
*  is the connective tissue between the secretary of defense [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=749.48s)]
*  and the uniformed military, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=753.5200000000001s)]
*  the combatant commands like central command [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=754.36s)]
*  in the Middle East to acquisitions [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=755.74s)]
*  and these massive purchases of military systems, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=758.22s)]
*  managing a trillion dollar budget, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=761.98s)]
*  managing healthcare for millions of people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  Like that front office, if that's in chaos, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  then the whole building can't function. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=770.1800000000001s)]
*  Then the whole building is in chaos. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=771.86s)]
*  You can't get decisions made. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=773.26s)]
*  And so this is not good. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, cause like the Pentagon is not full [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  of a bunch of people who will just kind of [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=779.7800000000001s)]
*  make their best judgment and make decisions without orders. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=781.7s)]
*  They are waiting for orders. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  By definition, there are people that follow orders. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=785.74s)]
*  If it's not flowing down from the secretary [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=787.7s)]
*  to his chief of staff to everybody else. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=789.58s)]
*  And so Trump got Pete Hegseth back. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=790.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course we know in Trump world [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=793.6600000000001s)]
*  that you're in until he decides you're out. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=795.1s)]
*  Clearly though, Hegseth feels like he's fighting [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=798.22s)]
*  for his life. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  He went to battle with the C-SPAN camera [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=801.5s)]
*  next to the Easter bunny and his kids [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=803.62s)]
*  at the Easter egg roll on Monday. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=805.26s)]
*  And then Hegseth went on Fox News Tuesday morning [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=807.82s)]
*  to defend himself. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=810.22s)]
*  Ben, that interview didn't start out great. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=811.68s)]
*  We've got to catch the little slip up here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=814.3599999999999s)]
*  Here to set the record straight himself, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=816.56s)]
*  the current secretary of state, Pete Hegseth. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=819.4799999999999s)]
*  Former secretary, current. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  So he got wrong, the current or the former part. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=823.4799999999999s)]
*  You know why? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=825.64s)]
*  He may be one of the people on the list. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=826.0s)]
*  He might be. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  Because I think Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmade. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=828.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, if Trump is shopping for new secretary, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=830.8s)]
*  he's going to be shopping on Fox and Friends. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=832.88s)]
*  They're pushing him out, yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  They may upgrade from a weekend host to a weekday host too. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=835.8399999999999s)]
*  Honestly, that's a pretty big upgrade. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=838.8399999999999s)]
*  Tough start to the interview for Brian Kilmade. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  But here's the gist of Pete Hegseth's defense of himself. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=842.48s)]
*  I look at war plans every single day. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=846.2s)]
*  What was shared over Signal then and now, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=848.6800000000001s)]
*  however you characterize it, was informal, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=851.44s)]
*  unclassified, coordinations for media coordination [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=854.72s)]
*  and other things. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  That's what I've said from the beginning. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=858.48s)]
*  We take the classification of information very important. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=860.44s)]
*  It's very significant to us that we safeguard it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  And so when we had leaks, which we have had here, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  we did a serious leak investigation. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=870.56s)]
*  And through that leak investigation, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=872.68s)]
*  unfortunately, we found some folks [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=874.16s)]
*  that we believe were not holding to the protocols [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  that we hold dear here at the Defense Department. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=879.92s)]
*  When you dismiss people who you believe [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=882.48s)]
*  are leaking classified information, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=884.36s)]
*  and again, the investigation is ongoing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=885.88s)]
*  and that will take time, and when the evidence produced [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=887.64s)]
*  it will go to DOJ, why would it surprise anybody, Brian, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=890.12s)]
*  if those very same people keep leaking [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=892.92s)]
*  to the very same reporters, whatever information [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=896.12s)]
*  they think they can have to try to sabotage [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=899.16s)]
*  the agenda of the president or the secretary. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=901.92s)]
*  So once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=904.32s)]
*  So one, it's weird that a former Fox Weekend anchor [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=908.48s)]
*  kind of talks like the cat in the hat. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=912.88s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=915.04s)]
*  Tech second, he's screwing his friends over there directly. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=917.36s)]
*  He's being like, these guys are leakers, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=920.12s)]
*  they're still leakers, they're leaking again. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=921.48s)]
*  And to your point about kind of the culture [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=923.08s)]
*  rotting from the head down, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=925.6s)]
*  every single US service member who saw that Atlantic report [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=927.36s)]
*  and saw what he put in those signal chats [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=930.6s)]
*  knows that information is classified, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=933.32s)]
*  and then they're watching their boss go on TV [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=935.36s)]
*  and lie about it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=937.0s)]
*  And basically say there's a different set of rules for him [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=937.84s)]
*  because under classification protocols [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=940.84s)]
*  he should be gone too. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=942.76s)]
*  He should be court-martialed. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=943.76s)]
*  And look, the fish rots from the head, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=946.72s)]
*  I mean, not to put on my MSNBC hat here, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=949.32s)]
*  but when the president of the United States [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=953.92s)]
*  takes classified information down to the John at Mar-a-Lago [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=956.1999999999999s)]
*  like it said in the message. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=960.04s)]
*  That's true, yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=961.16s)]
*  I do wanna just come back to hearing that interview. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=962.36s)]
*  This guy looks like Christian Bale from American Psycho, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  and he sounds completely unhinged. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  And again, almost every Republican, not everyone, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=972.4799999999999s)]
*  almost every Republican Senator voted for this, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=975.56s)]
*  so they own this, right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=977.54s)]
*  These people say that they take American security seriously [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=979.0s)]
*  and the military seriously. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  I want you to consider that person you just heard [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=982.52s)]
*  in a scenario where in the middle of the night, our time, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=985.52s)]
*  the Chinese have launched a multifaceted invasion of Taiwan [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=990.2s)]
*  and he's getting on a call trying to figure out [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  whether to send the Pacific fleet [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=999.84s)]
*  to try to prevent the blockade and amphibious invasion. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1002.36s)]
*  Is that the guy you want in the room [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1006.96s)]
*  making judgment calls about potential? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  How many drinks? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1013.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, three? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1014.8s)]
*  Three or more. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1016.64s)]
*  Best case scenario is he might be passed out [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1017.4799999999999s)]
*  and goes down the chain of command. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1019.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1020.28s)]
*  Because the reality is, even in that interview, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1021.12s)]
*  he's bragging that he looks at war plans every day, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1024.56s)]
*  which by the way, I don't think is true. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1027.26s)]
*  I don't think secretaries of defense sit around. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1029.04s)]
*  He just seems like he's living a fantasy camp [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1031.32s)]
*  with his pocket squares and his war plans [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1034.76s)]
*  and signaling his buddies when the F-15s take off. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1037.08s)]
*  He is so overdressed. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1039.3999999999999s)]
*  And he's just so far over his head [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1040.6s)]
*  that you can't even get your mind around it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1043.52s)]
*  Try getting a reservation at Dorsey and now Paul [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1047.96s)]
*  with that attitude. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1050.76s)]
*  Last thing, Ben, so Tucker Carlson had Dan Caldwell [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1052.0s)]
*  on his show. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1055.68s)]
*  That was one of Pete's, the senior advisor guy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1056.5s)]
*  who was one of Pete's closest friends [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1058.96s)]
*  who'd worked with him for that good. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1060.28s)]
*  I love Tucker's Fox News revenge every now and then. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  Tucker, as always, the conversation, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1066.8s)]
*  whatever Tucker talks to someone in power [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1070.56s)]
*  from the Trump administration, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1072.0s)]
*  it's always about how they have no agency [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1073.56s)]
*  and they're just like victims of the deep state [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1076.32s)]
*  and being sabotaged by the people around them or whatever. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1078.44s)]
*  But Ben, Caldwell had an interesting theory [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1081.36s)]
*  for who is really responsible for the leaks [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1084.96s)]
*  that led to the leak investigation. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1088.4s)]
*  I thought this might interest you. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1090.14s)]
*  As we sit here today, Tucker, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1091.92s)]
*  and this could change by the time this is aired, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1093.8s)]
*  but as we sit here today, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1096.8s)]
*  Susan Rice, Michelle Flournoy, Eric Edelman [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  are still in good standing with the Department of Defense. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1102.28s)]
*  What? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1105.86s)]
*  They are still- Susan Rice? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1106.7s)]
*  Susan Rice. Like the Obama Susan Rice? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1108.24s)]
*  Yes, Susan Rice is still on the Defense Policy Board. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1109.8s)]
*  Right now? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  As we sit here today, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1115.24s)]
*  by the time this is released, that might change. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1116.72s)]
*  But as we sit here today, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1118.84s)]
*  she is still on the Defense Policy Board. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1120.06s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean she can go in the building [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1121.68s)]
*  and get access to whatever she wants, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1123.8s)]
*  but it means that she works with DOD employees, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1125.8s)]
*  she can interact with them, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1128.0s)]
*  and has the credential and the affiliation [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1129.84s)]
*  with the Department of Defense. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1133.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's shocking. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1136.04s)]
*  That is shocking, huh? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1137.2s)]
*  Should we call Susan right now? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1142.68s)]
*  I talked to Susan last week. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1143.68s)]
*  She didn't say she was making [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  emergency inspection visits to the Pentagon. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1146.72s)]
*  Yeah, why didn't she leak us the Panama Canal War Plan? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1148.52s)]
*  Something is telling me that Susan Rice is unlikely. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm sure they just, the Defense Policy, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1154.6000000000001s)]
*  no offense to the Defense Policy Board, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1156.44s)]
*  but this is not like a daily job. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1158.3600000000001s)]
*  They're giving daily intel briefs about it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  My guess is they just haven't gotten to that over at PPO. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1162.5600000000002s)]
*  I just love that Susan Rice has to become the boogeyman [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1165.4s)]
*  in every one of their conspiracies. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  Always, and also this guy, listen, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1169.6000000000001s)]
*  I watched this interview with this dude, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1172.52s)]
*  I kind of felt bad for him because- [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1173.92s)]
*  Wait, wait, you know who else is on this board right now? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  Who else we got? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1177.64s)]
*  Call and Call. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1178.6000000000001s)]
*  Nice, a lot of libs. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1179.44s)]
*  Our buddy, former colleague Dana Smith, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1180.88s)]
*  member of Dana. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1183.12s)]
*  You're helping them do a purge right now. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1183.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1185.28s)]
*  Well, because these people are not going to meetings [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1186.12s)]
*  with Pete Hegsat. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1189.04s)]
*  So this is all a moot point. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1189.8799999999999s)]
*  No, I watched his interview with this guy, Dan Caldwell. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1191.7199999999998s)]
*  It does seem like- [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1193.6s)]
*  Well, this just proves that he's not a deep stater. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1194.4399999999998s)]
*  He's a nut. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1196.8s)]
*  Well, he's a nut. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I came away kind of feeling like he's being targeted [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1198.4799999999998s)]
*  for leaks he probably didn't do, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1202.84s)]
*  and that would suck because you get prosecuted. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1204.56s)]
*  I mean, pretty scary, but then he goes and accuses [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1206.56s)]
*  Susan Rice of doing it, so all my sympathy went away. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1208.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, there is a question. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1211.6799999999998s)]
*  Tucker makes a whole thing about whether Caldwell [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1213.8s)]
*  opposes war with Iran and whether he and others [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1216.0s)]
*  are getting screwed by the traditional hawks. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1219.92s)]
*  It does seem like there is that kind of intra-party battle [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  happening, but I don't know if it's relevant here. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1225.76s)]
*  It doesn't feel relevant here. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1228.1200000000001s)]
*  This feels like chaos emanating out [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  from the personality of Pete Hegsat. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1231.32s)]

*  the current director of the FBI, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1238.0s)]

*  It talks about how Cash Patel keeps just hopping [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  on the FBI private jet to go to MMA events with Trump, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1252.6000000000001s)]
*  which is weird and not normal [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1257.24s)]
*  and not anything a FBI director has done in the past. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1258.64s)]
*  It talks about how Cash Patel had been going to NHL games [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1262.3200000000002s)]
*  and sat next to Wayne Gretzky, one of them, in the box. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1265.2s)]
*  Wayne Gretzky is giving some weird- [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1268.2s)]
*  Gretzky just gets worse the more you learn about him. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1270.04s)]
*  Well, he's having some real political issues in Canada. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1272.16s)]
*  He's a big Trump buddy. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1275.04s)]
*  Yeah, because he's this giant maggot guy. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1275.88s)]
*  Yeah, and he won't just say, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1277.12s)]
*  no, they probably shouldn't annex us. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1278.12s)]
*  It feels pretty simple. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1279.72s)]
*  All your childhood heroes, man. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1282.08s)]
*  I know, it's tough. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1283.4s)]
*  Not that he was mine, but somebody's. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1284.24s)]
*  Guy could see where the puck was going. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1286.2s)]
*  Cash Patel is apparently a member [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1289.68s)]
*  of something called the Poodle Room, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1290.76s)]
*  which is a club at the Font Blu in Las Vegas. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1293.2s)]
*  It says that Cash Patel took three trips on FBI planes [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1296.76s)]
*  to visit his girlfriend in Nashville. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1299.48s)]
*  Glad we're paying for that one. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1301.88s)]
*  And he talked about how he's releasing photos of himself [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  dressed in camo, watching FBI training exercises, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1306.92s)]
*  and how Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1309.64s)]
*  apparently heard himself grappling [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1313.52s)]
*  with some FBI jiu-jitsu instructor down at Quantico. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1315.96s)]
*  The whole story is worth reading, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1319.8s)]
*  but it just does get at how Cash Patel, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1321.44s)]
*  the kind of MAGA FBI director, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1325.0s)]
*  it's just, the role is very different these days, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1327.48s)]
*  and it should be, it makes me very unsettled. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1330.44s)]
*  It should. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1333.68s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that we have generally focused [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1334.52s)]
*  on the harms being done by the Trump administration, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1337.28s)]
*  rightly so, and there are many harms being done. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1340.36s)]
*  But then there's also the question is, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1343.44s)]
*  what is the US government not going to be doing? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1345.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1347.84s)]
*  I mean, Pete Hegseth, Cash Patel, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1348.68s)]
*  what kind of threats, what kind of issues [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1350.56s)]
*  are just going completely undressed [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1353.96s)]
*  because these people are fantasy camping their jobs? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1355.64s)]
*  I mean, the common thread between Hegseth and Patel [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1358.8000000000002s)]
*  is it's like they're just living some childhood fantasy. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  Cash Patel lives in Vegas. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1364.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1366.4s)]
*  He likes to fly around and dress in camo and go to, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1367.24s)]
*  like, can you imagine, I'm not even going to the like, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1371.8000000000002s)]
*  oh, can you imagine Chris Ray in MMA Avengers? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1375.5200000000002s)]
*  But the point is, what is this all about? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1379.44s)]
*  I don't get it, man. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1382.76s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1384.16s)]
*  Speaking of terrible cabinet selections, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1385.24s)]
*  make-a-wish Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1388.96s)]
*  released a plan for a total reorganization [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  of the State Department on Tuesday. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1393.68s)]
*  He did it in a post on Substack. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1395.64s)]
*  Rubio said, quote, I am initiating a broad reorganization [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1397.28s)]
*  of the department to address the steady growth of bureaucracy, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1400.16s)]
*  duplication of functions, and capture by special interests [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1402.84s)]
*  that have crippled American foreign policy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1405.64s)]
*  Ben, I suspect that Rubio releases on Substack [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1407.88s)]
*  because he knows he's going to be pivoting from cabinet [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1410.36s)]
*  secretary to newsletter guy soon. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1412.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's trying to build subscriptions. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1414.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to get some subs. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  Here are some of the key changes he proposed. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1418.48s)]
*  He planned 15% reduction of staff base in the US. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1420.6s)]
*  The department is going to go from 734 offices and bureaus [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1423.6s)]
*  to 602. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  They're going to eliminate the position of the undersecretary [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1427.9599999999998s)]
*  for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1430.56s)]
*  According to Rubio, this position, quote, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1433.28s)]
*  provided a fertile environment for activists [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1435.36s)]
*  to redefine human rights and democracy [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1437.32s)]
*  and to pursue their projects at the taxpayer expense, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1439.48s)]
*  even when they were in direct conflict with the goals [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1442.84s)]
*  of the secretary, the president, and the American people. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1444.96s)]
*  Personally, I was a little more worried about democracy [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1447.8s)]
*  promotion and human rights being used as code for regime change [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1450.1599999999999s)]
*  wars, but you do you, Marco. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1453.36s)]
*  They're going to close the Office of Global Criminal [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1455.84s)]
*  Justice, which advises on issues related to war crimes, crimes [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1458.08s)]
*  against humanity, and genocide. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1461.2s)]
*  Why waste your time on that stuff, right? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1462.96s)]
*  They're going to close the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1465.1599999999999s)]
*  Operation, which works on conflict prevention, crisis [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1467.6399999999999s)]
*  response, stabilization activities, and more. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1470.24s)]
*  And they also took aim at the Bureau of Democracy, Human [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1473.48s)]
*  Rights, and Labor, which he says has become a platform [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1475.68s)]
*  for left-wing activists to go after all [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1478.28s)]
*  of our favorite leaders, like Viktor Orban. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1480.32s)]
*  Never felt like that when we were there. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1482.56s)]
*  No. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1484.0s)]
*  I'll come back to that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1484.24s)]
*  No. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1484.96s)]
*  So Rubio's announcement came after the New York Times [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1485.52s)]
*  reported over the weekend on a draft order that [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1488.56s)]
*  envisioned far more sweeping cuts to the department. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1491.48s)]
*  So in a sense, this is a relief. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1494.72s)]
*  The proposal that was leaked got rid [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1496.84s)]
*  of the Bureau of African Affairs, which seems insane. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1498.32s)]
*  But Ben, just a few thoughts I had in reading this. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1501.56s)]
*  First, obviously, I agree with some of Rubio's criticism. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1503.6s)]
*  There are lots of offices with unclear mandates [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1506.56s)]
*  and overlapping authorities. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1509.6s)]
*  And I don't have enough of a handle [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1511.24s)]
*  on the State Department's current organization [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  to know if this reorg is a good idea. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1516.02s)]
*  But certainly, reforms were a lot of people [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1518.08s)]
*  thought that it could be reformed. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1521.8999999999999s)]
*  Second, though, it seems very dumb to me [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1524.04s)]
*  that they keep making this about cost savings, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1526.16s)]
*  since the State Department budgets, its annual budget [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1528.64s)]
*  is about 6% of what we spend on the military. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1531.0s)]
*  So you're not going to find a lot of savings here. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1533.5600000000002s)]
*  Third, the whole thing is a huge flip flop for Marco Rubio [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1535.5600000000002s)]
*  personally, since he used to talk about projecting [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1538.0800000000002s)]
*  American values around the world. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1539.8000000000002s)]
*  And finally, it just seems so dumb [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1541.44s)]
*  that they seem completely hell bent on retreating from Africa [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1543.16s)]
*  as the Chinese are very openly eating our lunch there, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1546.44s)]
*  and especially when we know that by the end of the century, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  30% of the global population is going [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1552.84s)]
*  to be living on the continent of Africa. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1555.52s)]
*  You feel like you maybe want to invest now. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1557.52s)]
*  But any big takeaways from this treatise from Mr. Rubio? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1559.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm just going to reiterate [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1562.6799999999998s)]
*  that Marco Rubio was the kind of person that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1564.76s)]
*  built his entire political identity on supporting [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1567.32s)]
*  the promotion of democracy abroad. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1571.24s)]
*  That bureau, DRL, Democracy, Rights, and Labor, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1573.28s)]
*  like Cuba money went through there, Cuba democracy money. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1576.48s)]
*  So he was either completely full shit his whole career, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1579.96s)]
*  or he's so callous and self-interested [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1583.68s)]
*  that he's abandoning all of his principles. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1586.04s)]
*  It just bears repeating. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1588.16s)]
*  I think one way to look at this is, yes, the State Department [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1590.6000000000001s)]
*  was kind of right perform. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1594.76s)]
*  This feels like not the most thought out way of doing it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1596.64s)]
*  It does speak to that they have this belief that I've just not [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  ever experienced that the State Department is [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1604.3600000000001s)]
*  full of these ideologues. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1606.3600000000001s)]
*  Just fundamentally was not my experience. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1608.1999999999998s)]
*  These were pretty centrist people. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1611.12s)]
*  But also, if you connect it with what they're doing broadly. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1614.76s)]
*  So just take the democracy piece. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1618.12s)]
*  And look, we can all say, and we've [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  said on this podcast, like regime change, bad democracy [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1623.12s)]
*  in service of regime change. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1627.12s)]
*  But we do a lot of other things. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1628.36s)]
*  So a lot of what the DRL did is kind [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1629.76s)]
*  of advocate for political prisoners, for dissidents. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1632.4799999999998s)]
*  If we were traveling to a certain country, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1636.92s)]
*  here are the cases to raise with those governments, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1638.68s)]
*  the people who are in prison who want to get out of prison. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1641.3200000000002s)]
*  And part of what they're doing that [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1643.92s)]
*  is going to be very consequential is, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1645.92s)]
*  they're cutting all USAID funding. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1648.3600000000001s)]
*  They've now got rid of this department. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1651.24s)]
*  We will no longer take in, clearly, dissidents. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  So we've been a safe haven country for people, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1656.44s)]
*  for refugees and dissidents. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1658.8400000000001s)]
*  And so what happens to all those people out in the world? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1661.24s)]
*  Who is going to be advocating for the release [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1665.32s)]
*  of political prisoners? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1668.2s)]
*  Who is going to be taking in dissidents? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1669.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of rumors in the kind of rumor mill, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1673.84s)]
*  Tommy, that their next target after universities [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1676.08s)]
*  is civil society. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1679.08s)]
*  NGOs. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1680.28s)]
*  NGOs, including potential funding [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1681.12s)]
*  for global civil society. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1682.76s)]
*  And so the American kind of abrupt withdrawal [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1684.6799999999998s)]
*  from being in any way supportive of global civil society, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1688.72s)]
*  even if you think there were some excesses there, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1692.36s)]
*  that was a fraction of, a lot of these people [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1694.24s)]
*  don't even work on political issues. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1696.24s)]
*  They work on environmental issues. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1697.76s)]
*  They work on labor issues. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1699.32s)]
*  They work on the kinds of things that people care about [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1700.76s)]
*  in countries around the world. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1703.04s)]
*  And the United States leaving that space [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1703.88s)]
*  is going to be pretty devastating to the kind of people [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1705.64s)]
*  that we would generally be rooting for around the world. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1708.64s)]
*  Just on your Rubio point, you see Tom Malinowski, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1711.96s)]
*  who once led the Human Rights Bureau, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  pointed out how Rubio would have lost his mind [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1716.88s)]
*  if the US government, if the Obama administration [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1720.2s)]
*  had stopped releasing the annual reports [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1722.52s)]
*  about human rights violations in places like Venezuela [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1724.56s)]
*  or China, and now I think they're just getting rid [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1727.88s)]
*  of the entire function. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1730.44s)]
*  Or things that people on the right say they care about, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1731.68s)]
*  like trafficking persons. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1734.28s)]
*  There's all this other work. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1736.4s)]
*  The conflict piece, stabilization piece, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1737.68s)]
*  the US with USAD is no longer funding peacekeeping missions [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1740.4s)]
*  around the world. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1743.52s)]
*  We talk about all these places where there's a need [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1744.34s)]
*  for some international peacekeeping force. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1747.24s)]
*  With the US getting rid of this part of the State Department, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1749.6s)]
*  getting rid of the USAD, that's going to be compromised. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1751.92s)]
*  I think an important thing to watch, though, Tommy, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1754.24s)]
*  is this is like a one-two punch, right? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1755.8000000000002s)]
*  This is like a sub-stack in an org chart that they put out. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1757.44s)]
*  We won't really know what they're doing [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1760.18s)]
*  until the budget comes out. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1761.7600000000002s)]
*  What do they want to fund at the State Department? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1763.44s)]
*  I'm worried about exchange programs. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1765.42s)]
*  I think international exchange programs are cheap, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1767.4s)]
*  and you get enormous value on them. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1769.64s)]
*  Americans have the experience in context [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1772.5400000000002s)]
*  of being in other countries. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1774.68s)]
*  But importantly, we've educated world leaders, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1775.7800000000002s)]
*  business leaders from around the world in this country [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1777.88s)]
*  through exchange programs. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1779.7600000000002s)]
*  There are things like that that I think could still be cut. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1781.0s)]
*  We may still have a Bureau of African Affairs, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  but it's clearly going to be deprioritized [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  by everything they've done. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1788.76s)]
*  So yeah, this is just a Secretary of State [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1790.24s)]
*  gloating about essentially weakening his own department, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1792.6799999999998s)]
*  and the United States further pulling up the drawbridge [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1795.54s)]
*  from the rest of the world. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1798.36s)]
*  Yeah, and just again, the US military has something [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1799.3999999999999s)]
*  like 2.8 million total employees [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1802.48s)]
*  when it's like active reserve and civilian employees. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1805.82s)]
*  The State Department is something like 80,000, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1809.16s)]
*  and 50,000 of those are being local citizens abroad. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1811.4s)]
*  So it's like 14,000 trained diplomats. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  So again, we're carving down to the bone [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1816.24s)]
*  a relatively lean agency, all things considered. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1818.44s)]
*  And a lot of people left in the first term. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1821.72s)]
*  People are probably going to be fired. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1824.4s)]
*  A lot of people are leaving now. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1826.76s)]
*  The point is the Foreign Service is being decimated, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1829.3600000000001s)]
*  and that is going to take a long time to rebuild. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1832.48s)]
*  And these are specialized people. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1834.52s)]
*  These are people that can speak like six languages, who [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1835.96s)]
*  understand the politics and the culture and niche issues, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1838.56s)]
*  nonproliferation and trade, and are just [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1842.48s)]
*  genuine, brilliant experts in all kinds of things. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1844.96s)]
*  And they do it because they care deeply about the country. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  They're not making a lot of money. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1850.32s)]
*  We know a bunch of these people who [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1851.36s)]
*  could have been making a lot more money than they [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1852.52s)]
*  were in the State Department. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1855.28s)]
*  Yeah, I did forget, though, that Big Balls had gone from Doge [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1856.32s)]
*  over to the State Department. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1859.84s)]
*  So maybe he's leading the show. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1861.0s)]
*  He was a 19-year-old, I think. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1862.8799999999999s)]
*  Big Balls have landed, yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1864.04s)]
*  Big Balls have landed. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1865.2s)]
*  Before we move on, Ben, here's a quick clip [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1866.52s)]
*  of Make-A-Wish Rubio talking about the administration's [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1869.44s)]
*  efforts to cut a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1873.72s)]
*  So we need to determine very quickly now, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1877.6s)]
*  and I'm talking about a matter of days, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1879.36s)]
*  whether or not this is doable over the next few weeks. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1881.24s)]
*  If it is, we're in. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1885.2s)]
*  If it's not, then we have other priorities [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1886.6s)]
*  to focus on as well. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1889.68s)]
*  We're not going to continue to fly all over the world [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1890.92s)]
*  to do meeting after meeting after meeting [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1893.08s)]
*  if no progress is being made. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1895.44s)]
*  So if there's serious about peace on either side or both, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1897.16s)]
*  we want to help. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1899.8400000000001s)]
*  If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1900.76s)]
*  We're going to move on to other topics that are equally [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1903.52s)]
*  and not more important in some ways to the United States. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1905.6000000000001s)]
*  Who is that threat for? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1908.0800000000002s)]
*  The Russians are like, great, move on. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1909.76s)]
*  And the Ukrainians are like, great, stop attacking us [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=1911.76s)]

*  Pope Francis has died at the age of 88. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2233.58s)]
*  The cause of death was acute JD Vance. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2236.38s)]
*  I'm kind of kidding, get a stroke and a heart attack. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2239.6200000000003s)]
*  But JD Vance really was one of the last people [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2240.98s)]
*  to meet with Pope Francis, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2242.82s)]
*  which is kind of mean to Pope Francis. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2244.32s)]
*  It also just kind of defines the cavernous gap [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2247.38s)]
*  between the two individuals in question. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2249.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so Francis went from Jorge Murillo Bregolio, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2252.98s)]
*  the Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2256.6200000000003s)]
*  to Pope Francis in March of 2013. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2258.7000000000003s)]
*  That was after a strong showing in New Hampshire Primary [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2261.42s)]
*  and then a comfort behind when South Carolina, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2263.44s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2265.86s)]
*  So the Pope really did make history. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2266.7000000000003s)]
*  He was the first South American Pope. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2268.98s)]
*  He was one who was not afraid to mix it up [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2271.38s)]
*  on foreign policy. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2273.2200000000003s)]
*  Pope Francis spoke out about climate change. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2274.34s)]
*  He called for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2276.46s)]
*  He called for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2278.92s)]
*  And he would make nightly check-in calls [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2280.38s)]
*  to the Catholic Church in Gaza during the war, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2282.1800000000003s)]
*  just because he's a good guy. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2284.06s)]
*  And then during the Obama administration, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2286.06s)]
*  which I hope you will talk about in detail, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2287.58s)]
*  he supported the Iran nuclear deal [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2289.38s)]
*  and played a key role in negotiations [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2291.2200000000003s)]
*  between the US and Cuba on normalization. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2293.18s)]
*  So the Pope was also clearly not a fan of Donald Trump [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2296.22s)]
*  or his attacks on immigrants and refugees. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2299.66s)]
*  And then generally speaking, Francis, I think, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2302.62s)]
*  tried to model a more decent, humane, humble way [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2304.52s)]
*  of being attributes, which are in short supply these days. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2307.06s)]
*  So Ben, the conservative critics of Pope Francis say [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2310.1s)]
*  he broke too far from traditional conservative doctrine [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2313.06s)]
*  and tradition and focused too much on social justice issues. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  The more liberal critics say that while Francis [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2318.8199999999997s)]
*  had a more moderate, decent tone when talking about, say, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2321.22s)]
*  LGBT people, he didn't make major changes [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2325.3799999999997s)]
*  to the church itself to make it more inclusive. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2328.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think both sides were kind of weirded out by this deal. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2330.9399999999996s)]
*  The church cut with the Chinese government [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2333.58s)]
*  to allow them to have more of a say [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2335.8999999999996s)]
*  in the selection of Catholic priests in China. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2337.74s)]
*  But big picture. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2340.54s)]
*  I was a pretty big fan of the guy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2341.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm not a Catholic. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2343.14s)]
*  I'm not a fan of the Catholic Church as an institution. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2344.1s)]
*  But I just felt for a long time that we got incredibly lucky [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2346.02s)]
*  when he emerged on the world stage after Cardinal Ratzinger, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2349.82s)]
*  Pope Benedict, the one before him, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2353.5s)]
*  because Benedict was not exactly warm and fuzzy. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2355.7000000000003s)]
*  He was more of a doctrine guy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2359.54s)]
*  And then Francis comes along, and he has this, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2361.54s)]
*  he models this approach where he's taking the bus [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2363.94s)]
*  and caring for the poor and caring for the planet [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2366.3s)]
*  and preventing wars. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2369.02s)]
*  And it was just an incredible breath of fresh air. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2369.96s)]
*  But you had actual experience working with this guy. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2372.5s)]
*  What would you make of him? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2374.8s)]
*  I mean, I would say, as a headline, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2376.42s)]
*  he was a moral leader in a world that lacks moral leadership. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2378.62s)]
*  We're living through a time with a huge deficit. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2383.98s)]
*  I was saying to you earlier, Tommy, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2385.94s)]
*  when we were growing up, Nelson Mandela was still around. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2387.58s)]
*  You had the elders. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2389.98s)]
*  You had people like Kofi Annan. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2391.02s)]
*  You had people like Jimmy Carter. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2393.02s)]
*  The kind of people would come into conflict zones. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2394.66s)]
*  They're kind of people that deliver messages [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2396.94s)]
*  that could reach broad audiences. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2398.7799999999997s)]
*  Pope Francis, because of his character [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2400.42s)]
*  and because of his background, he's [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2403.14s)]
*  the first pope from Latin America, Global South, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2404.58s)]
*  an institution in which the populations of Catholics [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2407.62s)]
*  are increasingly in the Global South. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2410.46s)]
*  That was so important to those people [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2412.18s)]
*  to feel represented in that institution. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2414.14s)]
*  And then specifically, he spoke out on climate change. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2417.2999999999997s)]
*  He put out an encyclical, which is the pastoral message [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2422.06s)]
*  that the pope sends, making essentially [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2424.7799999999997s)]
*  kind of a spiritual moral case for fighting climate change. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2426.7799999999997s)]
*  He constantly spoke out on behalf of refugees, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2429.8599999999997s)]
*  including at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2433.1s)]
*  where he really took on some of the political sentiment [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2435.84s)]
*  in Europe to try to welcome refugees. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2438.88s)]
*  And he's sitting there in Italy, too, in Vatican City, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2441.2000000000003s)]
*  and so that mattered there. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2443.6000000000004s)]
*  The Voice for Peace in places like Gaza, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2446.1600000000003s)]
*  where my favorite line that he had is they asked him, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2447.92s)]
*  you call the church every day. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2450.1600000000003s)]
*  What do you say to people there? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2451.2000000000003s)]
*  And he says, I listen, which is another thing [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2452.54s)]
*  that is in short supply. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2454.8s)]
*  My own experience was we went to visit Pope Francis in 2014. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2456.32s)]
*  He was relatively new. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2461.32s)]
*  And I'd been in these secret talks with the Cubans. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2462.84s)]
*  And we knew, like me and Ricardo Zuniga, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2466.2400000000002s)]
*  our friend who was in that negotiating team with me, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2470.52s)]
*  that when you have two parties that don't trust each other, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2473.7200000000003s)]
*  you need a third party to kind of make the commitments to [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2476.04s)]
*  and to have kind of a validator to the deal. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2479.6400000000003s)]
*  And we thought, well, maybe the Vatican could be good. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2482.56s)]
*  So when we went to the Vatican, Obama [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2484.84s)]
*  spent like an hour with Pope Francis. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2487.32s)]
*  And he raised the fact that we were [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2489.84s)]
*  in these secret negotiations with the Cuba. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2493.08s)]
*  This is the first world leader that Obama told [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2494.8s)]
*  that we were doing this with. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2497.08s)]
*  And he said, we will be helpful however we can be. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2498.6000000000004s)]
*  This relationship needs to change. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2502.28s)]
*  I will offer the Vatican in any way we can support you. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2503.88s)]
*  And what was interesting, Tommy, to just show [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2508.6800000000003s)]
*  what kind of figure he was, is obviously [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2511.44s)]
*  he had a lot of respect in the United States. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2513.8s)]
*  And we knew that the validation of Pope Francis [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2515.52s)]
*  would help with Catholic populations in the US. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2517.56s)]
*  The Cubans have a weird history with the Catholic Church. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2520.2799999999997s)]
*  Fidel, not a fan. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2523.48s)]
*  But when I raised this in the negotiations with the Cubans, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2525.92s)]
*  I'll never forget, they kind of looked at each other [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2528.92s)]
*  and said, Papa Francisco? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2530.68s)]
*  Papa Francisco? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2531.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2532.7599999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't him as a leader of the Catholic Church. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2533.36s)]
*  It was him as a social justice committed person [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2536.32s)]
*  from Latin America. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2539.72s)]
*  Right, Jesuit. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2540.64s)]
*  And so it wasn't that the Vatican was playing this role. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2541.44s)]
*  It's that Pope Francis, the person, was playing this role. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2544.36s)]
*  He could be trusted by both Americans and Cubans. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2547.4s)]
*  There are not many people who could do that. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2550.4s)]
*  And we went, after we concluded the negotiation, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2552.04s)]
*  we went to the Vatican. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2555.6800000000003s)]
*  We met with Cardinal Peroline, who's [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2556.88s)]
*  the number two guy there. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2558.92s)]
*  I think he's in the running, but he's [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2560.44s)]
*  coming forth in the New Hampshire polls right now. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2562.36s)]
*  Yeah, his last debate wasn't really good. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2564.4s)]
*  And we had this incredibly powerful multi-hour meeting [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2567.44s)]
*  where we met with the Vatican officials, and the Cubans did. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2570.84s)]
*  And then we all just sit around a table [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2573.92s)]
*  and let it out our commitments. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2575.62s)]
*  Some of these people on the Vatican side [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2577.22s)]
*  were in tears because they had worked in Cuba [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2578.94s)]
*  and knew the suffering of the Cuban people there, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2580.98s)]
*  and the literal blessing of Pope Francis [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2583.94s)]
*  not only built political support in both countries, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2586.74s)]
*  but it kind of lent a moral weight to what we were doing [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2590.86s)]
*  that nobody else could have supplied. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2595.8199999999997s)]
*  And where else can you? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2597.94s)]
*  I'm not a Catholic at all. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2599.66s)]
*  So I'm not saying this is about even the Church itself. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2602.22s)]
*  I'm saying it was about him, you know, right and there are not many places you can go today where you can find that kind of [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2604.62s)]
*  moral leadership Dolly Parton [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2609.54s)]
*  Keanu Reeves [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2611.7s)]
*  Optimist Prime [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2613.62s)]
*  No, I totally agree and also like [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2614.98s)]
*  We look at the essence of the man, right? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2617.9s)]
*  I mean, it's almost cliche to talk about how we would you know, wash the feed of yeah [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2619.8199999999997s)]
*  The sick or ride the bus in Argentina if you go to the Vatican if you go to St. Peter's Basilica [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2623.5s)]
*  Something really it's not particularly humble, you know, like the takeaway for me was like power [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2629.42s)]
*  Money, yeah wealth like you know, that's sort of the feeling I got he was just the his approach [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2634.36s)]
*  In his public persona was entirely different when I remember when we were walking in to the complex for those meetings [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2639.92s)]
*  And there was this really nice Irish priest walking us in and and and and the previous Pope Benedict [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2646.8s)]
*  Ratzinger had you know, he had the Prada shoes or whatever. Yeah, and he pointed to this very simple apartment [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2653.8s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that's where Pope Francis, you know [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2659.7200000000003s)]
*  Moved in it was literally like a door, you know [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2665.3199999999997s)]
*  And so he modeled humility and the last thing I'd say I'm not an expert in Vatican reforms [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2665.68s)]
*  That is a tough fucking institution right arm. So 12 years is not a long time to kind of turn around the ocean liner [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2670.68s)]
*  I will say you know, he appointed a lot of Cardinals from that's right the global south from [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2676.48s)]
*  Conflict zones and so it'll be interesting to watch, you know his election [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2683.04s)]
*  As we've learned you can work for a progressive and if the next guy's not progressive your [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2688.48s)]
*  But if that [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2694.16s)]
*  Reconstruction of the Cardinals leads to a Francis like Pope [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  This could we could look back and say hey Pope Francis was the guy who turned this thing around [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2701.4s)]
*  The I don't know if you heard the daily today on this they pointed out that so there's 135 Cardinals eligible to vote [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2705.52s)]
*  Francis elevated 108 of them so 80% of the people voting. Yeah, so they owe their jobs to [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2712.2400000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, this is like in Dorsen early in Iowa. Hopefully he'll get some you know [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2718.44s)]
*  It's something that'll follow in his shoes, but it does speak to what your Biden's not running [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2724.0s)]
*  It does speaks to the point you're making which is like there's only so much you can achieve during your tenure [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2730.28s)]
*  But it could be that he set the stage. Yes for more dramatic changes and by pointing all these institutions [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2735.68s)]
*  That is like literally seen as the heart of the West [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2741.28s)]
*  The you know justification of Empire [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2744.44s)]
*  Will become a global South institution. Yeah, so, you know the other metric he's judged by [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2747.12s)]
*  Just just to be fair is whether or not he succeeded in growing the church [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2752.68s)]
*  It doesn't seem like he was successful there in 2023 about 20% of Americans identified as Roman Catholic [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2755.72s)]
*  That's down from 25% in 2008 [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2761.2s)]
*  I think Catholic membership in Latin America dropped seven or eight points during his tenure this according to I think political or axios [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2763.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, interestingly Ben [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2770.2s)]
*  Francis never visited Argentina during his 12 years [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2772.2s)]
*  During his 12 years as Pope even though he visited like 68 countries and basically all of Argentina's neighbors [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2775.8s)]
*  So he never went back to his home country, which rubbed a lot of people there the wrong way [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2782.1200000000003s)]
*  It's not totally clear why it's likely that he didn't want to get pulled into Argentinian politics and be used as a prop by whichever [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2786.36s)]
*  President kind of scored the visit obviously half your me like yeah. Yeah, we've talked about openly attacked him and called him an imbecile [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2793.2000000000003s)]
*  During his campaign, so not gonna go see that guy [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2799.96s)]
*  But also [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2802.64s)]
*  Francis was criticized by some for not doing enough to stand up to the military junta in Argentina during the 70s and early 80s [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2803.8799999999997s)]
*  There's allegations that [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2810.7599999999998s)]
*  Francis or maybe others in the Catholic Church in Argentina either turned a blind eye to some of the worst abuses like torture or the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2812.7999999999997s)]
*  Stealing of children from people that were executed by the regime or that they collaborated [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2820.68s)]
*  Francis would never was never formally accused of collaboration. There's no known evidence, but you know that [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2825.72s)]
*  20 30,000 people were like just disappeared during the dirty wars. So I think there's a lot of [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2831.76s)]
*  Understandable like lingering anger and resentment and anyone who didn't stop it. Yeah. No, I mean that [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2836.84s)]
*  very complicated history for the Catholic Church [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2842.4s)]
*  And a lot of those dictatorships I one thing I'd say is it is interesting that the Christian demographics [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2845.96s)]
*  You see this in like a place like Brazil this kind of growing evangelical movement. Yeah, the Catholics have been losing [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2851.48s)]
*  Some people in that direction which those people become the kind of Bolsonaro supporters [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2858.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's interesting to tend to watch [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2864.2799999999997s)]
*  I the last thing I just say is that the Catholic Church in this country is like to his right, right? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2866.64s)]
*  The most extreme so maybe the one of the reasons why they're having problems with membership [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2871.72s)]
*  Is that they're the ones who seem to be hung up on sex and you know [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2874.6s)]
*  LGBT issues abortion and stuff in a way that Francis didn't seem to be like [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2878.12s)]
*  Our country as usual is not exactly moving in the right direction. No, we are [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2882.04s)]
*  Swinging back the wrong way. So last thing on this so the in terms of next steps [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2887.8799999999997s)]
*  So 15 or 20 days after the death of the Pope the Cardinals entered the Sistine Chapel and they're sealed off from the outside world [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2892.0s)]
*  Until they pick a new pope in college, Ben, we call that a lock-in. Yeah, there's more about you know [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2898.4399999999996s)]
*  30 racks of Natty light and anyway, so all Cardinals under 80 get to vote. Do you think they do that the conclave? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2903.3599999999997s)]
*  There's shotgun and beers [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2911.68s)]
*  How funny would that be if you walked in you got a window in it? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2913.6s)]
*  So if you're under 80 you get to vote again funny [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2915.88s)]
*  There's one vote the first day then up to four votes every day after you need a two-thirds majority to be elected the new pope [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2919.7200000000003s)]
*  Black smoke comes out of the chimney. That means there's no news white smoke means we got a new pope [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2926.52s)]
*  Apparently they get some they add some chemicals to the paper that they burn the ballots [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2931.36s)]
*  But they add some chemicals to get that white color [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2935.04s)]
*  Then the Pope will speak from st [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2937.12s)]
*  Peter's Basilica afterwards and if you talk about what happens during the conclave you can get ex communicated for it [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2938.88s)]
*  Even if you use signal, so just heads up to everybody [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2945.16s)]
*  Technically you can pick anyone any baptized Roman Catholic male [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2948.8799999999997s)]
*  But it's been all Cardinals who have been elected Pope since 1378. So I guess you know, I don't have a chance but Biden does you're right [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2954.12s)]
*  Is there an age [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2962.72s)]
*  80 years old I thought you said well you you can vote if you're under 80. Okay. Okay, but I don't know if you can get [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2964.24s)]
*  The gig. Yeah might be a brief. Did you see conclave? I've not but everyone says I have [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2969.48s)]
*  The end is you know, let's just say the end is questionable whether it's in line with those results, okay [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2974.56s)]
*  Interesting. I'll have to watch that. Okay [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2981.8s)]
*  Let's turn to our own little mess over here Ben is the global trade war folks probably watching the stock market go up and then [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2983.88s)]
*  Down and then all over the place and it's because it's a stupid self-inflicted global trade war that has not ended [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2990.52s)]
*  So earlier today the International Monetary Fund or IMF announced that thanks to the Trump tariffs [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=2996.34s)]
*  The global growth rate this year will only be 2.8 percent [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3001.48s)]
*  Which is down a half point from their projection that they released in January and below historical averages [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3005.0s)]
*  So good one there and again because Trump's policy is stupid [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3010.92s)]
*  The slowdown is gonna hit the US economy harder than most other places [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3015.8s)]
*  The IMF says their US growth estimate is a third lower than it was in January and a full point below last year [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3020.2400000000002s)]
*  China is gonna take a hit too, but a much smaller one proportionally than we do [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3025.7s)]
*  So again, none of this makes sense [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3029.56s)]
*  Two weeks ago Trump announced this 90-day pause and what they had described as reciprocal tariffs on basically every country except China [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3031.12s)]
*  The White House wants us to believe that they're going to be able to negotiate dozens of new trade agreements before that 90-day deadline is up [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3037.46s)]
*  So the tariffs will go back into place. You should not believe them. The Wall Street Journal says [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3043.88s)]
*  Where they reported that Trump's strategy might be to get commitments [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3048.48s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's strategy is to get commitments from US trading partners to isolate the Chinese economy in exchange for the US [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3052.54s)]
*  Getting rid of our own tariffs and trade barriers [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3059.2s)]
*  But the Chinese are openly warning other countries not to play that game [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3061.3999999999996s)]
*  issuing statements like once international trade returns to the law of the jungle [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3065.3999999999996s)]
*  We're the strong prey on the weak all nations will be victims [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3069.2799999999997s)]
*  Pretty good quote. Yeah, they got some good writers there. I [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3073.3999999999996s)]
*  Look I think that the [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3077.7999999999997s)]
*  The part of this I want to focus on is the China one because look what's so dumb about this Trump thing is [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3080.9199999999996s)]
*  They'll get a couple like news cycle things, you know, like somebody agreed to this and they'll act like they won some big win [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3087.76s)]
*  They've already lost the trade war to China. That's my hot take here [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3093.2s)]
*  Which is that the Chinese have been preparing for this since Trump's first term. They've been methodically [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3099.32s)]
*  Like remaking their own economy and actually some analysts are like what are the Chinese doing? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3106.08s)]
*  Their growth is down or they're not rescuing their own housing market [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3111.2400000000002s)]
*  What they were doing is that methodically making themselves a hub for certain sectors and in for certain trade relationships [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3114.06s)]
*  So for instance, they are a leader in clean energy, right? And so they produce massive amounts of solar panels [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3121.5s)]
*  EVs, but it's not just that they dominate all these supply chains for [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3131.06s)]
*  Clean energy whether it's kind of the rare earth materials that we're always talking about or whether it's component parts [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3137.06s)]
*  And so if you're Europe if you're somebody that wants to be plugged in to the clean energy economy [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3142.46s)]
*  You're gonna you're gonna choose China over the absolutely over Tesla. Yeah [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3149.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think so like over some fucking lunatic whose truth socialing his trade policy [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3153.1800000000003s)]
*  You're gonna go in that direction, right and the Chinese know that and and these are US allies Europe Japan South Korea [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3157.86s)]
*  That that that get this and they're not gonna listen to Trump talking about liquid gold of American fossil fuels [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3164.1800000000003s)]
*  They're gonna want to be plugged into the Chinese clean energy [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3170.22s)]
*  Ecosystem AI where are you gonna want to buy your AI from? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3173.2599999999998s)]
*  like, you know the the Chinese who are like [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3177.14s)]
*  Selling it cheaper for uses in areas like robotics and manufacturing that developing countries want or like the Americans who could like throw a [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3180.3799999999997s)]
*  tariff on you tomorrow [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3188.2599999999998s)]
*  We the Canadians I mean in you know, our tickets going in the Chinese are now buying they're not buying their energy from us [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3190.18s)]
*  They're signing LNG deals [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3197.26s)]
*  liquid natural glass from the Chinese from the Canadians and [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3199.7000000000003s)]
*  We could actually succeed what Trump is succeeding in doing is not only in is there the low-hanging fruit [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3203.5800000000004s)]
*  The Chinese have invested a lot more in Africa and Southeast Asia than we have [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3208.7000000000003s)]
*  They're already ahead of us there and what Trump's doing is pushing those countries closer to China. I'm talking about Canada Europe [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3212.1400000000003s)]
*  Japan South Korea the countries that we would assume would usually be on our team [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3218.26s)]
*  Sure, they may announce some new cycle things for Trump [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3222.34s)]
*  But I think the Chinese have this thing wired so that over time they're repositioning themselves as a center of [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3224.9s)]
*  Key sectors clean energy artificial intelligence obviously and a lot of manufacturing and they're the more predictable partner [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3232.1s)]
*  We're not gonna we may do some crappy things [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3238.58s)]
*  We may subsidize our industries in ways that give us a competitive advantage [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3241.06s)]
*  We may steal your intellectual property, but at least you know the deal with us. Where was it Trump? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3244.78s)]
*  I'll tell you I talked to some people other countries Tommy and this is not a surprise [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3249.6600000000003s)]
*  Nobody knows what these Trump people are asking for no and I've talked to people in multiple regions who literally are like we don't even know [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3253.38s)]
*  What they are asking us for because they don't know right the Chinese have been playing this for like a decade and Trump [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3260.06s)]
*  They're planning it day by day [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3267.02s)]
*  Who do you think is gonna win that trade war and we were just getting it to a point where a lot of countries were getting [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3268.7000000000003s)]
*  frustrated with [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3273.86s)]
*  Unfair Chinese trading practices dumping steel etc etc, but now they're all pissed at us and to your point Ben [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3275.06s)]
*  I mean Xi Jinping has been hitting the road. He visited Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3280.86s)]
*  And all those places he was met by the president or the king or the prime minister, right? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3286.6200000000003s)]
*  Like they're excited to see him and the Chinese are they're squeezing US businesses [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3290.7400000000002s)]
*  Like you mentioned not just with terrorists [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3295.02s)]
*  But with other means so China suspended the import of poultry from these specific American farms after suddenly finding a new health concern [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3297.02s)]
*  That they hadn't had for decades in March [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3304.1800000000003s)]
*  They've refused to renew the registration required for US companies to export beef to China [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3307.06s)]
*  So all of that's on hold billions of dollars worth of commerce [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3311.2599999999998s)]
*  They stopped buying LNG like you mentioned and then China's minister [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3314.46s)]
*  Minister of Agriculture had a meeting with his counterpart in Brazil to discuss whether Brazil could replace the [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3318.7799999999997s)]
*  12.8 billion dollars worth of soybeans that the US sells the China Chinese per year. It's like you said this is like a [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3324.7s)]
*  methodical targeted strategy and meanwhile, I think [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3331.94s)]
*  US consumers are just unaware of how badly this could hurt us in what weird ways and for how long yeah [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3335.5s)]
*  So Derek Thompson great reporter at the Atlantic. He mr. Abundance. Mr. Abundance himself pointed how rough this could be for parents [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3342.02s)]
*  so for example [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3350.18s)]
*  99% of child safety seats come from China [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3351.9s)]
*  96% of toys for pets 95% of cooking appliances 93% of coloring books for kids 88% of microwave ovens [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3355.3s)]
*  70 plus percent of toys intended for children under 12. It's all coming for China [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3362.7799999999997s)]
*  so to your point I'd like it's easy to get bogged down in these specifics, but I do think that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3367.62s)]
*  the media Wall Street [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3372.46s)]
*  Political figures no one is like adequately reckoning with or explaining to the American people that Trump may have set in motion a [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3374.8599999999997s)]
*  Reordering of the global economy that actually may be irreversible [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3382.22s)]
*  irreversibly to the favor of China and you know again who would you bet on like I I'm not a [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3386.02s)]
*  Fan of the Chinese Communist Party not a communist [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3392.22s)]
*  But what those guys do is they plan [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3395.74s)]
*  And they've been sitting over there with people like and they've been undergoing this economic transformation for years to plan for this [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3398.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you think those guys have a plan or do you think Howard Lutnick? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3407.14s)]
*  Who's going on TV and yelling about one interview? We're gonna be building iPhones here in the next [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3411.2999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna have robots building iPhones, but we're gonna build the factories where the robots are and Peter Navarro [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3416.8199999999997s)]
*  fucking prison [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3422.18s)]
*  Over the January 6 like like who do you think has a better plan Peter Navarro and Howard Lutnick or the planning committee over in China? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3423.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the other thing I just want to say is [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3431.22s)]
*  The Chinese have also been working for years to sanctions proof their economy. They saw what we did to Russia [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3433.46s)]
*  They they don't want that to happen to them [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3438.74s)]
*  We are massively accelerating this decoupling of the US and China [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3440.74s)]
*  This is going to make it much easier for them if they want to invade Taiwan [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3445.22s)]
*  Because the reason that they couldn't think about doing that ten years ago is if we drop the hammer on them economically with sanctions [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3450.06s)]
*  And we brought along, you know some European and Asian countries in those sanctions [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3457.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, you know that could absolutely bring the Chinese economy to its knees [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3462.58s)]
*  we are doing them the favor of essentially making it so that we have no economic leverage over them to not invade Taiwan and [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3466.3799999999997s)]
*  Guaranteeing that other countries are gonna be more likely to look the other way if and when they invade Taiwan [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3474.58s)]
*  So another thing to mark back to this moment is if you see that happen in a few years [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3479.86s)]
*  Trump will have just made it much much easier for that to happen [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3485.62s)]
*  Wonderful in which case the Chinese will control all 80 the 80% plus of the advanced semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3489.46s)]
*  Yeah, especially after a job Donald Trump. You're really sticking it to the Chinese communists [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3496.46s)]

*  So we can go real long today [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3708.5s)]
*  So we noticed that during his defensive Pete Hexeth Trump said once you ask the Houthis how Pete is doing [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3709.74s)]
*  So we're gonna do that we're gonna check in on things in Yemen [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3716.08s)]
*  So on Thursday the US targeted a port in the Houthi controlled province of Hodea [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3718.18s)]
*  This port of the Red Sea is a crucial access point for fuel and fuel import taxes for the Houthis [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3722.46s)]
*  The Houthi run health ministry said that at least 80 people were killed in the attack and almost 200 were wounded in the UN said [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3727.52s)]
*  The port infrastructure was severely damaged and oil is now leaking into the Red Sea on Sunday [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3733.18s)]
*  More US airstrikes hit a neighborhood in Yemen's capital Sanaa killing 12 more people and injuring 30 [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3738.04s)]
*  Tired to get good information then about the efficacy of these strikes [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3744.02s)]
*  But on the most important metric whether the Houthis have stopped firing shit at ships in the Red Sea [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3749.2599999999998s)]
*  It has failed so far and Fox News is Jennifer Griffin reported that [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3754.94s)]
*  Six MQ 9 Reaper drones have been shot down by the Houthi since March 3rd [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3758.8999999999996s)]
*  Five of them since Trump began his strikes on March 15. So these things cost 30 million a pop [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3764.18s)]
*  So they're they're they're shooting back at us and pretty effectively [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3769.2s)]
*  The Houthis are also launching missiles at Israel including last week in the reportedly building closer ties with China and Russia [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3772.1800000000003s)]
*  So the State Department said that a Chinese company with ties to the People's Liberation Army [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3778.7400000000002s)]
*  Was quote directly supporting Iran backed Houthi terrorist attacks on US interests by giving the Houthis intelligence [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3783.0600000000004s)]
*  The US had previously sanctioned that same company in 2023 for reportedly giving satellite imagery to the Wagner group [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3789.5s)]
*  So these sound like a bunch of fucking assholes the Wall Street Journal also reported that last summer Yemen intercepted [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3796.44s)]
*  A shipment of Chinese made weapons tech that could increase the range of Houthi drones and make them harder to spot [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3801.98s)]
*  So that partnership is clearly deepening this piece also pointed out that some Houthis have been sanctioned by the US for doing arms deals [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3807.3s)]
*  with Russians including buying 10 million dollars worth of weapons from Victor bout [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3814.1200000000003s)]
*  The known arms dealer and then the Russian military is also apparently advised the Houthis and provided targeting data to attack Western ships [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3819.1800000000003s)]
*  so [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3826.7400000000002s)]
*  There's also all this talk about a potential ground operation in Yemen where you might have some Yemeni militias trying to capture this major port city [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3828.1s)]
*  So what we're trying to get out here is things are not better. The problem is not solved. Things are escalating [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3835.14s)]
*  There's talk of a ground operation. So I don't know that [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3840.46s)]
*  Pete Hegseth's report card out of Yemen from the Houthis is actually all that good. No and [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3843.62s)]
*  There's [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3851.5s)]
*  Layers of what's fucked up about this. I mean first of all they can't articulate what they're doing [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3852.66s)]
*  You know, I mean real make-wish Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, you know, they're gonna restore shipping or something [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3857.34s)]
*  Well, guess who doesn't believe that the shipping companies right and even if they restored for time [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3864.9s)]
*  The Houthis will be back and like this is not gonna work [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3869.38s)]
*  They can't it this is for Trump who said he was gonna end forever words. He's repeating all the mistakes some which were made by Obama [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3872.42s)]
*  Most of which were made by Bush some which are made by Biden of launching a military effort with no [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3880.34s)]
*  Defineable or achievable end state other than just bombing some stuff [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3887.18s)]
*  And that that's morally problematic. It's strategically problematic because it also [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3891.74s)]
*  Ignores the reality that they're incentivizing the Chinese, you know [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3897.58s)]
*  If you're gonna try to launch this existential trade war the Chinese like what incentive do they have to not? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3901.9199999999996s)]
*  You know start helping these guys under the table [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3909.06s)]
*  These morons in the White House who talk about literally talk openly about with like all-in podcast listeners [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3911.18s)]
*  Talking about how we're gonna peel the Russians away from the Chinese [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3918.08s)]
*  The Russians are wholly dependent on the Chinese for their economy. That's how they busted our sanctions. That's where they get their technology [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3920.58s)]
*  That's where they get all their shit. So the Russians have no incentive to to cooperate with us against the Houthis [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3927.02s)]
*  Putin thinks he's gonna be there after Trump, right? And so he's gonna go the same way [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3933.86s)]
*  The event the opportunity for Putin is not to like peel away from China and some all-in podcast, you know 3d [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3938.18s)]
*  Chana move it's to say this is my chance to beat the West [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3945.3399999999997s)]
*  This is my chance to beat the Americans and this is the kind of shit that we have to watch [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3949.5s)]
*  Because you're looking at this and you're the Russians you're the Chinese and certainly the Houthis and you got you know [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3953.98s)]
*  Pete Hegstapp signaling his wife about f-18 attacks and Peter Navarro launching trade wars. It's like look at them [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3958.12s)]
*  They're on the ropes in the US like this is this is not the time to like capitulate these guys [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3963.96s)]
*  This is the time to hit them pressure advantage to two more updates out of Israel before we wrap [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3968.44s)]
*  So first we have talked about [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3973.5s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu trying to fire Ronan Barr the head of the shin that the Israelis Israel's domestic intelligence service [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3976.16s)]
*  Last night there was this crazy report where Ronan Barr said in an affidavit that he was pressured by Netanyahu [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3982.96s)]
*  To spy on Israelis who organized protests that were critical of the Israeli government and the Netanyahu [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3989.7999999999997s)]
*  Demanded that Ronan Barr be loyal to him over rulings made by the Israeli Supreme Court [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=3995.96s)]
*  Barr says things went south between [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4003.08s)]
*  He and Netanyahu after Barr started investigating that Yahoo's aids for leaking classified information and for their ties to Qatar [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4005.16s)]
*  Also for rejecting a demand that Netanyahu reportedly made that Barr signed some sort of document that would have prevented Netanyahu [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4011.96s)]
*  Corruption trial from going ahead based on some specious [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4019.52s)]
*  Security argument that I guess Netanyahu manufactured so Ben I read this [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4023.56s)]
*  Reaction was similar to yours, which was like I really go up and down over who was the worst leader [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4027.92s)]
*  Is real or us, you know on any given day it could be one or the other. I don't know pretty tight competition [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4032.4s)]
*  you know neck and neck is neck and neck, I mean [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  This just [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4042.48s)]
*  Bebe's for all the people here who think he's got some grand strategy [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4043.84s)]
*  This guy is basically just relentlessly about his own political survival flailing. He will take Israeli [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4047.4s)]
*  Democracy down with him. He will obviously take the entire Palestinian people down with him [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4054.1200000000003s)]
*  He will take regional he's messing around Syria's messed around Lebanon [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4058.2400000000002s)]
*  He wants to bomb Iran like this its date BB Netanyahu is [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4061.8s)]
*  Imperative to stay in power to avoid prison is really dangerous. I think that's you know this like everything else reinforces [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4066.48s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of which [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4073.1s)]
*  After a brief reprieve during the ceasefire for about two months things in Gaza are just beyond awful again [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4075.14s)]
*  So the IDF is just back to bombing the shit out of the place on Saturday [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4081.8199999999997s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry said IDF airstrikes killed 90 people in 48 hours [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4086.42s)]
*  We are once again seeing videos on social media of Gazans burning alive [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4091.18s)]
*  after some of these strikes because all of them are now 90% of the population is displaced and they're all living in tents and [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4096.66s)]
*  The Israeli military is now occupying and are holding about half of the Gaza Strip and saying they plan to occupy it indefinitely [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4102.54s)]
*  And there are there are still some like ceasefire proposals being discussed [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4108.42s)]
*  there's one from Qatar and Egypt that would entail like a five to seven year truce and [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4113.46s)]
*  Hostage and hostage and prison releases and then the complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4117.74s)]
*  But there's just no reason to believe that Netanyahu would go for any of that [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4121.5199999999995s)]
*  also been a couple weeks ago, we talked about this awful incident where [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4126.78s)]
*  15 Palestinian aid workers in clearly marked emergency vehicles were gunned down by Israeli troops [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4130.139999999999s)]
*  Initially the IDF claimed that they were terrorists and the vehicle didn't have flashing lights on [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4136.98s)]
*  That was then proven to be just complete and total bullshit when investigators found a video on the cell phone of one of the executed [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4141.82s)]
*  medics that [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4149.7s)]
*  Documented the entire thing and had his final, you know [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4151.46s)]
*  His family and his final prayers and just horrifying stuff [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4154.42s)]
*  So the but despite this like cut-and-dry evidence for this being a war crime [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4158.18s)]
*  The only accountability we've heard of is like tepid statement of regret by the IDF and I think they fired one commander and reprimanded another [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4165.06s)]
*  But like no one's getting prosecuted. Yeah, those guys will pop up again somewhere else. I mean, I mean [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4172.96s)]
*  There there's just words fail because you essentially have like a stated policy of ethnic cleansing, you know [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4179.3s)]
*  They're gonna basically depopulate Rafa the southern Gaza as we've talked about they're not letting food in they're not letting aid in [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4186.22s)]
*  They're bragging about it. They're pushing people onto an enclave against the [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4193.38s)]
*  Like against the water like this is really horrific [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4197.860000000001s)]
*  I one thing to watch will you know Trump has this trip in mid-may to the Middle East and [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4200.5s)]
*  I'm sure that they want to revise the old Saudi normalization talks, you know and have some announcement and [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4206.46s)]
*  And they can't get Saudi normalization without a ceasefire [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4214.38s)]
*  And so to me the only pathway back to a ceasefire [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4217.0599999999995s)]
*  And just the people in Gaza being allowed to stay there and live their lives is some [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4220.86s)]
*  regional play but I [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4227.54s)]
*  Don't know. It just doesn't feel good right now and God help these hostages that are still there [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4229.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're just the only way they're getting out of through a deal. Yeah, anyone who suggests otherwise, it's just yeah [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4233.8s)]
*  I don't yeah, I willfully what is this doing to get the hostages? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9vDFmVHGE&t=4238.6s)]
