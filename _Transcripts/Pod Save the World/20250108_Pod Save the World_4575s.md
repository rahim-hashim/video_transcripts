Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation, South Korea’s growing political crisis after President Yoon Suk Yeol barricaded himself in his home and refused arrest, and why we should take seriously Donald Trump’s threats to use “military or economic coercion” to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. They also talk about why Elon Musk is boosting far-right parties in Germany, Canada and the UK, the Biden administration’s determination that the RSF rebel group has committed genocide in Sudan, and Biden’s partial relaxation of sanctions on Syria and 11th-hour effort to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

# Are Trump's Threats to Take Greenland and the Panama Canal Serious?
**Pod Save the World:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. Man, that's a long break [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=0.0s)]
*  Huh? It's a long break. It's nice. I think this is on like Wednesdays or something [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=5.68s)]
*  I haven't gone this long without podcasting in many years. Yeah me either. It was really nice [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=9.32s)]
*  We had a great time with family by the end [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=13.72s)]
*  I needed to get out of the house and my wife needed me to get out of the house [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=15.82s)]
*  I think and I was like, please leave we had like a lot of activities. We didn't have kids in the holidays [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=18.92s)]
*  There's like ice skating and there's parties and there's you know, just stuff [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=24.12s)]
*  So I was pretty one of those breaks where I was more exhausted at the end than recharged [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=28.82s)]
*  But it was same same. We also had a couple of kind of rolling colds and flu [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=33.58s)]
*  It's a little harder to do activities with the eight month olds [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=37.7s)]
*  But very fun to have my daughter learn about Santa for the first time [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  We had some Santa issues this year. Oh, no, I mean basically they're pretending to believe in Santa [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=44.3s)]
*  I think you know, so there but there were a lot of because they're pretending they know how to ask questions that you know [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=49.14s)]
*  Be uncomfortable answering. Mm-hmm. You know, well, why is Santa's this presents from Santa? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=54.3s)]
*  Why does it say was made by this toy company in Minnesota? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=58.54s)]
*  Yeah, they just start fucking with you Lizzy's in the exact opposite phase. She's too so we're like at the airport [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  She sees a Santa doll random like bookstores. It's like Santa. Yeah. Yes. That is Santa also [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=68.46s)]
*  You cannot buy the corona water bottle. No, no, no, no, no really wanted don't need that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  But a lot of things happened then it was very very hard to figure out what to put in the show today [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=79.94s)]
*  Mm-hmm things were not gonna talk about the horrific ISIS attack in New Orleans [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=84.41999999999999s)]
*  yes, or the other lunatic who loaded up a cyber truck with a bunch of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=88.36s)]
*  Explosive material and parked in front of a Trump hotel. Yeah as you and I talked about we'll probably be circling back to these stories [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=94.02s)]
*  Because they have some common threads [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=99.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=101.22s)]
*  we need to circle back to those obviously the rise of ISIS is scary the common thread of these guys being veterans and rise of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=101.46s)]
*  Extremism and these private militia groups that feel sort of ascendant after Trump's reelection [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=107.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my only comment on this would be the ISIS thing doesn't feel foreign directed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  It feels like this guy was inspired [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  But if that had happened in the Obama we Obama gave a address to the XI know cuz I had to write it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=117.5s)]
*  He gave an address to the nation in prime time over the San Bernardino attack shooting if you remember [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=123.38s)]
*  Which did not was not as destructive as this one. It just shows how much [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=129.22s)]
*  terrorism no longer [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=133.78s)]
*  You know, I don't know so many other crazy things have happened that that doesn't seem it quite as alarming to people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=135.5s)]
*  I don't know a lot of other risks out there. Well, we got a great show for you today [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=141.1s)]
*  We are gonna talk about a major leadership change in Canada this ongoing saga in South Korea nuts [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=144.66s)]
*  impeachment turned into arrest attempts to it's one of the most [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=151.98s)]
*  Shocking leadership crises as I've seen in a long time [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=156.66s)]
*  We're also gonna do a long Trump section because he was spouting off over the break [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=158.94s)]
*  Yeah, talking about Greenland talking about the Panama Canal [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=162.62s)]
*  We got Elon Musk kind of banging about in a whole bunch of different countries foreign affairs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna get into that. I will also talk about some major steps Biden took on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=170.78s)]
*  Sudan some steps he took on Syria and Guantanamo Bay and then close it out with some fun stuff. So heavy show [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=175.26s)]
*  Excited to talk it through with you. Let's start want to start with Canada. Yeah, I got Justin Trudeau [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=182.78s)]
*  So not the 51st state yet. Not the 51st state yet. I do think is the operative term just kidding Canadian friends [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=187.02s)]
*  On Monday Justin Trudeau announced he's stepping down as Prime Minister of Canada in the leader of the Liberal Party [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=192.98s)]
*  So this ends Trudeau's nine years as Prime Minister in 12 years leading the Liberal Party [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=197.66s)]
*  And it throws Canada into this period of uncertainty right as our new president Donald Trump come in its office [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=203.22s)]
*  Promising to slap [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=210.3s)]
*  25% tariffs on them. Here's a clip from Trudeau's speech announcing his decision on Monday [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  I intend to resign as party leader as Prime Minister [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  After the party selects its next leader through a robust [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=222.82000000000002s)]
*  nationwide competitive process [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=228.06s)]
*  Last night, I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=231.46s)]
*  This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=237.34s)]
*  Internal battles I [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=245.58s)]
*  Cannot be the best option in that election. He delivered that speech outdoors in Canada in January [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=247.74s)]
*  Yes, I was thinking about that a lot actually as I watched it in French and English [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=255.46s)]
*  Impressive when you watch these features, but kind of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=261.3s)]
*  Yeah, so Trudeau also said in his remarks that he's pro-roguing Parliament [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=264.94s)]
*  Which effectively ends the current session of Parliament without dissolving it and forcing new elections [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=269.0s)]
*  It's basically a way for the Liberal Party to get its shit together pick a new leader. It's sort of a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=273.68s)]
*  Leadership and priority reset and then go back into session on March 24th ahead of we assume elections this year [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=279.24s)]
*  They're supposed to happen in October, but we'll probably get moved up [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=286.08s)]
*  The new Liberal Party leader will be chosen by members of the Liberal Party that person becomes a prime minister [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  As we discussed before the break though [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=294.52s)]
*  Like the writing was on the wall for Trudeau over a while his polling was in the gutter [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=296.54s)]
*  One poll had his disapproval rating at 74% and only 16% of voters saying they were gonna vote for the Liberal Party [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=299.96s)]
*  And then in mid-december Trudeau's deputy prime minister Christopher and one of his closest allies or for a decade basically [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=306.52s)]
*  Resigned while also criticizing his economic stewardship of the country [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=313.32s)]
*  Then jug meets saying the head of the leftist New Democratic Party announced that he was gonna bring a no-confidence vote against Trudeau's government in January [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=317.56s)]
*  So Trudeau was getting ahead of that the Conservative Party leader Pierre Poliev is now best positioned to be the next prime minister of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=324.92s)]
*  Canada, although you know, we'll see but then let's just pause there [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean any thoughts from you first of all just on Trudeau's life and legacy here and then more specifically [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=333.8s)]
*  I'm wondering what role you think Trump played in forcing this move now [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=339.48s)]
*  Because obviously like his time in office had to have that and eventually but Poliev and Freeland [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=344.16s)]
*  Pointed to the Trump tariffs as a factor and either calling for him to go or [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=350.76s)]
*  Her decision to resign from the cabinet [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I'll start with a negative but then I want to pour one out for Justin Trudeau with some positive [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=359.16s)]
*  Look, I mean he clearly is facing the headwinds that everybody's facing and we'll talk about featuring throughout this podcast [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not good for incumbents more than that though. Look clearly he's lost touch, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=370.6s)]
*  He's been there for almost a decade and in you get a sense when a leader has just kind of lost the thread [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=374.92s)]
*  You know, and he's clearly kind of not been connected with the issues of Canadians are pissed off about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=380.24s)]
*  No surprise. That's cost of living. That's affordable housing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=385.56s)]
*  And his maneuvers to address issues have increasingly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=389.4s)]
*  Not only missed the mark they seem to just not be what people are looking for antagonize his own coalition [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=395.12s)]
*  So so it was time for him to step aside [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=401.2s)]
*  I will say, you know, we're living in an age where where people are just dunking on the libs [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=404.18s)]
*  And so Trudeau is gonna get dunked on a bunch, you know join the club [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=411.06s)]
*  Let's remember the Liberal Party was dead and buried came in third place in the election before Justin [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=416.22s)]
*  Yeah, this guy came not out of nowhere because he's a Trudeau [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=422.22s)]
*  He's a son of but he you know, he's a young guy who came in took over the party got elected and look [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=425.66s)]
*  He did a lot of good things over the course of the decade [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=430.44s)]
*  You know, he [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  Definitely elevated Canada's profile globally a lot of good things for climate [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=434.78s)]
*  I mean the carbon tax was one things he was [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=438.7s)]
*  unpopular for but I mean he's really moved [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=441.53999999999996s)]
*  Canada which is a fossil fuel producing country in the direction of being a good actor on climate [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=444.38s)]
*  There were some good economic years there [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=449.14s)]
*  Obviously was welcoming to refugees during the refugee crisis in a very important time foreign policy not big defense spenders [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=451.58s)]
*  But they've been out there on the right issues right in standing up for democracy [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  We we've talked about him willing to do things in the United States wasn't willing to do and calling out Modi [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  For the kinds of things he was doing inside of Canadian Affairs strong support of Ukraine [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=466.66s)]
*  So stepping back and I full disclosure not only we had to do on the pod [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=470.54s)]
*  His chief of staffers entire tenure Katie Telford is a good friend of mine and poor enough for Katie. She did a great job [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=475.06s)]
*  But you know [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=481.5s)]
*  They can feel good about this. Mm-hmm full stop now what? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  Nine years of it. Nine years. It's just a long time. I think that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=486.98s)]
*  Trump had something to do with it in the sense that Trudeau was very vulnerable [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=491.98s)]
*  He was gonna limp into the next election. Yeah, it didn't make any sense to me that he was gonna run again [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  It seemed like he wanted to host an xg7 in Canada and get through that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=499.82000000000005s)]
*  but you know, he was teetering and then Trump came in and I think was kind of the final straw because Freeland said in that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=503.82000000000005s)]
*  Letter resigning I just disagree with how you're approaching the Trump threat [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=509.18s)]
*  Yeah, he was offering basically a I think it was a two-month tax holiday to give [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=512.5s)]
*  Canadians some economic relief and she was like no we need that money to prepare to like harden the border and pay for all [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=517.62s)]
*  These things Trump's gonna demand out of us in exchange or else he's gonna slap tariffs on Canada [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=522.1s)]
*  Yeah, and so, you know, you could say Trump helped accelerate this and bring it about I will say for Trudeau. Can you imagine that? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=525.94s)]
*  Barack Obama Donald Trump and Joe Biden and then Donald Trump again like come on man [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=532.86s)]
*  Yeah, just give me one leader to do it right and and so, you know, it'll be interesting who comes next [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  You know Freeland leading candidate Melanie Jolie the foreign minister [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=542.1400000000001s)]

*  But look that may not be the best [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=550.7s)]
*  That may be a bit of a poison chalice for them [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=553.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=555.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=555.94s)]
*  Cuz the the conservatives were up 25 points and this is a right wing guy [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=556.14s)]
*  Pierre polio is is is really right wing and I thought Stephen Harper who was the guy before Trudeau is pretty right wing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=560.22s)]
*  This guy's like a friendly right wing. This guy's kind of tea party ish [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=565.7s)]
*  Maga type guy in Canada, you know [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=568.86s)]
*  Like remember those trucks that were parked in Ottawa like this guy was kind of on board with that defender them [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=570.82s)]
*  So, you know [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=575.38s)]
*  Okay, good luck with that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=577.06s)]
*  Canada you can get on the MAGA train with the rest of us by the way [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=578.98s)]
*  None of these people are gonna save you from Trump, you know, no, he's gonna do the tariffs. He's gonna talk shit to you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=581.86s)]
*  Anyway, so this idea that yeah Trudeau may have been handling it wrong, but I don't think there's a right answer [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=586.98s)]
*  so I [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=591.58s)]
*  Hope for the sake of the Liberal Party that they pick a good leader [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=593.38s)]
*  And they mount a strong showing because you don't want like right-wing dominance of that country [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  But I also don't think that there's some magic solution to Trump for them. No, I don't either [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=601.66s)]
*  I mean, I think to the extent Trudeau made a mistake. It's the one that every leader makes [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=606.2199999999999s)]
*  He probably hung on a little too long. Yeah, you know [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, I wonder if he gotten out six months ago [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  Would that have given the Liberal Party a chance to kind of get its feet under it? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=614.5s)]
*  Faster and you know be prepared for this election. Maybe it certainly would have prevented this scenario where there's just kind of a leadership [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=619.3s)]
*  Vacuum right as Trump is coming in and they're not gonna know how to deal with them [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=627.02s)]
*  It's worth noting that you know, Krista Freeland [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=631.06s)]
*  Deputy Prime Minister finance minister was singled out by Jared Kushner in Kushner's book [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=634.06s)]
*  He'd a disliked her for being kind of like a hard-edged negotiator in the USMCA talks. So credit to her [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah in a press conference Tuesday [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump said he was considering using economic force to make Canada a the 51st state of the United States [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=647.0999999999999s)]
*  The good news is he rejected the question of whether he'd used military force to make Canada a US state [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  So I will say to the the Jared Kushner thing [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=658.84s)]
*  You know one of those accomplishments is the USMCA trade agreement where they basically I mean [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=663.0s)]
*  tricked Trump into [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=669.8000000000001s)]
*  Thinking he got a big win by basically just rolling over and after yeah and the TPP [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=671.52s)]
*  So it like that was pretty savvy [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  But with Krista Freeland and Trudeau and and and Katie and then like they they you know this time around though [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=677.88s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna be able to do that. And so it's it's gonna be rough. It's gonna be rough ride [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=684.52s)]
*  I think yeah, man, there's these terror threats where everyone is just kind of banging around through one's politics [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=689.06s)]

*  So just a quick backstory back in December [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=807.76s)]
*  We covered South Korean president Yoon Suk-yool decision declared martial law that was quickly voted down by Parliament soon after he was impeached [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  Two weeks after Yoon's impeachment the acting president who took his place [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=817.48s)]
*  Was impeached because the acting president refused to name more judges to South Korea's constitutional court and that matters because that court will ultimately rule [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=821.88s)]
*  On whether to remove Yoon from office [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=830.34s)]
*  They'll also rule on whether to remove the impeached acting president by the way, but there's time for that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, but they're supposed to be nine members on the court. It's only six now [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=838.28s)]
*  So the opposition doesn't want to have to be a unanimous vote. So now South Korea has a new new acting president [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=841.16s)]
*  I think it's their third in three weeks, but somehow the story gets crazier [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=847.48s)]
*  so the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=850.6s)]
*  investigators from South Korea's corruption investigations office for high-ranking officials or CIO office [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=852.72s)]
*  They summoned union for questioning about whether or not he actually tried to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=858.64s)]
*  stage a coup [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  Yoon refused so the CIO got a warrant to detain him for questioning [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=866.12s)]
*  But you and lawyers argue that the CIO doesn't have the authority to investigate him or question him in any way [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  And so when the CIO sent a bunch of its members its agents investigators to Yoon's house [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=875.68s)]
*  To try to interview him or bring him in for questioning Yoon's security guards physically block them [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=882.56s)]
*  I think they made one of those human change. They made a human change. They made him and change those like hands around America [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=887.8s)]
*  They also I think they set up a bunch of buses as barricades. They put barbed wire on Yoon's home [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=892.8s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  I imagine though like an analogy for listeners thinking like what are you talking about? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=899.56s)]
*  Imagine like Bob Mueller rounded up a bunch of cops during the Mueller probe and trying to like go to the White House [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=902.88s)]
*  Well, I mean we could find out when Casper tell shows up at cricket [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=908.32s)]
*  Of cricket staffers, that'd be nice if they do that for us [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=913.16s)]
*  So eventually the CIO office the investigators gave up and they just stopped trying to bring him in for questioning [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=916.6s)]
*  By the way in the background of all of this Ben South Korea had this horrific plane crash. Yeah, it was December 29 [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=923.76s)]
*  179 people on [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  This Jeju Airlines flight were killed investigators don't know what happened. They're still trying to figure it out [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=933.32s)]
*  Yeah, the second acting president is now charged with kind of handling this, you know crisis internally for the country [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=938.48s)]
*  So Ben I just stepping back [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=945.4000000000001s)]
*  You see a lot of people experts quoted in stories about Yoon's insane behavior the last month or so [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=948.44s)]
*  Saying actually it'll be okay [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=955.36s)]
*  We have faith in South Korea's democracy and its institutions will hold and they'll work things out [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=957.0s)]
*  But it's pretty precarious [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=962.0s)]
*  And I do think it shows the way that someone like Yoon who is shameless [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=964.24s)]
*  Like strident and willing to do and say anything to stay in power [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=969.32s)]
*  It can exploit gaps in their system that is supposed to hold him accountable [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=974.12s)]
*  you know, he's basically exploiting this period of time between the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=978.2800000000001s)]
*  National Assembly voting to impeach in the court deciding whether he's removed to create mass chaos [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=981.8000000000001s)]
*  Feels a little familiar to us. I guess is completely insane this story [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=987.24s)]
*  I mean, this will be a theme of this entire podcast, but probably the next four years four years this guy [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=991.1600000000001s)]
*  First of all to your point about his psychology. I don't think he's left this residence [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=996.64s)]
*  Since like the coup attempt. So talk about TV show not to make a light of it, but just what is he doing? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1002.08s)]
*  He's like, we know the man in the high castle like walking around with like the presidential detail [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1008.38s)]
*  You know [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1012.88s)]
*  He moved the the residents from the Blue House to the Defense Ministry [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1014.88s)]
*  Yeah, which actually is very unpopular because it's more like in downtown Seoul and pissed everybody off because [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1018.56s)]
*  Yeah, but imagine a guy just in the middle of the biggest city in the country just hold up [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1023.4s)]
*  And look at some point I you know, the die will be cast [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1028.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't think this guy has enough support to mount some extra constitutional challenge, but who knows? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1031.28s)]
*  He's kind of he's holding out in the hopes that this judicial process can get slowed down [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1037.72s)]
*  The act they're impeaching acting presidents now that these are not the strongest leaders. I've noticed the opposition is impeaching everyone [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1043.0s)]
*  So it is a crisis that has its own momentum of just generating more crisis like [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1051.76s)]
*  And something is going to have to you know, kind of be that the turning point and it's probably gonna have to be [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1058.36s)]
*  The resolution of this guy's status like he's gonna get arrested and we all can move on and have an election [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1065.16s)]
*  Like until they do that they're in this precarious position full stop [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1069.92s)]
*  I think the bigger challenge here is that this is you know a volatile part of the world [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1073.64s)]
*  I mean if you're Kim Jong-un and you're looking at this you're thinking you [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1077.4s)]
*  Now at the time I start kind of poking the bear here like a bit with some provocative actions [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1081.72s)]
*  I got Trump coming in we're one Trump press conference away from Trump's, you know musing that maybe Kim Jong-un should take over South Korea [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1086.6s)]
*  He's a strong leader [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1094.02s)]
*  You know [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1095.08s)]
*  I mean [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1095.36s)]
*  These are things that we have to start entertaining our head that this could actually if the chaos continues like this [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1095.52s)]
*  Present some kind of opportunity for at least a provocation from Kim Jong-un [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1101.76s)]
*  It's certainly not good for the United States to have one of its anchor allies in Asia like admired in this kind of complete chaos [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1105.44s)]
*  So she Tony Blinken was just there and he had to do a press conference [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1112.04s)]
*  I think with the foreign minister. Yeah, you kept getting asked about this [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1115.24s)]
*  I mean the news out of it was that Tony said a thousand North Korean troops have been killed in Ukraine [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1118.36s)]
*  Which is pretty eye-popping number and also that the Russians were giving the North Koreans a bunch of technology [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1122.2s)]
*  Including space and satellite technology. I think as we sort of predicted on this show [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1127.8400000000001s)]
*  But yeah, Tony's kind of like has to account for why the US made this big bet on you [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1132.2s)]
*  Yeah, and this reproach mob between South Korea and Japan [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  What they thought was like a legacy. I'm sure that then when this trip was planned in the summer is like a legacy [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1142.16s)]
*  like [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1147.88s)]
*  Victory lap and yeah, this is this is a mess. I mean, there's no other way to put it and you know [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1148.92s)]
*  South Korea has been pretty resilient, you know [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1154.24s)]
*  They resisted the coup attempt, but they don't seem to have like a clear process for handling this phase of things [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  Or at least it's like it's like the US it's like you said [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1162.52s)]
*  The you assume that someone's gonna buy by the norms [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1165.44s)]
*  so like you assume this guy is gonna present himself to the prosecutor's office or [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1168.24s)]
*  Be arrested when people show up to arrest him and once one guy doesn't buy by the norms [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1171.64s)]
*  You're in like untreaded territory [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1176.6999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1178.54s)]
*  And I read that it could take six months for the court to make a decision on whether to remove Yoon [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1179.22s)]
*  that creates a lot of space for trouble between now and then in South Korean politics are extremely polarized and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1184.78s)]
*  conservatives are rallying around Yoon in this moment because they [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  They hate the opposition and they like that he's fighting and to your point about you know [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1194.02s)]
*  Like the kind of institutions not working perfectly the CIO was established in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1198.08s)]
*  2021 [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1202.1799999999998s)]
*  Following the impeachment of President Park who was removed in [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  2017 after a bunch of corruption and abuse of power charges [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1207.3s)]
*  And so I clearly like they didn't work out all the kinks here [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1210.56s)]
*  No, no [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1214.2199999999998s)]
*  and again like we always talk about South Korea as this like economic miracle as [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1214.6999999999998s)]
*  compared to North Korea because you know, the armistice happens in 1953 ends the fighting but not the war and [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1218.82s)]
*  fast forward in North Korea is this like backwards place where you know [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1224.9399999999998s)]
*  You can't see it from space in South Korea is this unbelievable vibrant economy [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1229.0s)]
*  But the that that story is kind of incomplete [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1233.28s)]
*  The truth is that from 1953 to 1987 South Korea went through this series of kind of military coups and dictatorships and [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1236.0s)]
*  authoritarian governments and as recently as 1980 there were [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1243.64s)]
*  uprisings put down [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1248.4s)]
*  by violent force by the Korean military where [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1250.0s)]
*  Hundreds if not thousands of people were killed like depending on which account you believe and by the way [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1253.4s)]
*  I think the US trained those South Korean. Yeah, of course we did approve them being sent in to like put down this protest [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1258.2s)]
*  so there's just a very recent history of a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1266.0s)]
*  Martial law declaration ending very very badly for South Korea. That's got to be terrifying. Yeah [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1269.68s)]
*  I mean, this is a post-cold war, you know end of Cold War kind of democracy story and [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1274.88s)]
*  We you can't you know, we have to expand our imaginations in the spirit of history [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1280.52s)]
*  You know that these things aren't all settled right like democracies don't always stay democracies [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1285.76s)]
*  Wars aren't always prevented [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1291.92s)]
*  This is you know [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1294.4s)]
*  What's so interesting me Tommy's it you've got this vibrant economy in this incredibly almost like superpower pop culture, right with kpop and and [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1295.96s)]
*  Television and and yet their politics is an absolute dumpster fire right now, you know, I'm in a glass house here [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1303.88s)]
*  So I'm not guessing they're the only ones but but this is gonna be a dumpster. Yeah [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1310.3600000000001s)]
*  Be hard to get out of and Japan is not exactly have stable politics either [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1315.3000000000002s)]
*  So this is not the best time for US allies right now and in Europe or Asia will get to Europe next [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1318.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1324.5400000000002s)]
*  And look I don't I don't fault the Biden administration for trying to push this reproach mot between South Korea and Japan [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1324.94s)]
*  But you do need to wonder the degree to which it might have contributed to the polarization [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1331.98s)]
*  And the anger and just the kind of zero some nature of honestly [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1337.2600000000002s)]
*  I mean I wasn't inside, you know those discussions now obviously but one of the reasons we we push those rap [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1341.06s)]
*  Bush mons and we got meetings between the Japanese and South Koreans in the US [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1346.76s)]
*  but [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1351.34s)]
*  one of the things that the South Korean lead both South Korean presidents that we dealt in the Obama administration would tell us is I [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1351.98s)]
*  Can only go so far without inviting like a real backlash here, you know, so that's not the precise cause of this [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1357.02s)]
*  I mean, there's all kinds of reach that this guy had but it does show that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1363.46s)]
*  particularly in democracies, you know one thing we've all learned is [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1367.1s)]
*  You can't overly personalize these policies around one person, you know, because if that one person [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1370.38s)]
*  Isn't bringing everybody else along [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1378.02s)]
*  It's not gonna be durable. I mean, that's certainly what's happened a lot of things I worked on in government for sure [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1379.94s)]
*  Yeah, one day you're singing American pie at the state dinner [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1384.74s)]
*  Well, the good news is been Donald Trump's gonna take charge and everything we fixed so he did [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1392.5800000000002s)]
*  He popped off a bunch over the break. He did a press conference today that really veered into crazy talk [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1398.5s)]
*  So we're gonna talk about those proposals seriously and cover them because I actually I think they're I think they're serious [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1403.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're not musings. Um, so I guess we should we also just assumed the presidency before being sworn in [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1407.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that part complicates things. So let's start with the Greenland piece of this Ben [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1413.98s)]
*  So on December 22nd Trump announced his pick to be ambassador to Denmark. It was a truth social post, of course [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1417.06s)]
*  And in that post he said quote for purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world the United States of America feels [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1423.34s)]
*  That the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity end quote [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1429.58s)]
*  Folks probably remember Trump floated this idea back in 2019 as well [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1433.4199999999998s)]
*  Greenland is currently an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1437.06s)]
*  But it primarily self governs except on matters of defense and foreign policy [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1440.6599999999999s)]
*  Greenland's Prime Minister Muta egg ghoul did not take kindly to Trump's post [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1445.1s)]
*  Responding by saying that the country is quote not for sale [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1449.98s)]
*  And if anything Trump seemed to add more fuel to the fire in the political movement for Greenland's full independence [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1452.82s)]
*  Prime Minister signal in a New Year's address that 2025 could be a year to remove quote the shackles of colonialism [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1458.6599999999999s)]
*  But you know not helping matter Don Jr. Visited Greenland today. He went with Charlie Kirk the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1465.34s)]
*  Little right-wing fascist that's a PUSA guy and this other dipshit from the transition team to shoot video for his podcasts [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1471.78s)]
*  Of course, by the way the guy from the transition teams added personnel. Yeah, the Sergio Gores. Yeah, it's kind of random [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1479.34s)]
*  Right. I don't know why that guy I think I'll just like him like he was like a normie [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1484.8999999999999s)]
*  I think okay like Rubio guy maybe and he just kind of got his way into this into the club [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  So like on a policy level Ben wanting to have ownership of Greenland is not crazy [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1495.22s)]
*  I think thanks to climate change their Arctic sea roots are opening up [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1500.74s)]
*  Greenland is also melting and there's all these valuable natural resources [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1504.94s)]
*  Minerals metals, etc. It hosts a US base but talking about it like Trump does is crazy [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1508.94s)]
*  Here's a clip from Trump's press conference today, Tuesday the 7th [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1515.62s)]
*  Can you assure the world that as you try to? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1519.54s)]
*  Get control of these areas you are not going to use military or economic coercion [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1524.34s)]
*  No, can you tell us a little bit about what your plan is? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1530.1s)]
*  Are you going to negotiate a new treaty? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1534.14s)]
*  Are you going to ask the Canadians to hold the vote? What what is the strategy? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1536.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I can't assure you you're talking about Panama and Greenland. No, I can't assure you on either of those two [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1541.22s)]
*  But I can say this [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1547.42s)]
*  We need them for economic security [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1549.6200000000001s)]
*  The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1552.42s)]
*  China and we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China. Well, we need Greenland for [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1558.42s)]
*  National security purposes. I've been told that for a long time long before I even ran [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1565.46s)]
*  I mean people have been talking about it for a long time. You have approximately [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1570.42s)]
*  45,000 people there people really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1574.74s)]
*  But if they do they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1581.28s)]
*  I'm talking about protecting the free world you look at you don't even need binoculars you look outside you have China [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1585.9s)]
*  Ships all over the place you have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1593.4599999999998s)]
*  Who's binoculars is it talking about? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1600.4199999999998s)]
*  Where would one be Sarah Palin wouldn't know where would one be using the binoculars from Greenland or from the United States? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1602.78s)]
*  The question is you know about Google Earth [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1609.82s)]
*  The question there is David Sanger from the New York Times. So you know very well you could tell David asked his question [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1612.3799999999999s)]
*  He gets the hard no like the newsiest answer like no [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1618.46s)]
*  I will not rule out invading fucking Greenland in Panama and you can tell it just doesn't register [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1621.46s)]
*  Never happens like if people are usually careful [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1627.14s)]
*  Wow, so I bet I'll get to the Panama out portion of this in a minute I [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1631.38s)]
*  Mean again like if he's probably blustering about a military invasion. I [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1635.46s)]
*  Do not think he's kidding about wanting to control Greenland at all [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1639.5s)]
*  I think this is going to be a relentless focus [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1642.8200000000002s)]
*  And I'd say a couple of broad things that actually you're gonna apply to Panama too, but I'll then on Greenland first of all [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, this is a classic case of you know [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1652.1799999999998s)]
*  Trump is won't ever stand up to a guy like Putin [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1655.22s)]
*  But he'll push around 50,000 people in Greenland or Panama, you know, I mean classic bully behavior, right? Denmark [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1658.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's picking fights at Denmark and Panama and Canada. He would never actually pick a real fight with Russia or China [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1663.8999999999999s)]
*  but then secondly, I [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1672.1s)]
*  Actually am really worried about this. I mean I literally spent a lot of time thinking about this because [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1674.34s)]
*  He's what 78 years old. I mean if you apply the logic of any aging [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1680.1s)]
*  Narcissistic autocrat in all of human history. They all believe they need territorial conquest to be [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1688.1799999999998s)]
*  Remembered a certain way right to be on Mount Rushmore to be a great leader [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1695.78s)]
*  He's looking at Putin he saw Putin take Crimea who got a big boost in the polls that kind of thing matters to Trump [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1699.66s)]
*  I take this [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1705.5s)]
*  Profoundly seriously. I believe him that he wants to get Greenland while he's president [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1707.3000000000002s)]
*  I truly believe he wants to do that and and the same thing is true with Panama [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1712.22s)]
*  And by the way, it is like if the US suddenly snapped its fingers and control Greenland tomorrow [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1716.14s)]
*  There are tons of natural resources and strategic reasons why that would be beneficial [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1721.7s)]
*  And I I don't know what exactly his play is because it's not really for sale [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1726.3s)]
*  It's not a real it's not a real estate property that Denmark owns that they can sell us [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1731.26s)]
*  I think you know what he might want to do is to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1735.3s)]
*  dangle a bunch of money in front of those 50,000 people and be like a well you can be part of the United States and [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1739.6599999999999s)]
*  We'll pour some money into you. Well, he's probably trying to buy. I don't know what Don Jr is doing over there [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1744.5s)]
*  What he might be doing is, you know [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1750.62s)]
*  In addition to drugs just kidding what he might be doing is yeah, no, just kidding no libel happened here [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1753.1399999999999s)]
*  Exactly, we all take drugs like that on vacation [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1760.3799999999999s)]
*  But you know find the person in Greenland who says yeah [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1763.4599999999998s)]
*  We want to be with the Americans, you know [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1767.62s)]
*  and then suddenly you have a basis for a dispute and you say well look these people would rather be American and so I [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1769.1999999999998s)]
*  We can all laugh at this because it is kind of funny [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1775.1s)]
*  But I also think that we'll be talking about this a lot in the coming weeks [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  You know it like sounded ridiculous in 2019 [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1780.42s)]
*  I think it's not at all and I think Bloomberg tried to take the idea seriously too [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1783.54s)]
*  And I think they came to the same conclusion you did about how the process might work like you'd kind of want or need game [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1787.5s)]
*  Greenland to gain independence first and then decide to sell itself to the US. Yeah [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  They weren't thinking about the invasion option. I mean they also they also tried to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1798.5s)]
*  Estimate the cost of Greenland [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1802.54s)]
*  They noted that its GDP in 2021 was roughly three point two billion dollars and then it gets about six hundred million a year from Denmark [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1803.94s)]
*  Annually, so I don't know how you value a country [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1812.5s)]
*  But here's the thing if he keeps saying it's a national every time he talks about he says it's a national security issue [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1815.14s)]
*  I think that means he wants to put money in the defense budget, you know, so the defense budget's a trillion dollars [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1819.94s)]
*  That is what X of you know, the GDP of Greenland or the five hundred and fifty million dollar subsidy [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1825.94s)]
*  From Denmark, so there's a lot of money that he could yeah with here, but how do we do this valuation? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1832.42s)]
*  We're doing a p-e ratio or you know multiple and you better or [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1836.5400000000002s)]
*  Footage, you know [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  The tech company like a 20x multiple. I mean the other thing is like Trump [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1842.18s)]
*  We've seen him bust norms and get away with it. Right? Yeah, you guys had a great episode on January 6 yesterday [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1846.42s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do the same thing internationally? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1852.6200000000001s)]
*  Like why wouldn't he roll up the US Navy to wherever it can actually land in Greenland and just say it's ours [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1854.46s)]
*  I mean, this is a man who literally sent a mob to the Capitol and then got elected president [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1860.2s)]
*  So you think he's you know worried about the norms against like invading Greenland? I don't think so. No, I don't either [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1864.92s)]
*  I think we should lease it though just in case [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1871.88s)]
*  New well, yeah, it's like it's like the electric cars, you know, like you got to wait for the battery to get better [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1874.8000000000002s)]

*  Listeners also probably remember Trump being very angry about the Panama Canal back in the day [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1965.02s)]
*  He says now the US is being ripped off by Panama and that Panama is charging US commercial and naval vessels [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1969.58s)]
*  exorbitant fees for traffic for going through the canal [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1975.22s)]
*  Trump said if the rates are not lowered quote [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1978.18s)]
*  We will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the US in full quickly and without question [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1980.7s)]
*  So some quick history and background on the Panama Canal. It was built between 1904 and 1914 [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1985.32s)]
*  The US completed the project. It was started by the French. It spans 50 miles through like, you know mountainous terrain [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1990.1399999999999s)]
*  It required workers working in brutal conditions or rampant mosquito-borne diseases like yellow fever and malaria [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=1997.28s)]
*  tens of thousands of workers died [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2004.0s)]
*  Over the entirety of the French and American construction effort mostly workers from the Caribbean [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2006.32s)]
*  The US controlled the canal until Jimmy Carter signed two treaties in 1977 that handed [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2010.88s)]
*  Over control of the canals of the Panamanians while also guaranteeing US access to it Panama took sole control of the Panama Canal in [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2016.6000000000001s)]
*  1999 for context 14,000 ships go through the Panama Canal per year including 40% of all US container traffic [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2023.8s)]
*  We make up 75% of the canals total traffic [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2031.08s)]
*  So there are some truth to the idea that rates have gone up [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2034.88s)]
*  That is because there was an extreme drought that dried up the lake that allowed that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2037.32s)]
*  You know has the water that goes into the canal and allows it to function. Thank you climate change [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2042.48s)]
*  I'm not aware of any evidence that the US is being charged more money than other countries [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2046.92s)]
*  I don't know if you are but Ben my theory for why Trump is obsessed with the Panama Canal [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2051.88s)]
*  Is that he remembers when this was a huge political issue? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2057.28s)]
*  Yes, it was before the Big Mac's the kind of hard in his brain. Yeah, the Diet Cokes. Yep [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2060.32s)]
*  Reagan used to attack Jimmy Carter on this all the time [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2065.76s)]
*  The mantra was we built it we paid for it and we're gonna keep it if you read any Rick Perlstein book [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2068.46s)]
*  I was gonna you still might take [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2072.78s)]
*  So like anyway Carter he called Carter we called him [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2076.52s)]
*  Keep going it folded into I think Cold War hysteria about Russian influence in or Soviet influence in Latin America [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2079.36s)]
*  But again, I see the strategic value of Greenland. I don't get being mad about the canal [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2086.28s)]
*  I think you're exactly right and we did not coordinate these takes before and people just we we actually totally agree on this one [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2091.7400000000002s)]
*  I was thinking about Reagan land the very pristine book [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2097.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, I was consuming Rick Perlstein like Twitter fights with Mark and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2101.0s)]
*  I [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2104.46s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2107.3399999999997s)]
*  Praline say that in recent said at a dinner party something about OxyContin something about like people from like basically poor white people who retail [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2109.8999999999996s)]
*  But I og should like he's glad there's oxy and video games and video games to distract them from being so [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2117.66s)]
*  Pathetic that's a shitty thing to say it was a shitty thing to say and recent denies it we should [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2124.02s)]
*  And he denies it that's [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2127.94s)]
*  Actually kind of entertaining [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2130.94s)]
*  But there is if people want to get more background [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2132.54s)]
*  It's actually really worth reading the pen long canal section of that Reagan land book because it's kind of the origin of this [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2134.5s)]
*  Kind of uber right wing fuck the world [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2140.1s)]
*  Jingoism, you know jingoism Reagan really did use it [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2143.54s)]
*  He was flown around the country and like a private jet making these speeches about how awful [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2146.7400000000002s)]
*  This was a betrayal of everything and and that that was clearly a time when Donald Trump was a good formative, right? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2151.46s)]
*  He was soaking in and I think basically what had probably happened here is yes [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2156.96s)]
*  China has more and more influence in Latin America generally not just panel everywhere, right? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2161.36s)]
*  Trump gets one briefing about how like the Chinese, you know have some interest somewhere in the kid cuz they're not running the Panama Canal [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2166.1200000000003s)]
*  He's lying about that, but they have some you know, they have the economic presence in Panama [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2171.96s)]
*  He's like fuck it. Give it back to us, you know, and this is just red meat for right-wingers [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2175.76s)]
*  But so I don't think that there's some military play here. I think I take Greenland more seriously [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2180.6400000000003s)]
*  I actually think this is a much dumber play for him, too [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2185.72s)]
*  Because the Chinese do have more in more influence in Latin America [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2189.12s)]
*  And this is the kind of thing that is a gift to the Chinese they go to Panama [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  They go to all these other countries say look at the Americans. They're reverting back to their [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2197.7999999999997s)]
*  Imperial Cold War right asshole ourselves. We're just trying to make deals down here. We're building you ports, you know [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2202.52s)]
*  so I think I think the Trump years are gonna be a [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2209.7999999999997s)]
*  Massive boon to Chinese influence in Latin America because Latin America hates this shit, you know the Panamanians it's it's in their land [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  It's their canal like not just because the treaty it's like it's an absurd proposition [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2220.12s)]
*  the United States would somehow be running like a piece of [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2224.84s)]
*  Water way in Panama in 2024 or base in Cuba [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2228.76s)]
*  Exactly the same thing right? So I don't know like he I could see some dumb thing where he like puts [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2233.44s)]
*  Sanctions or tariffs on Panama, but to what end like what is he? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2241.04s)]
*  I don't even get what he's asking for like either do we really want to operate the Panama Canal again with the US military? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2244.04s)]
*  like just to [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2248.72s)]
*  You know usher some [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  Or something do we want to connect do we want to collect fees on the Maersk shipping containers? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2252.56s)]
*  Good like he's not even saying what he wants there [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2257.16s)]
*  So I think this is kind of just weird right-wing red meat, but I don't know he'll do something [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2259.6s)]
*  I assume right and it's also worth noting that Reagan won the election. He became president for eight years [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2265.2999999999997s)]
*  He didn't take back the canal we may just be the libs who just point out that these things are [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2270.62s)]
*  More immoral and unethical while like Trump vacuums up the canal in Greenland and gets his fucking face in that rush [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2276.14s)]
*  Yeah, but I think Reagan ultimately decided that you know okay. He was a big cold warrior [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2282.9s)]
*  He was worried about Nicaragua and El Salvador and you know [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2287.42s)]
*  So he'd influence in other places and he thought maybe I shouldn't actually [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2290.3399999999997s)]
*  Rip off the Panamanians and try to make them an ally and that was part of what yeah [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2293.58s)]
*  That was absolutely Reagan's calculus that was certainly Carter's calculus and again Cold War thinking this is dumb [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2297.78s)]
*  Because the the Chinese are gonna get much more influence not just in Panama [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2304.86s)]
*  But across that region because of this I was reading about the Panama Canal just to go deep on this [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2308.82s)]
*  Apparently when the French it really is that it's a it's an incredible engineering accomplishment [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2313.3s)]
*  Done on the backs of you know massacring tens of thousands of people through a lot through mosquito-borne diseases [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2319.42s)]
*  But also just unbelievable working conditions these guys are like literally dynamiting mountains the dynamite will go off too early [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2325.78s)]
*  It would blow them up there would be landslides etc [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2332.1800000000003s)]
*  When the French were working on the Panama Canal they gave up eventually all these people were getting sick [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2334.38s)]
*  So they set up field hospitals and the patients in the field hospitals were lying in bed [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2339.8s)]
*  And what would happen is like these like army ants or something would crawl up the bedpost and crawl all over them [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2343.6400000000003s)]
*  It just drove them insane right so what the French did was here? Oh truly [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2348.7400000000002s)]
*  So what they did though was they put the four corners of the beds in little water cups which prevented the ants from crawling up [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2352.86s)]
*  But created the perfect grounds for mosquitoes to lay their eggs which drastically [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2359.3s)]
*  Exacerbated the disease issue the yellow fever and the malaria etc [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2365.1800000000003s)]
*  What are the innovations that the US had was actually I think? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2368.98s)]
*  Figuring out that these were mosquito-borne diseases figuring out you know mitigation efforts putting up screens in like the you know the lowest-paid workers [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2372.42s)]
*  Homes like putting oil and standing water etc to try to defeat the diseases, but yeah nasty stuff [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2381.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well now we now we want it back. I guess let's get that back. You know Woodrow Wilson [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2387.7s)]
*  I think as the one who pressed the button in the Oval Office that set off the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2392.98s)]
*  Dynamite that detonated the dike that was holding back the water and like finally flooded the canal. That's a cool thing to do [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2399.1s)]
*  I've seen did you seen the Panama Canal no it's pretty extraordinary like we went there was a some of the Americas down there and [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2403.8799999999997s)]
*  There these huge locks right these huge things that you know the opening close and the ships go through it's pretty cool [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2410.3799999999997s)]
*  It is so maybe Trump just wants to press the button and it's like loves big hardware [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2416.18s)]
*  Let them open the thing alright then we talked about a bunch of ways the world kind of feels unsteady at the moment [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2422.06s)]
*  One reason why is a guy named Elon Musk yes, so [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2428.9399999999996s)]
*  Elon he's taken his global interference project global we talked about this a bit on pod save America yesterday [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2433.22s)]
*  But I think you and I could really geek out and begin, but let's focus on Germany the UK Canada anywhere else you want [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2439.46s)]
*  In Germany Elon has been attacking Chancellor Olaf Schultz the Social Democrat [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2444.5s)]
*  He's endorsed the far-right AFD party both on Twitter and then in an op-ed [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2449.18s)]
*  He wrote for this conservative online newspaper owned by Axel Springer the same company that owns politico in the US [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2453.76s)]
*  Remember though all of these other political parties in Germany refused to work with the AFD because they are so extreme German intelligence [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2459.94s)]
*  Consider as parts of the AFD and extremist group and some of the leaders [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2467.16s)]
*  They just keep accidentally using banned Nazi era slogans at political rallies [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2470.8s)]
*  Just like you hate when that happens when a Nazi slogan just kind of slips out as yeah campaigning in Thuringia [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2475.2s)]
*  In the UK muskets own shown support for the right-wing Reform Party [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2481.64s)]
*  He met with reform leader Nigel Farage at Mar-a-Lago [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2485.68s)]
*  Farage said Elon floated donating up to a hundred million dollars to the Reform Party [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2488.92s)]
*  Hilariously though Elon then said Farage quote doesn't have what it takes to lead reform because Farage isn't a fan of this violent [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2493.48s)]
*  Right-wing thug named Tommy Robinson who we can get into or not depending on where this goes [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2500.8s)]
*  Elon has been attacking Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party most recently dredging up this horrible story from over a decade ago about [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2506.28s)]
*  1,400 or more kids young girls who are sexually abused in what came to be called the grooming gang scandal [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2514.52s)]
*  It is a truly awful story [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2521.08s)]
*  The local police failed to protect these kids on every level in part because they were worried about [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  Singling out Pakistani men in a way that could be perceived as racist [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2527.84s)]
*  But Elon has decided to really pick up and demagogue this ignoring the fact that the Tory Party was of course running the government during [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  this period [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2538.04s)]
*  But Trump is saying like you know it's Starmer is to blame he deserves to be in prison etc [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2539.2400000000002s)]
*  And then back in December going back to Canada Elon tweeted about Pierre Paulie have the Conservative Party leader [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2543.44s)]
*  He said quote seems great in response to a tweet from some Canadian professor about Paulie of [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2548.92s)]
*  That was a clip of him advocating for bombing Iran [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2555.24s)]
*  Or supporting an Israeli military strike on Iran. I thought mega was anti-war now, but I guess not for Elon [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2561.12s)]
*  So then heads of state in France Germany Norway in the UK they've all responded to Elon Musk in some way in in the press [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2566.48s)]
*  Here's a clip of Keir Starmer responding to Elon's attacks at a press conference that was supposed to be about [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2573.98s)]
*  fixing Britain's National Health Service on the question of Elon Musk look I [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2579.54s)]
*  I think most people are more interested in what's gonna have the NHS frankly [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2585.58s)]
*  Than what's happening on Twitter those that are spreading lies and in misinformation as far and as wide as possible [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2589.9s)]
*  They're not interested in victims [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2598.54s)]
*  They're interested in themselves [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2601.94s)]
*  So Ben I think the question here we should try to answer is why why do you think Elon is doing this? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2604.86s)]
*  I I honestly think that Elon has gotten [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2611.02s)]
*  There's an ego answer and a practical answer and the ego answer [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2615.94s)]
*  He's gotten this taste of like world power and domination [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2618.8199999999997s)]
*  You know and and I think he's got a personality type everything that you see about the guy [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2622.38s)]
*  that is kind of this boundless ego and ambition and [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2627.14s)]
*  He feels clearly like he bought and won an election here [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2630.86s)]
*  I'm sure that in his head Elon Musk thinks he made the difference for Trump and maybe he did actually this really bought his place [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2634.42s)]
*  in the [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2640.0800000000004s)]
*  administration and then he's looking at the world and he's seeing [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2640.9s)]
*  One thing that people have to understand particularly our American listeners is that there's not a lot of money in politics in these places [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2644.1400000000003s)]
*  Like nobody's ever spent hundred million dollars now on a British election not even close to it, right? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2649.86s)]
*  Germany France and if he can find ways if you have unlimited a hundred million dollars to him is like a hundred bucks to you [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2655.2200000000003s)]
*  And me right if he can find ways to just plow money into places [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2661.06s)]
*  He's like well I can become the global oligarch not just the American oligarch if I can start, you know [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2664.94s)]
*  Picking winners now what he's picking is consistently the far-right [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2670.42s)]
*  I mean the AFD then in Germany the National Front in France [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  But whatever nutcase, you know the reform party or even the nuttier guy in the UK the right-wing guy in Canada [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2678.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's this is really dangerous [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2684.3s)]
*  I mean, I think this like Greenland we have to take this seriously because Elon Musk has the money to do this [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2686.5800000000004s)]
*  Now what countries need to do is prevent it [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2691.98s)]
*  It's illegal in the UK for instance for a foreigner to just donate a hundred million dollars to a political party [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2694.5s)]
*  What's not illegal though is you you you spend a hundred million dollars, you know [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2699.6200000000003s)]
*  You you set up a media outlet you set up some NGO and and it's all to promote their foreign party [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2703.5400000000004s)]
*  but it what these countries need to do if they're serious about this is to [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2709.6000000000004s)]
*  Fortify their own [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2713.64s)]
*  Electoral systems so that they're not like us so that there's not a we the Supreme Court [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2715.4s)]
*  We're cautionary tale [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2720.34s)]
*  Yeah, we're the cut don't become us like the Supreme Court under Citizens United allowed for unlimited money and unlimited dark money [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2721.2s)]
*  But what he's showing us is this ambition to fuck around everywhere this clear far-right preference, right? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2728.2s)]
*  You know, this guy clearly has far-right tendencies [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2734.44s)]
*  Those are the only parties he's supporting if I were to find it like a practical reason [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2737.0s)]
*  You and I've talked about this offline a bit Tommy like he seems to want to be disrupting everything and I think he believes [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2743.3s)]
*  That it will serve his economic interests whether that's his investments that he's gonna make into crypto [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2750.74s)]
*  Whether that's the kind of state like power of Starlink and Tesla and SpaceX [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2757.58s)]
*  He clearly thinks disruption helps him in some way [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2762.54s)]
*  I I'm not inside of his businesses or what his ambitions are for crypto [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2765.56s)]
*  I mean if you like crypto and you see that as a place you're gonna put more and more money you kind of want [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2770.04s)]
*  Governments to fail because then people don't rely on government currencies and they go to places crypto [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2776.36s)]
*  So that could enter into it, but I take this very the last answer Tommy is man [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2781.26s)]
*  Elon Musk is simultaneously what people used to admire about the United States like an immigrant entrepreneur comes in does well [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2787.04s)]
*  But this has got to make I people must fucking hate us by the end of by the end of the Trump term [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2792.32s)]
*  Like I don't know how people are gonna feel about the United States in most of these places [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2798.48s)]
*  Because the arrogance of just going and messing around in their politics [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2802.04s)]
*  And and and and with no regard even to the history in Germany are talking with the AFG taking people neo-nazi roots [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2807.0s)]
*  Just because it kind of entertains you right mine is really grotesque. Yeah, I mean you [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2814.88s)]
*  We've talked a lot about the AFD. I mean, I think it's worth knowing like Tommy Robinson this this kind of online [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2821.2400000000002s)]
*  pot stirring [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2827.1000000000004s)]
*  Extremist in the UK like he was too extreme for Nigel Farage. I think Farage left the UK party [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2828.98s)]
*  Who's a comparison it'd be like that who's that any semi who went to Mar-a-Lago and had like yeah Nick Fuentes Nick Fuentes [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2834.9s)]
*  It's like that level of trolley fucking goon. Yes if Nick Fuentes was mixed with a soccer hooligan [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2840.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, who was really violent and gotten lots of fights and had gone to jail a bunch of times [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2847.0600000000004s)]
*  I think for there was some domestic abuse. I think there was a big mortgage fraud thing [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2851.46s)]
*  Andrew Tate Nick Fuentes. Yeah, and yeah, yeah in the irony about Tommy Robinson [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2855.78s)]
*  I think like sensibly Elon says he likes him because he's standing up to the grooming gangs and like fighting the woke forces [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2860.42s)]
*  That allowed them to fester Tommy Robinson went to one of the trials of these grooming gangs [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2867.34s)]
*  Filmed it in contravention of British rules that are supposed to keep the jury from getting [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2873.1800000000003s)]
*  tarnished or learning about things that are happening and also [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2879.42s)]
*  Rules they have set up to protect the identity of victims and was live-streaming it and they arrested him for that and [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2882.2799999999997s)]
*  His actions that day almost got the case overturned [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2888.64s)]
*  So we almost helped get these guys off for their horrific abuse of children because of his actions [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2892.52s)]
*  So like the idea that he is some noble, you know protector of young kids is like completely backwards [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2897.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think one thing [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2904.64s)]
*  You know, I was ruminating on this over the break to with [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2906.7999999999997s)]

*  Elon right now and [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2917.68s)]
*  I think part of what is probably weighing on people, you know [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2920.24s)]
*  Certainly pot say the world listeners is like they're winning like they're winning like they they're these fucking ketamine taking [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2924.0s)]
*  crypto bro [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2932.16s)]
*  Assholes right who [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2934.3999999999996s)]
*  Like live in a world with no values and no guardrails and no behavioral constraints [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2936.72s)]
*  Like we have to acknowledge that they're winning. They run the United States of America as of you know, a couple weeks from now [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2943.04s)]
*  The every and and right now you see even the media does not process it, you know, like so it's it's it's you know [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2950.48s)]

*  What is Elon, you know, there's a kind of a [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2958.24s)]
*  There's a kind of a [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2960.48s)]
*  Because people kind of worship wealth and celebrity in this country [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2962.48s)]
*  It's it's viewed as interesting and not dangerous that that Elon is doing all this [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2965.76s)]
*  Nobody's pointing out that you know, if brock obama or joe biden or or george w bush by the way [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2969.76s)]
*  Had like the richest person in the world hanging out with them [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2976.0s)]
*  With huge government responsibilities with huge conflicts of interest and huge ambitions to meddle in the politics of other countries on that the far-right parties [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2979.2000000000003s)]
*  The world would have like imploded and now it's like how interesting is this right? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2987.6800000000003s)]

*  I acknowledge that more people want them to be in charge than one democrats to be in charge [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2994.88s)]
*  That does not make it right [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=2999.44s)]
*  And that does not mean that they're going to win in the end whenever the end is right and we have to remind ourselves of that [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3000.96s)]
*  These people want to create a sense of inevitability that they have so much money and so much power [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3007.04s)]
*  That it's just going to be their world and I don't think we have to accept that and that's why I think it's good [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3011.76s)]
*  You know if I was schultz and not that schultz is gonna be around that long then mcrone and starman all [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3017.2000000000003s)]
*  They they they better protect themselves while they can. Yeah. I I want to talk about the response [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3022.0800000000004s)]
*  I was thinking about the theories of why too. It's like [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3026.4s)]
*  I like maybe he's a genuinely unstable guy who does like [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3028.48s)]
*  Drugs and spends too much time on twitter and is easily swayed by a right-wing adjuvant [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3033.04s)]
*  Maybe he is kind of a fascist and just has like a genuine like for these people maybe he's softening up [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3037.04s)]
*  Leaders that trump doesn't like on trump's behalf in some way, maybe there's a business interest [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3043.04s)]
*  I know tesla's got a manufacturing plant in germany. I don't know if that's relevant [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3047.68s)]
*  misinformation on twitter played this [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3053.18s)]
*  A big role in those far-right riots in the uk last summer when elana's tweeting things like civil war is inevitable [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3055.12s)]
*  That led to a government crackdown on misinformation on social media, which I imagine, you know hits him in his pocket because of you know [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3061.7599999999998s)]
*  the financials of x [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3068.4s)]
*  Regardless i'm with you like these leaders need to figure out a way to respond. I think starmer was good in his [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3070.24s)]
*  press conference the other day [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3077.6s)]

*  I think it's a really important question and judging by the people he constantly interacts with I think it like leans the ladder [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3126.96s)]
*  Yeah, like you know like he could tweak the algorithm behind the scenes, but he's like responding to just weirdos [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3132.2400000000002s)]

*  Did you see that she has all these tweets? Yeah attacking marco rubio [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3334.4799999999996s)]
*  She got a little marco seven times. She referred to him as quote a kid waving frantically in the back of the room trying to prove relevance [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3338.4799999999996s)]
*  She called him a tool of the establishment and an inexperienced senator. He was never on a thing in his life [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3346.3999999999996s)]
*  If you want proof that marco rubio, I was talking to somebody who like is in one of these places where [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3351.7599999999998s)]
*  They kind of like marco rubio's foreign policy more than trump's so they're like well, don't you think rubio i'm like this guy [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3358.0s)]
*  From day one trump is going to set out not only will rubio not have any influence [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3363.12s)]
*  But they're going to humiliate him. I mean, you know [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3367.4399999999996s)]
*  Trump doesn't forget this stuff like trump didn't forget the 2016 election [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3370.56s)]
*  So he's basically going to humiliate this guy and this selection proves it [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3374.64s)]
*  The new spokeswoman for the state department in 2016 said she quote had to mute marco [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3378.88s)]
*  I think that's how you all you need to know about how she'll approach the job. Okay [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3384.2400000000002s)]
*  We talked about the trump administration. Let's talk about the biden administration starting with sudan ben [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3387.84s)]
*  Uh earlier today tuesday secretary of state tony blinken released a statement on the civil war in sudan [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3391.84s)]
*  Which has been raging since april of 2023 blinken said that one of the main paramilitary forces in the conflict the rsf or rapid [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3397.6s)]
*  Support forces had committed genocide so big determination the statement says in part quote [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3404.48s)]
*  The rsf and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys even infants on an ethnic basis and deliberately targeted women and girls [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3409.68s)]
*  From certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3417.04s)]
*  Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians murdering innocent people escaping conflict and prevented remaining civilians from accessing [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3420.72s)]
*  Life-saving supplies so a very clear-cut statement there tens of thousands people have been killed in sudan in this in the civil war [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3427.92s)]
*  Millions have been displaced [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3434.56s)]
*  In in the course of the two years of this conflict. Um, so ben just reading this a couple thoughts. I mean [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3436.4s)]
*  Obviously first we should talk about it [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3441.74s)]
*  But this genocide declaration is going to infuriate anyone who wants to see biden do something to stop the killing [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3443.68s)]
*  In gaza or put any pressure on the israelis to stop bombing, right? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3449.04s)]
*  Second it was notable. Look, i'm glad they did this [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3453.2799999999997s)]
*  It was notable though that this statement didn't put any real pressure on the uae. Yeah [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3455.6800000000003s)]
*  For funneling arms to the rsf. I can't remember if we talked about it on the show [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3461.36s)]
*  There was that weird letter from the white house from brett magurk to congress saying quote despite reports [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3464.88s)]
*  We have received suggesting the contrary has occurred to date [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3470.08s)]
*  The uae has informed the administration that it is not now transferring any weapons to the rsf [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3472.6400000000003s)]
*  It will not do so going forward sure seems to just [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3477.36s)]
*  That all seems to absolve them. Yeah, and it's complete. It's complete bullshit [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3480.8s)]
*  I mean the new york times has a tremendous investigation where they used, you know [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3485.36s)]
*  All kinds of sources including over at imagery and things [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3489.36s)]
*  And actually even you know, some of the the companies that are sanctioned by the biden administration have these connections to the way the [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3492.56s)]
*  the uae transits things across [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3500.88s)]
*  You know africa so to do this [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3503.6800000000003s)]
*  While running interference for the maraudis. I'm sorry. I mean like i'm like i'm glad they called this out [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3507.1200000000003s)]
*  but [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3512.88s)]
*  You know ultimately you have to if this is a genocide [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3513.76s)]
*  Then presumably the people that are [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3518.1600000000003s)]
*  Supporting the genocide should be held accountable [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3520.32s)]
*  Now [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3523.92s)]
*  I know that gaza echo is probably not good for the biden administration either right? Yeah [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3524.96s)]
*  so I I know I guess like this is useful in [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3529.84s)]
*  Spotlighting the horrific nature of the rsf. We should also point out that they are the [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3534.2200000000003s)]
*  Kind of legacy of the janjweed who were also found to be committing a genocide in darfur way back when [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3539.68s)]
*  These are some of the same characters, you know, and [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3545.92s)]
*  It may put additional pressure on the rsf internationally and that's good [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3549.2799999999997s)]
*  But ultimately, you know [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3553.2s)]
*  If you don't go after the people the sources of support for the rsf, it's it's not going to be as impactful [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3555.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking to um [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3561.52s)]
*  An expert that we used to work with about sudan before the break [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3563.6s)]
*  Who was telling me that like the the key to ending this war it sounds like [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3567.1200000000003s)]
*  Both sides know that this has gotten to a really bad place and there's not gonna be a clear-cut military victory [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3570.5600000000004s)]
*  But you have to stop the uae from arming the rsf but associated with that [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3575.36s)]
*  You have to stop this flow of gold from sudan into the uae [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3579.76s)]
*  Because sudan is I believe the fifth largest producer of gold in the world and apparently nearly all of it flows [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3583.6000000000004s)]
*  Through the uae or the russians [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  And now sudan's doing all of its banking at emirati banks you have this weird scenario where [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3593.04s)]
*  They're like there's rsf controlled gold mines and they're flowing all that gold into the uae [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3597.9199999999996s)]
*  But also the government is doing its banking in the uae [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3602.4799999999996s)]
*  So they're sort of like funding both sides of this thing. Yeah, there's complicating things even more [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3605.8399999999997s)]
*  The saudis have an interest in sudan. They get most of their meat and wheat from sudan [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3610.56s)]
*  So they want a compliant regime the egyptians have these deep military ties with sudan [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3614.8799999999997s)]
*  I think uh the current military leader of sudan like went to military academy with general cc [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3619.44s)]
*  and also the egyptians want to make sure that [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3626.4s)]
*  The nile is not messed with in any way because it flows through sudan up into egypt. So [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3629.36s)]
*  Long story short, it's this massive proxy war and I think the challenge for the biden team is tom perriello is trying his best [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3634.16s)]
*  To conduct some diplomacy [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3640.64s)]
*  But he needs to be able to elevate this and get these regional actors to move like the saudis and the uae in egypt [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3642.32s)]
*  And I think those actors probably know those countries probably know that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3648.3199999999997s)]
*  There were higher priorities. Yeah. Yeah constantly and especially with the uae [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3652.24s)]
*  There are other us foreign policy interests that are higher [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3656.9599999999996s)]
*  The only i'd say is I just don't understand the uae they have so much money like [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3659.68s)]
*  They can weather the hit of a couple gold mines or whatever. The thing is that that is their interest here. So [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3664.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, this is the deal that I would like to see [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3670.56s)]
*  You know, i'm not hopeful that don trump's gonna prioritize it [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3673.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm with you, you know, i'd like to see don trump call mbz and say [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3677.2s)]
*  Let's cut this guy off and you know, like if you want to get credit for something [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3680.88s)]
*  Let's try to get credit for this make another part of the abraham accords or something. Yeah. Yeah, sir [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3684.24s)]
*  This could be a historic thing [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3688.24s)]
*  You know you solve this genocide problem that joe biden couldn't like whatever it takes to stop the fighting [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3690.32s)]
*  Just stop this kill. Although this person i was talking to made the point to me that trump will probably want [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3694.88s)]
*  Something for it. You know what I mean? He'll demand like a cut. Yeah. Yeah anyway, um back to gaza man [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3699.44s)]
*  So things in gaza remain horrible over 100 palestinians were reportedly killed in airstrikes over the weekend [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3705.6s)]
*  The washington post had this absolutely gutting report on how at least seven infants have died in gaza [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3711.6s)]
*  By freezing to death due to the cold [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3718.56s)]
*  Trump keeps threatening that all hell will break loose in the middle east if there's a ceasefire and hostage release deal [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3721.2s)]
*  He keeps saying that all hell will break loose. I don't know what that means [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3727.12s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of already broke loose in october 7th. Yeah, how has it been loose? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3729.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, there's the reports that hamas maybe has agreed to release these 34 hostages as part of a follow-on ceasefire deal [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3733.6s)]
*  But then there's other reporting and goes in the times that said that israel says they need more information [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3741.68s)]
*  Uh from hamas about which hostages are alive and how they'd get out. So it is all just unbelievably depressing [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3746.8s)]
*  and tragic and infuriating and [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3754.48s)]
*  Depending on what trump means by all hell will break loose [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3757.12s)]
*  Uh could get a lot worse [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3760.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I I don't first of all it just seems less than as likely that there is going to be like a big [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3763.2s)]
*  Ceasefire for hostages deal. Um, but there there may be something right? Um [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3768.64s)]
*  It may not be all the hostages and it may not be a permanent ceasefire. So there may be something that is more incremental [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3773.6s)]
*  I don't know what he means though because the does he mean the u.s will get involved directly militarily [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3779.2s)]
*  Does because israel can't really unleash any more hell than his life in gaza right now. So [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3784.64s)]
*  um, it does seem like [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3790.08s)]
*  I I think what I take from his message may be more to the other regional players [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3792.4s)]
*  because he you know qatar and and and other egypt and [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3797.84s)]
*  Like I want this done by the time I get in and you guys have to deliver it for me, you know [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3802.48s)]
*  So I think he's probably just trying to brush back [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3807.04s)]
*  Those countries but ultimately we as we've seen it's really just two two voices here [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3810.88s)]
*  It's it's netanyahu and and hamas and we frankly don't even know [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3815.84s)]
*  What hamas is kind of command structure is for this anymore. I think it's like sinwar's brother [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3819.68s)]
*  Yeah, do they know where all the hostages are like there's some questions there [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3824.0s)]
*  We'll see but I mean I I I see that threat is more just like at everybody else to get their shit together [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3828.3199999999997s)]
*  But I think they've been trying. Um [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean you can get it done. It's excruciating. I I do think they are the biden team is try to broker a deal [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3836.48s)]
*  It is very hard to read [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3844.08s)]
*  You know some of these quotes by these sort of exit interviews by various senior officials [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3846.08s)]
*  Where there's still this line that only hamas is the whole [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3850.56s)]
*  Nobody's hostage talks when like no is the hostage families don't believe that [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3854.32s)]
*  The last ones to believe it so you're kind of gaslighting the hostage families who are like we we've been briefed by people [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3858.8s)]
*  You had the former minister of defense of israel saying this I mean [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3866.0s)]
*  So [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3869.7599999999998s)]
*  I do think if something happens the people that have incentive to deliver for trump the most are these regional actors like qatar egyptinelli [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3870.96s)]
*  so [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3878.72s)]
*  if it happens watch it happen on like [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3879.68s)]
*  January 20 like carter hostage style, right? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3882.14s)]
*  Like because they want to humiliate biden, right? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3885.12s)]
*  And and by the way hamas probably wants to humiliate biden too, right? And so I think if a deal gets done [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3887.6s)]
*  My guess would be it happens literally like right before or maybe even on inauguration day [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3894.96s)]
*  But that doesn't fix gaza [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3900.0s)]
*  Like it's still just as big a mess the best that'd be great to get the hostages home and hopefully get some aid in [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3902.08s)]
*  but if trump thinks that this is going to go away as a [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3907.6s)]
*  You know quote unquote problem. It's not I think it'll go away in so far as he will ignore it and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3911.2s)]
*  Activists, he will not listen to activists who talk about the humanitarian situation [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3915.98s)]
*  Yeah, and media attention and there will be a long term attention will drift on [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3919.68s)]
*  Yeah, it will lead to extremism and a massive cost down the road that we will all pay for in some way shape [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3923.2799999999997s)]
*  We will all pay for this. We will all this is not. I mean we'll come back to this obviously, but this is not [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3928.72s)]
*  This is not a victory [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3934.7999999999997s)]
*  This is gonna have consequences or not catastrophic moral and others. Um, the big the other big sort of [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3936.48s)]
*  Opportunity or crisis depending how you look at it that trump is inheriting is syria. I think it's more of an opportunity [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3942.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think so frankly so the administration issued this week [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3947.92s)]
*  What's known as a general license exemption that will allow some transactions with the new government in syria for six months in order to [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3950.88s)]
*  Allow the sale and supply of natural gas petroleum electricity and other energy [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3957.44s)]
*  Because they've been obviously suffering from constant blackouts and other massive infrastructure needs the treasury department said that this [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3961.52s)]
*  General license will also apply to other essential services like water and sanitation [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3968.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's basically like a a partial time limited sanctions waiver. It's not a removal of u.s sanctions [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3972.8s)]
*  It's not a lifting of the designation of hts as a terrorist organization [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3978.64s)]
*  It's just kind of a half measure that is trying to help a little bit in the near term [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3983.12s)]
*  But mostly punting the decision to trump [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3987.44s)]
*  Um, so that's one big policy update when it comes to sort of us policy towards syria [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3989.92s)]
*  The other thing that I think is worth noting is this interview you flagged then which was with [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3994.64s)]
*  This close aide and former. Oh, yeah chief for bashar al-assad [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=3999.44s)]
*  He talks through some of the details of those last days [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4004.24s)]
*  The best part if you're just an asad hater like we are is that asad went to moscow putin made him wait [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4007.44s)]
*  Two days before giving him a one-hour meeting and then send him back [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4013.04s)]
*  And then as you know asad's in and back in syria watching city after city fall [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4017.3599999999997s)]
*  putin wouldn't take his calls and [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4023.6s)]
*  Would just you know unavailable would not also guarantee to provide support to the iranian military if they came in [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4026.16s)]
*  To save the regime's ass so with friends like these [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4032.4s)]
*  Well, it was really nice to to read that thread and and actually you can see the whole interview if you speak arabic [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4035.84s)]
*  But uh in picture asad sitting there trying to get putin on the phone the moment when asad realized it was all over [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4042.32s)]
*  That I would have liked a go pro in the room. That would be good to see [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4048.56s)]
*  I will say on the the general license is is a classic washington half measure [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4052.08s)]
*  I've been involved in general licenses in the past because the problem with it is you're keeping the sanctions in place [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4056.08s)]
*  You're just saying we are going to provide a license for anybody to do these things related to these we do this on cuba because [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4062.08s)]
*  We couldn't get congress to lift the embargo. We did these licenses for certain things [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4069.2s)]
*  The the problem with that is that nobody will invest in syria the business because yeah [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4074.48s)]
*  Because they still see a sanction and they're like well, why the fuck would we invest here if in six months? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4079.76s)]
*  This could go back to being sanctioned. They're still technically sanctioned. You're just saying I can do this stuff [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4084.56s)]
*  So what this will allow is you saw some shipments from katar and turkey, which who seem to be the closest governments to hts [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4089.12s)]
*  Allowing for electricity and fuel and stuff like that to get in so it'll be good [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4097.04s)]
*  To kind of meet immediate needs around things like energy [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4101.76s)]
*  But it's not going to allow for you know investment and reconstruction essentially to go forward that requires lifting the sanctions [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4105.2s)]
*  And punting that to trump. I mean, I don't know why you wouldn't again. I know hts is flawed [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4112.0s)]
*  There's some bad characters associated with it. There's some tensions happening within the opposition [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4117.04s)]
*  My whole approach is this has always been lift the sanctions try to get the best bet to get people in there [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4122.56s)]
*  To stabilize situation start to rebuild and if you start to see creepy behavior [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4129.2s)]
*  You can sweat everything go in place tomorrow. You can just take the existing sanctions and just reactivate them [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4133.2s)]
*  So I would rather lift them, but this is better than nothing. Yeah, it's better than nothing [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4139.6s)]
*  I mean, I think the reason you wouldn't lift them is [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4143.76s)]
*  Political risk political risk and I guess leverage, you know, like like they they would probably argue [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4146.56s)]
*  That you need to incentivize good behavior by hts over time [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4152.96s)]
*  But I don't know like they're never gonna be perfect like no [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4156.96s)]
*  Like what government what government and and the world like doesn't do things we don't like I mean you you have to allow for [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4159.84s)]
*  Flaws in this government. It's better than asad. Yeah, i'd like to see better than asad work out [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4166.24s)]
*  Rather than it be another civil war because they can't fucking do anything because they are sanctioned [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4171.44s)]
*  i've seen some people argue that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4177.04s)]
*  uh this outcome the brittleness of the [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4179.2s)]
*  Syrian military and regime generally is you know an indication that sanctions worked. I'm not really sure that's at all true [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4182.8s)]
*  I I think it's hard to syrian people while the by asad set up a massive drug production and captecon operation [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4190.16s)]
*  Is someone's government? Yeah someone who's there when the sanctuary was put in place [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4196.0s)]
*  So I would have an interest in me like oh look what we did worked [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4198.96s)]
*  No, it had nothing to do with that [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4201.44s)]
*  Like he was making the the rest of the country suffered and he's making money on some weird amphetamine trades [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4202.88s)]
*  Yeah billions dollars off the captecon [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4209.04s)]
*  Um, finally ben there's one thing I think biden does deserve a lot of credit for which is the pentagon announced [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4211.04s)]
*  I think this was monday metal freedom to ralph floren [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4216.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny the pentagon gave that away [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4219.6s)]
*  Uh, they announced that they moved 11 and many prisoners to oman this week from gitmo to oman [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4222.879999999999s)]
*  Which now brings down the total number of those detained at gitmo to 15 [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4229.36s)]
*  It's this I know it's the smallest of gitmo population has ever been [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4232.879999999999s)]
*  It's down from 40 detainees at the start of the biden administration [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4236.24s)]
*  This deal itself [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4239.599999999999s)]
*  Uh has been years in the making it sounds like though per usual [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4241.12s)]
*  Congress stepped in to block it [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4244.639999999999s)]
*  I guess they had a plane on the runway in like 2023 and congress fucked it up and kept these guys in detention [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4246.24s)]
*  Oman look, this is an imperfect solution oman had 28 detainees [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4252.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh took in 28 detainees years ago and they expelled them last year. People are understandably upset about that [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4256.64s)]
*  But I think like the war in afghanistan [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4264.16s)]
*  Gitmo is a mess that biden inherited [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4266.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4269.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm just going to give him credit for doing everything he can to close it down because it is a stain on our justice system our [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4269.68s)]
*  Military our intelligence community [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4276.0s)]
*  It's a colossal waste of money staying on us in the in the obama administration for fucking up the politics and not getting this thing [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4277.76s)]
*  Closed obviously congress is the reason for that they passed laws that made it impossible to transfer people to the u.s [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4283.6s)]
*  Or you know the military? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4288.8s)]
*  Uh the the military justice system was a disaster and we weren't allowed to use article three courts to prosecute prisoners [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4290.8s)]
*  There's a whole backstory. We don't need to I know I know but uh good for biden for for starting to move to get these guys [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4297.84s)]
*  good for biden [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4303.360000000001s)]
*  uh [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4304.96s)]
*  The absurdity of there being 15 people in this prison that we spend like hundreds of millions of dollars like half a billion [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4305.76s)]
*  You know just just to stick it to brock obama like like brock obama hasn't even been president in eight years [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4310.64s)]
*  I can't think of another reason that lindsey graham and all these goons these aging terrorists down there are not [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4317.52s)]
*  So I mean it was always absurd that we couldn't move them to a supermax prison in the united states because what they're going to [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4323.6s)]
*  Bust out like chloe chic mohammed's gonna like run through the wall like the thing or something [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4328.64s)]
*  This is about politics and it's about sticking it to obama obama said he closed it [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4333.120000000001s)]
*  It's so stupid that we're still doing this eight years later [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4337.280000000001s)]
*  But it's good like the the lower that number gets the more absurd this whole proposition [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4340.72s)]
*  Is in the first place that we sold we're spending half a billion dollars just just to keep a prison open in cuba [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4346.400000000001s)]
*  To make some point which i've even lost track of like what the point is we're making [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4353.120000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the point is either [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4356.96s)]
*  I mean, I think the challenge is that you have you know a handful of actual terrorists who did bad things and our ability [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4358.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're chloe chic mohammed. Yeah. Yeah ksm there and we can't prosecute these guys because a lot of them are tortured [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4364.88s)]
*  Because the military commission system is a flawed disaster and we can't use article three courts [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4371.2s)]
*  But then there were a bunch of guys there. Why can't we use article three? That's what's so stupid [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4376.4s)]
*  I don't know well, well in part because you can't transfer them to the u.s [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4379.76s)]
*  Well, but look this is one of those things where I was thinking about this recently because it is true [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4382.24s)]

*  We've got plenty of prisons in the u.s [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4413.84s)]
*  Or in other u.s territories and like we're just going to move these people like like it's crazy how much [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4415.92s)]
*  Time has been put in by democratic lawyers and the obama and biden administration to negotiate these transfer deals to places like oman [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNLUi3YvS08&t=4421.52s)]
