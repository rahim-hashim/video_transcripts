# Bashar al-Assad Complains About Fleeing to Moscow on Telegram After Defeat in Syria
**Pod Save the World:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg)
*  Welcome to Pod Day of the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1.84s)]
*  Ben, less than a month until we're no longer under the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2.88s)]
*  nuclear umbrella of Joe Biden's administration. How are we feeling? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=6.8s)]
*  It feels like it's already here though. Is Joe Biden still president? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=11.36s)]
*  He's not out there, but he's still in charge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  He's still in charge, I guess. We'll find out on January 20th just how much it feels differently. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=16.88s)]
*  It's interesting watching Trump do all these events without any of the responsibility. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=24.16s)]
*  He still can comment on things like drones in New Jersey. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=30.88s)]
*  He's just a guy online offering an opinion, not the president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=34.8s)]
*  You know what's so annoying about him and his supporters is they do that even when he's in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=38.4s)]
*  charge. Everything he does is great and they're proud of him, but anytime something bad happens, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=41.92s)]
*  they blame the deep states on how he's not responsible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=46.8s)]
*  Well, it drives me nuts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=49.2s)]
*  It drives me absolutely nuts. I know this is our last show of the year. I'm sad about it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=50.32s)]
*  It's quite a year. What a year. Who won the year? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=56.4s)]
*  Not us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=61.04s)]
*  Good guys or bad guys? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=61.36s)]
*  Not us. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=62.16s)]
*  I would say bad guys. Also, Ben, I think you have an important [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=62.72s)]
*  correction you have to make at the top here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=66.96s)]
*  This is the most painful thing I've ever done in Paz de la World, which is I need to apologize [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=68.64s)]
*  to Met's nation, Met's family out there, and my exuberance over the Juan Soto signing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=72.8s)]
*  You call them a five tool player and he stops to film me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=79.68s)]
*  He's a five tool player. I stand by that, but then I rattled off our growing Dominican contingent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=81.28s)]
*  and mistakenly included Puerto Rican superstar, Francisco Landor, hero of my two daughters. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=87.12s)]
*  So I just want to apologize for that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=93.92s)]
*  I think the people will forgive you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=95.84s)]
*  Yeah. I was just so excited about Soto and just got wrapped up in the moment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=98.08s)]
*  We just need to get some stock tips from Steve Cohen because he usually pays a guy who's got [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=102.0s)]
*  some info that can help you make some money. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=106.16s)]
*  I just accept the stewardship of Steve Cohen entirely. If there's any hypocrisy in that, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=108.4s)]
*  I'm willing to live with it because I need some nice things in life and a very expensive [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=113.36s)]
*  New York Met's roster is about as good as it gets right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  You know what they say. It's like, you know how everyone hates Congress, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  but they like their congressmen? We hate hedge fund guys, but you like your hedge fund guy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=124.4s)]
*  We hate hedge fund billionaires until they buy your sports team [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=127.2s)]
*  and start paying $750 million for five tool players. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=130.16s)]
*  That's so cool. We got a great show to close out the year for you guys. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to talk about the latest from the new government in Syria, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=137.52s)]
*  as well as what Bashar al-Assad is up to. He's sending little notes on Telegram, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  I believe, checking in with everybody. We're talking about how the Biden team is handling [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  all of this change in the Middle East. We're also going to check in on Trump's national security [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  picks, see how they're doing in the Senate and talk to you guys about some new opportunities [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  for corruption. If you want to bribe someone, they'll do the latest from Gaza and why Israel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  and Ireland are in a diplomatic spat. More on the fallout from the attempted coup and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=163.84s)]
*  martial law declaration in South Korea, the official collapse of Germany's government, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=168.32s)]
*  why things are not looking great for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau up in Canada. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=172.96s)]
*  And then we will check in on everyone's favorite member of the royal family, Prince Andrew. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=177.44s)]
*  The pillar of integrity there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=182.08s)]
*  Integrity, upstanding. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=184.96s)]
*  Some lists there. I mean, there's no shortage of events. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=187.36s)]
*  Yeah. I cut a couple of things too. We had a Georgia thing all prepped to the country and I [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=190.32s)]
*  just like, I ran out of time. We'll get back at it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=194.64s)]
*  We'll get back to it. And then Ben, you're going to hear my interview with Leila Milana Allen, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  she's a special correspondent for PBS NewsHour. The last time listeners heard her on the show, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=199.84s)]
*  she was reporting from Beirut as it was being bombed by the Israeli military. Today, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  she called in from Aleppo, Syria. She'd been all around Syria over the last week or so. We talked [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  about what she's been seeing and hearing. We talked about the new government, what an [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=218.4s)]
*  accountability and reconciliation process might look like in Syria. She's actually been to some [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=223.12s)]
*  of these prisons and intelligence detention sites where people were tortured and seen dead bodies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=227.68s)]
*  Anyway, and we also talked about what the average Syrian person wants to see and expects to see [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  from the West in terms of support for Syria going forward. So really powerful, amazing reporting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=241.6s)]
*  from her and great conversation. Yeah, one serious point I'd just make, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=248.0s)]
*  because I've been consuming a lot of the reporting from people like Leila the last couple of days. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=251.52s)]
*  And with Trump suing Anseltzer, ABC, it's easy to shit on the media, but man, these are the people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=255.68s)]
*  that are showing us what's happening in the world at great risk to themselves. So remind yourself [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=265.52s)]
*  that the quote unquote media isn't just podcasters and pollsters. It is people like Leila that are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=270.4s)]
*  out on the ground telling stories that we would have no idea about if it weren't for journalists. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=276.96s)]
*  At great personal risk. You could run into the wrong person in Syria at any time. Things could [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=281.2s)]
*  happen in Beirut, but she's a total badass. And I'm really, really grateful for the time, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=286.64s)]
*  because she was talking to us like 1130 via a 3G WhatsApp connection. And you're like, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=291.76s)]
*  I'm just a pampered little shit in LA and these people are doing the hard work and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  we're grateful for them. Just like my Amazon arrow is not working well enough on my speed test on my [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=300.08s)]
*  internet. Where's my postmates? All right, then let's talk about the latest from Syria. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=305.04s)]
*  So the rebel leaders there continue to do and say all the things that people in Washington and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=311.12s)]
*  think tanks and also, as you mentioned last week, like minorities in Syria want them to say. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=317.6s)]
*  Jelani, the leader of HTS who has dropped his nom de guerre as one does and is now going by Ahmed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=322.0s)]
*  Alshara, but we'll call him Jelani for ease. He said they are going to dissolve and disarm rebel [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=327.36s)]
*  factions in Syria and create a real army. The interim prime minister said they're taking [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=332.96s)]
*  applications for a police force. Jelani is taking lots of meetings with foreign delegations. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=336.96s)]
*  According to the FT, officials from France, Germany and the UK all have visited or will visit [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=342.0s)]
*  Damascus this week. The former HTS leaders have ditched their military uniforms in favor of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=347.44s)]
*  civilian clothes when they're doing meetings with foreign journalists. Jelani did a big sit down [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=353.2s)]
*  with I think eight or nine reporters and during that conversation said, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=358.16s)]
*  Syria is tired of wars and we want to build a state and institutions away from conflicts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=361.68s)]
*  He also tried to reassure minority groups. He criticized Israel for taking more territory in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=367.04s)]
*  the Golan Heights, but the New York Times, which had a reporter in the meeting, made the point that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=371.6s)]
*  they characterized his comments as, not a tirade against Israel, but by calling the moves a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  violation of the 1974 armistice agreement between the two countries. So he didn't go on some like [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=383.36s)]
*  diatribe against the Zionist oppressors. He was just like, hey, we got an agreement with these guys. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=388.0s)]
*  They're violating it. And his family is from the Golan Heights that Israel annexed. So, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=392.64s)]
*  he's showing some restraint there. I think Abu Ghulani means from the Golan. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=398.72s)]
*  Yeah. So in this conversation, he was also critical of Iran, less critical of Russia. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=402.88s)]
*  Interesting tea leaves there. That said, there's recent satellite imagery that shows the Russian [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  military packing up their equipment, withdrawing staff and equipment from its base in Syria. So, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=414.32s)]
*  who knows what that Russian presence will look like going forward, but interesting to see them [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=418.88s)]
*  leaving, but also the HTS guys being a little less hard on Russia. Jelani called on the US and other [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=423.2s)]
*  countries to remove sanctions on Syria and to delist HTS as a terrorist group. Assad also made [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=429.2s)]
*  his first public statements and is getting toppled and pushed out of Syria. In it, he claims that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=434.24s)]
*  actually he only left Syria after Moscow requested that the base he was at be evacuated back to Russia. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  But then he goes on and talks about how brave he has been for all these years. It's quite pathetic. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  Ben, last week we saw, right when we were recording, you and I were talking offline, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=450.08s)]
*  I think about how Biden's secretary of state and national security advisor were going to the Middle [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  East. I figured one of them was going to dip into Syria for some meetings. It doesn't seem to have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=458.32s)]
*  happened. The State Department says they've been in contact with HTS, but there's not been an in [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=463.44s)]
*  person meeting. They also haven't relaxed any sanctions. I guess just my question again to you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=467.76s)]
*  is why not? Why not have Biden lob in a call to Jelani? There's this historic opportunity now [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=472.96s)]
*  to shape what's happening in Syria, to stick it to the Russians, to stick it to the Iranians, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=479.84s)]
*  lob in a call. Trump would do it. Trump would do it in a heartbeat. What is the downside? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=484.96s)]
*  There's no downside. There's an absurdity to the current situation. There is currently still a US [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=489.44s)]
*  $10 million rewards for justice bounty on Jelani. So what, if the UN official or the British official [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  makes a citizen's arrest, we're going to give that person $10 million? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, those reporters in the round table just grab them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=506.88s)]
*  Yeah. If you want to win on the stupidity of American foreign policy, it's that, that still [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=509.2s)]
*  exists and someone didn't just get rid of that. And the reality is these people are, we talked [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=515.6s)]
*  about this last week, so I don't harp on it, but essentially all we're doing is obstructing a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  transition that can take place, obstructing assistance getting in. We are designating people [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=528.08s)]
*  as terrorists who, whatever their roots, if you listen to anybody in Syria and you look at the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=532.72s)]
*  scale of the disappearances, just saved tens of thousands of lives by emptying those prisons. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=537.6s)]
*  These people, whatever we think about them, and it doesn't mean that they're not going to do things [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=542.96s)]
*  we don't like. It doesn't mean that they don't have associations that are troubling that we may [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=547.12s)]
*  need to monitor with time, but let's wipe this slate clean. You have to account for changes in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=550.88s)]
*  circumstance. And if ever there is a change in circumstance, this is it, to delist HDS, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  to lift sanctions, and to try to make this transition work. The other thing that is painful [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  to watch is that Syria, the biggest conflict risks it faces are from external actors. So you've got [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=569.36s)]
*  Israel still bombing things in Syria, claiming territory. You've got the Turks threatening [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=575.04s)]
*  the Kurds in the North, the US trying to broker an agreement there. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  Don't leave us out. We're bombing Syria, too. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=583.44s)]
*  We're bombing Syria with ISIS. I mean, at a certain point, it's just you got to, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=584.72s)]
*  what you'd like to see is these external forces withdrawing from Syria, making agreements to not [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=589.6s)]
*  target each other's proxies and to kind of let a transition actually take place. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=594.96s)]
*  And all the US talking points are, we want a transition that a Syria owns, Syrian-led. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=598.96s)]
*  Well, they can't own it and lead it if they're sanctioned and designated, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=605.12s)]
*  and multiple countries are fighting in their territory. So again, there's reason to be careful. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=609.52s)]
*  There's reason to reserve some enthusiasm. There's reason to say, if we see a return to any [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=615.6s)]
*  kind of extremism, there's designations that can come back. But I'd be wiping this clean. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=622.72s)]
*  These guys, just compare how these guys are acting to how the Taliban acted when they [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=627.6s)]
*  got into Kabul. It's night and day. And so we have to allow for that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=631.36s)]
*  Yeah. And let's just then, so obviously this is going to be Trump's problem pretty soon. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=635.12s)]
*  He weighed in on the situation in Syria during a press conference on money. Let's listen to a clip. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=639.6s)]
*  Now, the one of the sides has been essentially wiped out, but [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=645.12s)]
*  nobody knows who the other side is. But I do. You know who it is? Turkey. Okay. Turkey is the one [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=648.24s)]
*  behind it. He's a very smart guy. They've wanted it for thousands of years, and he got it. And those [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  people that went in are controlled by Turkey. And that's okay. It's another way to fight. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=662.4s)]
*  But no, I don't think that I want to have our soldiers killed, but I don't think that will [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=670.4s)]
*  happen now anyway, because the one side's been decimated. Turkey. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=675.52s)]
*  You talk to a kid who learned about something for the first time and is excited to show off [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=682.64s)]
*  to the teacher about it. I assume he's getting intelligence briefings. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=686.88s)]
*  Yeah. And it is an entirely overly simplistic thing to just say, Turkey. Turkey. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=690.0s)]
*  Yes, Turkey has a lot of influence with the HDS. They support them in Idlib. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=696.64s)]
*  They have ambitions to have influence in Syria. But if you think that's all that happened [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=700.32s)]
*  when you're watching the scenes out of Syria, these guys are Syrian, and they clearly want to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  govern Syria. And this is what's coming. A very simplistic view of the world as this kind of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=713.7600000000001s)]
*  chessboard between some big powers and not a lot of nuance in the understanding of different [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=721.84s)]
*  factions instead of Syria. Yeah. He was excited that he knew the answer. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=727.6s)]
*  He was excited that he knew that Turkey shared a border with Syria. But also it was weird the way [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  he framed it. He's like, yeah, I don't want US soldiers dying in Syria, but now I don't think [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=734.48s)]
*  they will because Turkey is controlling this faction and I don't think they'll attack us. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=738.32s)]
*  I don't know. It just made me once again feel like I don't really know what he's going to do [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=742.88s)]
*  with US troops in Syria or how he's thinking about this. Obviously has this kind of nationalist, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=747.2s)]
*  America first, bring them all home, not our problem mentality towards almost everything, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=752.8s)]
*  including Syria because he tweeted as much the other day. But I don't know. There was a little [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=758.0s)]
*  ambiguity there I thought. Well, I think he's always shaped by something that happened before [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=761.52s)]
*  that involves him. And he wanted to take these troops out of Syria the first time, and there's [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=766.4799999999999s)]
*  a lot of uproar in the Republican Party and he didn't. The challenge is right now, those US [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=771.8399999999999s)]
*  troops are kind of the last thing standing between Turkey and what could be a massacre [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  of Kurdish forces that have helped us fight ISIS. And so what he needs to be doing is negotiating [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=787.6s)]
*  with Turkey to have a place for the Kurds inside of Syria. And there's been these negotiations [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  between HDS and the Kurds about how could the Kurds have some autonomy within a new Syria and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=800.0s)]
*  how could they feel comfortable being a part of a new governance structure. And that should [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=804.96s)]
*  involve diplomacy with Turkey. Yeah, we don't want the US and Turkey to get in a shooting war over [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=812.64s)]
*  northern Syria. That should require diplomacy. It's just, do we think Trump is going to do that? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. So I wonder if some advisors would be like, sir, you have an unbelievable [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=826.1600000000001s)]
*  opportunity to permanently take a whack at the Iranians and the Russians and keep them down [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=830.0s)]
*  and solidify our power in the Middle East, sir. Beecher chest, sir, sir, sir. We'll see if he'll [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=835.92s)]
*  take it. Ben, we wonder- Reduce of sir, by the way. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=841.2s)]
*  Thank you. We talked in the last couple episodes about Assad and our hope that he's living somewhere [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=844.08s)]
*  really horrible in Moscow. That's probably not the case. The Financial Times reported that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=849.68s)]
*  Assad's central bank airlifted $250 million in cash to Moscow in 2018 and 2019. They said that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=854.64s)]
*  Assad's extended family bought at least 20 luxury apartments in Moscow during that time using a [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=862.88s)]
*  complex set of companies and loan arrangements. And as recently as May, 2022, Assad's maternal [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=867.76s)]
*  cousin and sort of a member of the Syrian intelligence was established a property company [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=874.96s)]
*  in Moscow established by some other relatives. So that's probably just the tip of the iceberg [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=880.4s)]
*  when it comes to all of the money that Assad has eluded from the country and repositioned in Russia. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=885.36s)]
*  Now, the question I guess is whether Putin says, oh, that's actually mine. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=895.6s)]
*  Or lets him live off it. But- Yeah. I just don't know. If you're betting on the over-under [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=895.92s)]
*  for how long Assad is around, I'd be taking the under because he's not going to be able to go [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  anywhere else other than Russia pretty much. And what uses he to the Russians? I mean, that's the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=907.12s)]
*  thing. I mean, sure, they took him in like the US took in the Shah or something, but [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=914.48s)]
*  I can't imagine what use he is because he has no popular support in Syria. So it's not like he could [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=920.72s)]
*  rebuild a base to return to Syria and restore Russian influence. He's the most loathed human [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=925.28s)]
*  being in Syria. So he's just going to be cooling his heels, I guess, in Moscow or wherever they [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=931.84s)]
*  are. Yeah. Some parody account of RT announced that he was starting a podcast. That was very funny. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=937.6s)]
*  That's it for the Ben and I on Syria. But later in the interview, you're going to hear me and Leila [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=944.64s)]
*  talk a lot more about this. We also talk about the search for Austin Tice, the US journalist who's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=948.32s)]
*  been missing in Syria since 2012. And Austin Tice's parents request to the Israelis, to Netanyahu, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=954.0s)]
*  to stop bombing parts of Damascus where they think that Austin Tice might be held. They're [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=961.84s)]
*  worried that like the Israeli could be killing. Yeah, no, they could. They're bombing military [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=966.96s)]
*  facilities. And that is if he's alive, that's a place that he could very well be held. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=972.08s)]
*  Oh my God. All right, let's check in on Trump's national security nominees, Ben. So the Hill had [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  a good piece about Tulsi Gabbard struggles to woo senators on Capitol Hill as she tries to secure [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=981.6s)]
*  votes to become the director of national intelligence. One source described her as, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  a little shallow and an anonymous Republican senator described her meetings as BS sessions. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=990.64s)]
*  These are people who ostensibly may support her. Tulsi, she had a challenging path for this job, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=996.72s)]
*  given her fondness for Assad and her total lack of qualifications for the job. But we'll see if Trump [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1002.24s)]
*  could kind of bully her, the votes. On Monday, he not at all subtly suggested that he would support [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1007.28s)]
*  primary challengers for senators who oppose his people. I assume she's among the list of folks he [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1014.64s)]
*  would fight for that way. Pete Hegseth, the nominee to be secretary of defense, he seemed to be in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1019.92s)]
*  very big trouble until the MAGA base started intimidating Republican senators. New York Times [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1026.0s)]
*  had a great story about the pressure campaign against Iowa Republican Joni Ernst. She's a combat [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1030.32s)]
*  veteran. She's a survivor of sexual assault, who dared to suggest that Pete Hegseth's lack of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1035.04s)]
*  experience and the allegations of sexual assault and basically near constant drunkenness might be [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1040.96s)]
*  a problem for him as secretary of defense. But, you know, it seems like Pete's very much on track [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1046.88s)]
*  to get confirmed now. The crew over at Morning Joe did a segment where they looked at some of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1052.96s)]
*  what Pete Hegseth wrote in his book about the military. Let's listen, Ben. Hegseth writes, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1058.64s)]
*  America will decline and die. A national divorce will ensue. Outnumbered freedom lovers will fight [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1065.2s)]
*  back. The military and police, both bastions of freedom-loving patriots, will be forced [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1072.96s)]
*  to make a choice. It will not be good. Yes, there will be some form of civil war. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1080.08s)]
*  In another section, Hegseth writes that our present moment is much like the 11th century. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1087.2s)]
*  We do not want to fight, but like our fellow Christians 1,000 years ago, we must [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1094.48s)]
*  arm yourself metaphorically, intellectually, physically. Our fight is not with guns yet. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1101.2s)]
*  Little civil war crusade, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Excited? This is clearly the most problematic of the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1109.84s)]
*  nominees. I mean, if I were to focus on one out of all of them, it would definitely be Hegseth. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  It is, you know, the most important of the agencies. And let's be clear, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump is going to do a lot of things that are going to trigger a lot of us. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1124.0s)]
*  Two of the kind of existential things are the transformation politicization of the US military [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1127.68s)]
*  and the transformation politicization of the Justice Department. Those are different order [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1134.08s)]
*  threats than even a weirdo like Tulsa Gabbard being DNI. And so having a guy that has had, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1138.0s)]
*  you know, these credible claims of sexual assault, credible allegations of being drunk all the time, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1145.52s)]
*  being drunk all the time, is writing openly about civil war, defended war criminals. These [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1151.36s)]
*  are just the things, you know, we all know about. This is not the person you want leading a nearly [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1157.04s)]
*  trillion dollar enterprise that is in the chain of command, that has to respond on the dime to [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1162.32s)]
*  international crises at a time of great power conflict that is in the nuclear chain of command. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1168.32s)]
*  It's just totally irresponsible to even be entertaining this. And the fact that somebody [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1174.0s)]
*  like Joni Ernst, who clearly didn't want to support Hex F and you know, her she withdrew [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1179.68s)]
*  support and might have been existential to his nomination. Well, that Steve Bannon and some [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1184.4s)]
*  people can, you know, go on. Charlie Kirk gives little right wing nuts, podcaster types. Just [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1188.8s)]
*  scream on podcasts and all of a sudden, like she's in line, should be terrifying to people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1194.48s)]
*  And they target her, right? Well, a bunch of male senators hide behind her. Yeah, she's a [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1198.24s)]
*  combat veteran. She's a sexual assault survivor. And these fucking cowards hide behind her being [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  kind of the public face of concern about things you should be concerned about. Like this guy has [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1208.24s)]
*  credible sexual assault allegations. He's drunk all the time. He has no relevant experience. He's [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1214.16s)]
*  never managed an organization of more than like 10 people. And he's going to run the Department [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1218.4s)]
*  of Defense and oversee what three million, nearly three million employees. Yeah. And this is what [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1222.48s)]
*  Bannon does understand is that the reason they want to get him in is to prove that they call all the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1228.24s)]
*  shots that the Senate Republicans, John Thune, the Senate Majority Leader are meaningless, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1233.44s)]
*  that they're just rubber stamps for Trump. So this is a proxy for how the Senate Republican [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1237.76s)]
*  caucus will operate in national security and politics generally. And Bannon says that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1243.04s)]
*  He says it because he knows it. I listen all the time. And one of the things that, you know, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1246.8s)]
*  there's that Utah guy that was in the right place on Gates. I don't even know his name, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1251.04s)]
*  the new Utah Republican Senator. So this is the guy who was elected to replace Romney. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1254.64s)]
*  I mentioned this guy for the simple reason that, you know, this guy doesn't come up for election [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1260.16s)]
*  until two years after Donald Trump's term ends. You know, like Trump is not forever. And if these [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1264.32s)]
*  Republicans, you know, are willing to basically risk the entire United States military and the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  Pentagon and a trillion dollar budget because they're afraid of being criticized on Charlie [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1275.84s)]
*  Kirk's podcast, why are you in public office? We've said this before, but you have real power [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  here as Senate Republicans. And ultimately it's on them. It's on the Republicans to see how much [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  they're going to allow Trump to crash the car, drive the car drunk, quite literally in the access [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1292.64s)]
*  case versus whether they have any institutional prerogative. So watch that of all the nominations. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1297.76s)]
*  I like to think that Cash Patel would be raising these concerns, but it doesn't seem to be. Cash [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1304.16s)]
*  seems to be coasting through. Yeah. Let's get to Cash. John Curtis is the new incoming Republican [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1309.68s)]
*  from Utah. I did Google it. Don't apologize. Household name. Adios, Mitt Romney. Yeah. So [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1315.0400000000002s)]
*  we've been watching Cash. Like you said, he's been named to lead the FBI. As you said, it doesn't [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1320.32s)]
*  seem like he's facing any real headwinds. The New York Times dug into some of the lies he told about [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  Benghazi. They are as follows. Patel has repeatedly said, both verbally on podcasts and in print in a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1331.6799999999998s)]
*  book he wrote, that he was quote, leading the prosecution's efforts at main justice in [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1338.08s)]
*  Washington. So leading the prosecution of the Benghazi suspects. However, that's not true. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  He was a prosecutor in the counterterrorism section of DOJ. He did work on the Benghazi [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1347.36s)]
*  investigation, but only in support of the prosecutors who were leading that prosecution [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1351.68s)]
*  at the DC US attorney's office. The Times also notes that Patel left DOJ six months before the [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1355.6s)]
*  first Benghazi case went to trial. It's tough to leave that effort if you're not there. He also [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1361.68s)]
*  reportedly lied about being asked to join the trial team. Cash has complained that Obama's DOJ [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1366.24s)]
*  only prosecuted one guy and it took a pass on the others for political reasons. The Times says, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1372.0s)]
*  in fact, the prosecutors had filed sealed complaints against over a dozen militants that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1377.68s)]
*  were just kept secret. And then weirdly, Cash has said on podcasts that the military had quote, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1382.08s)]
*  rolled up 19 attackers when even today the US government has only been able to capture two of [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1386.56s)]
*  them. And I think they prosecuted one at least, maybe both, just because it's very tough to operate [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1393.2s)]
*  in Eastern Libya. So we could keep going about all the kind of fabrications here, but this at a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1399.4399999999998s)]
*  minimum raises questions about his credibility. Yeah. And when you hear things like that, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1406.2399999999998s)]
*  I don't know what's more alarming, Tommy. Is it more alarming that he just makes stuff up or [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1412.8s)]
*  that he might actually believe these things that he says that aren't true? Because he seems like [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1419.52s)]
*  one of those guys that may actually talk himself into grandeur. Either way, you're putting this [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1423.6s)]
*  person who's not at all qualified in charge of the entire law enforcement apparatus in the United [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1430.32s)]
*  States of America and it doesn't seem to be raising any red flags. And just because Pete Hegseth, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  there's alcohol and women involved, it seems like that's more- [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1444.08s)]
*  It's easier to report on. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1447.4399999999998s)]
*  It's easier to report on, but the kind of complete lack of qualification to see seemingly some of the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1448.24s)]
*  more normie Republicans like Tom Tillis from North Carolina, who's up in a couple of years being like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1453.6s)]
*  he's going to reform the FBI. What does that even mean? Reform it to do what? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  How? Yeah. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1462.24s)]
*  There's nothing here about making the FBI more effective in prosecuting, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1463.12s)]
*  doing counter-terrorism or counterintelligence or counter-narcotics. It's wholly about making the [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1469.28s)]
*  FBI an extension of Donald Trump's political interests. There's no other reason to select [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1474.32s)]
*  Cash Patel. But that one, like I said, I think Hegseth, there's a chance he's not confirmed. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  Cash Patel, it seems like that ship is getting ready to sail. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1487.04s)]
*  It's sailing, that's for sure. Also, listeners know we try to keep an eye on [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1491.28s)]
*  current and future foreign corruption opportunities by the Trump regime. It is a full-time job. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1496.24s)]
*  Along those lines, last week, Eric Trump announced a new Trump Tower in Jeddah, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1502.16s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. During his first term, Trump said he would avoid foreign deals such as this to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1506.88s)]
*  avoid conflicts of interest. This time, apparently that no longer matters. There's also plans for [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1512.0s)]
*  two Trump developments in Riyadh. They're eyeing a project in Abu Dhabi. This is all in partnership [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1516.96s)]
*  with this real estate company called Dar Global, which Reuters reports is the international arm of [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's Dar Al-Arqan Real Estate Development Company. Again, our Gulf listeners are probably [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1527.12s)]
*  wondering, who do I bribe? Is it Jared Kushner? Is it Steve Woodcoff? Is it Tiffany Trump's father-in-law? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1532.8s)]
*  Is it Don Jr.? Is it Eric? Do I just buy the Trump crypto or do I buy the DJT stock? The truth is, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1538.08s)]
*  I don't know anymore, Ben. It sounds like the Trump org is trying to get back the Trump hotel in DC [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1544.0s)]
*  and lease that back so they can do the rents 50 hotel rooms grift again. I don't have great advice [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1549.4399999999998s)]
*  for all our listeners in the UAE now. It's just going to cost a lot. Did you see Eric Trump in [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1555.6s)]
*  the UAE a few days ago for some crypto conference? No. He's literally there hawking Trump family [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1560.7199999999998s)]
*  cryptocurrencies. Hawk to a coin. Of course they're going to invest in it. Do you think that the [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1567.6s)]
*  missing piece in the Jetta skyline is the Trump Tower? Honestly, yes. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1573.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. But the point is, this is just rank corruption of a sort that we've never seen. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1578.48s)]
*  Again, we spent four years doing a proctology exam on Hunter Biden's pretty hackish influence [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1589.44s)]
*  peddling. Did he try to get something for the big guy or whatever? This is just the President [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1596.72s)]
*  United States' sons going around the world doing deals that are entirely rooted in the fact that [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1603.44s)]
*  he's the President's son that are tally up to billions and billions of dollars. It's just like [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1607.76s)]
*  the sun rising and setting. I believe the FBI informant who lied about Biden taking bribes [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1612.8s)]
*  actually pleaded guilty to lying yesterday. Yes. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1619.52s)]
*  So there's that. Also, Ben, you flagged this one for me. Trump announced his next ambassador [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1622.64s)]
*  Uruguay, Lou Rinaldi, and noted in the announcement that tweet that Lou was a great golfer and will [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1627.28s)]
*  be in a country with some terrific courses. I like that. Did you see though that Nigel Farage [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1632.48s)]
*  was at Mar-a-Lago on Monday and he met with Elon Musk? Yes. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1637.2s)]
*  And that is significant because Elon has decided that he hates Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1640.64s)]
*  the UK, the Labour Party leader. And there's concern that Elon could just decide to do what [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1646.48s)]
*  he did in the US and just dump a couple hundred million dollars into the Reform UK party coffers [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1651.52s)]
*  over in the UK. And all of a sudden you have the rise of this super right-wing party. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1657.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you've already seen Trump and Elon trying to kneecap different people. So they [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1662.08s)]
*  humiliated Trudeau. Seems like that worked. We'll get to that. But this is really interesting because [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1667.6799999999998s)]
*  he's made these noises about giving $100, $200 million to the Reform party, the crazy right-wing [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1675.1999999999998s)]
*  party of Nigel Farage. First of all, that's kind of complicated. They have different laws. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1680.48s)]
*  Well, technically, British political parties are not supposed to receive foreign donations. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1686.96s)]
*  I think what people have seen over the years, including perhaps some Russian oligarchs who [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1691.2s)]
*  gave money to the Tories, that they kind of create these shell companies. And if Elon really wants [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1695.28s)]
*  to get $100 million in the hands of Nigel Farage, you could probably figure out a way to do it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1699.52s)]
*  Boris Johnson is in this mix too. And the question is, Boris wants to be Trump and Elon's friend too. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1703.68s)]
*  Does this money go to the Tories? And Boris, does it go to Nigel Farage and Reform? Either way, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1710.96s)]
*  the notion of an American oligarch just kind of trying to select the leadership of various [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1717.12s)]
*  democracies of a far-right flavor, again, this is something we'll have to watch. But the early [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1722.6399999999999s)]
*  indications are this crowd is going to throw their weight around maximally. And the longer Elon stays [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1730.48s)]
*  tethered to Trump, the more Trump has an unlimited, just like the Gulf sovereign wealth funds are [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1736.32s)]
*  unlimited sources of wealth for him. Elon's an unlimited source of funding for politics in [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1742.24s)]
*  other countries. Yeah. Final Trump thing. He's going to do, by the way, to foreign politicians [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1747.6s)]
*  what he's doing to Republicans. Threatening primaries, same thing. The Tories, I'm going [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1753.04s)]
*  to promote Nigel Farage. He's basically trying to do on a global scale what he's done to the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1758.56s)]
*  Republican party. Wonderful. Last thing Trump related, I don't know if we talked about this, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1762.8s)]
*  but Trump invited Xi Jinping to his inauguration, which I read and I was like, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1767.6s)]
*  it's not going to happen. I guess, kind of who cares? It's weird to only invite the Chinese [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1774.08s)]
*  dictator to your inauguration and no other heads of state. He was asked if he'd invite Zelensky, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1779.6s)]
*  and he's like, no, but he can come if he wants. He just won't have a ticket. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1783.84s)]
*  He'll be in the purple tunnel of doom like we were in 2008. But I was talking to a China expert [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  today who suggested that actually in Beijing, this might've sounded really insulting because [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1792.4s)]
*  Xi Jinping's like, I'm Xi Jinping. I'm up your pier. And the idea that I'm going to sit in the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1799.76s)]
*  crowd like a plebe next to Peter Navarro and Marco Rubio while you get inaugurated and I'm [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1806.5600000000002s)]
*  going to clap for you, get out of here with that shit. And here's the other thing, and maybe this [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1812.8000000000002s)]
*  can be comfort to some of our listeners. This is not forever. Trump has got, this is his last [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1817.52s)]
*  inauguration. He's got four years in office. He'll probably really have two years until [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1823.44s)]
*  hopefully not come what he loses the house of Congress. Xi Jinping, guess what? He's going to [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  be there in four years, barring a health emergency. He might be there in 40. He might be there in 10 [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1832.72s)]
*  years. They're not that impressed. That's the thing is that everybody in this country seems [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1836.48s)]
*  to be caving, whether ABC News or whatever. But these leaders like Xi Jinping are like, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1841.68s)]
*  why would I fucking fly to Washington in middle January to watch Donald Trump give a speech? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  And in 2016, everyone was shocked when Trump won the election. And every country everywhere [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1854.3999999999999s)]
*  was scrambling to figure out who he was, what he believed and how to get to them. And a lot of them [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  found a useful idiot in Jared Kushner. I guess Kushner was actually pretty close or wanted to be [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1865.12s)]
*  close to Henry Kissinger. And so the Chinese would go through him or they'd go through like [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1870.4799999999998s)]
*  Steve Wynn or other businessmen to pass along messages. And they would just kind of like form [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1874.24s)]
*  shop to manipulate Trump. Now he's a totally known quantity. All the like tariff threats are out [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1879.2s)]
*  there. The Chinese are ready. Like they just put a huge trade embargo on the export of these four [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1884.16s)]
*  critical minerals like gallium, germanium, things that our listeners have never ever heard of, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1889.52s)]
*  but are absolutely critical to high tech industries, including I saw a report that [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1894.24s)]
*  the Chinese export ban on critical minerals to the US could disrupt more than a thousand [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1900.24s)]
*  US weapons production systems. Like these guys are ready to play hardball. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1905.76s)]
*  You want to talk about ready. They literally are listening to all of Donald Trump's phone calls. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is a thing that is happening. It is not getting that much attention, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1915.9199999999998s)]
*  but the Chinese hack of the US telecommunications means they have the capacity to listen to all [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1919.52s)]
*  phones in the United States. We know from reporting that Trump and Vance were two of the people [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1924.08s)]
*  targeted. We know that Donald Trump is always on his fucking cell phone. He doesn't need to travel [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1928.32s)]
*  all the way to the United States when he can just listen to the guy's phone calls and get [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1932.72s)]
*  transcripted his phone calls. Trump acts like he's the only one with leverage with these tariffs. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  The Chinese have had eight years to plan for this trade war. They can fuck with supply chains. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1939.76s)]
*  They can fuck. We don't have access. They just did an antitrust investigation into [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1944.8s)]
*  Nvidia. They're going after our big industries. We don't have access to these critical minerals. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1947.84s)]
*  It's not like we can go find other sources. The Chinese have kind of monopoly level control over [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1952.0s)]
*  a lot of things that are fundamental to supply chains. Elon can't make a lot of Teslas without [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1956.72s)]
*  China, right? Apple can't make iPhones. So this is not child's play. I think what will be interesting [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1961.28s)]
*  over the next year is if Trump does push the envelope on things like tariffs, how much are [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1967.2s)]
*  we going to feel it in return? I think a fair amount. Yeah, I think they're ready to counterpunch. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1972.96s)]
*  Before we move on to a couple of foreign issues, Ben, you have a piece out in foreign affairs this [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1976.88s)]
*  week about where Democrats should go in foreign policy. What can we learn? What should we look [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1980.64s)]
*  for? Definitely check it out. I wanted to write about what lessons we should take away from this [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1985.6s)]
*  election, where we should go. I talk about essentially, as we've discussed in this podcast, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1990.7199999999998s)]
*  the rules-based international order that the Biden people were upholding and talking about all time [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=1998.24s)]
*  doesn't exist anymore. There's no going back. The first time around, it was like make Trump a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2003.52s)]
*  one-term president and kind of restore leadership of this rules-based order. The rules-based order [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2009.36s)]
*  is gone. America is not coming back as it used to be. The rest of the world is moving on, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2013.76s)]
*  and Democrats have to adjust to that reality. I talk a bunch about what that means in terms of [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  broad policy and kind of coming back with plans to deal with big issues like climate and technology [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2023.76s)]
*  and great power conflict and putting more diplomacy forward. A couple of things that [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2028.8s)]
*  you might like, Tommy, on these contentious issues like Gaza or like Cuba. This is the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2033.28s)]
*  10th anniversary of the effort to normalize relations with Cuba. Maybe the Democratic [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2038.24s)]
*  Party should do something radical, Tommy, and actually adopt policies that reflect the views [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2043.76s)]
*  of its own constituencies instead of tailoring their views to a small number of pundits and [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2048.24s)]
*  interest groups in Washington. That's one thing. That seems crazy. Then the other thing I talk [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2054.16s)]
*  about is maybe people who work in foreign policy should talk like human beings. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2056.96s)]
*  Oh, I like that. And should not use a bunch of jargon, should not be deeply concerned about [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2061.28s)]
*  things we do nothing about. That the way we talk about foreign policy, the people that run it, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2065.68s)]
*  it seems designed to exclude people. And that Trump may sound stupid or like he's lying, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2071.68s)]
*  but he sounds like a real person. A little more candor, a little more blunt language about world [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  events would be in order, but check it out. I tried to cover a lot of ground and probably the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2082.72s)]
*  first of many credit cores in the years to come. Credit core, I like that. That's that jargon. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. Good hint. Good hint. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2093.36s)]
*  Good detente. All right, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2096.32s)]
*  we're going to talk about Gaza. You guys might have noticed that last week, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2099.84s)]
*  Saudi Arabia was named the host of the 2034 World Cup. Very exciting, Ben. Season two of [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2102.48s)]

*  the wall and prevent this. No, actually exactly what we feared would happen. So if you want to [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2119.68s)]

*  by the end of the week. I think he's angling for a white house job. Finally, if you want to understand [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2163.2s)]

*  you get your podcasts. In Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported last week that Hamas has made [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2186.8s)]
*  a major concession in ceasefire negotiations by saying they would allow the IDF to remain in Gaza [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2191.84s)]
*  on a temporary basis after the fighting stops. According to the AP, what's on the table is a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2197.2000000000003s)]
*  phased agreement. Phase one would be a preliminary ceasefire lasting six to eight weeks that would [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2202.64s)]
*  allow for the exchange of approximately 30 hostages, three or four of whom are dual Israeli [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  U.S. citizens and up to 100 Palestinian prisoners. Then there would also be a massive influx of aid [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2212.24s)]
*  into Gaza. The IDF would move out of some parts of the strip but remain in strategic areas like the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2217.2799999999997s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor, that border region between Gaza and Egypt, and the Netzerim corridor, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2223.2s)]
*  which divides north and south Gaza. Israel's defense minister said they are, quote, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2228.56s)]
*  the closest we've been to a hostage deal since the last deal, that deal very early on that allowed [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2232.4s)]
*  for a limited release of prisoners. And Haaretz quoted a Lebanese newspaper, Al-Aqbar, as saying, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2237.52s)]
*  quote, there is unprecedented willingness to get the deal done on both sides. So Ben, there's a few [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2243.12s)]
*  reasons why that might be right. The Washington Post noted that Hamas is under pressure from [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2248.24s)]
*  Gazans to end the conflict after 14 months and just untold suffering. And as the AP notes, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  Hamas is more isolated than ever since Israel's ceasefire with Hezbollah was reached and Iran has [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2257.84s)]
*  been weakened after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. I should note after reading all of that, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  I saw Axios had a report shitting all over this optimism and quoting a bunch of Israeli officials [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2268.1600000000003s)]
*  saying the gaps are still very wide, so who knows. CIA Director Bill Burns is either in Doha or [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  headed to Doha to negotiate as we speak. Over the weekend, though, Israeli strikes hit several [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2280.7200000000003s)]
*  schools as well as a camp in central Gaza. Among those killed was a cameraman for Al Jazeera. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2285.52s)]
*  There were videos on Twitter from these strikes that were absolutely horrific, the worst things [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2291.44s)]
*  you can ever imagine. And those deaths put the Gaza Health Ministry's death count above 45,000, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2296.24s)]
*  which as we've discussed, I suspect is an undercount. Ben, on Pots of America, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2302.8s)]
*  Monday came out Tuesday, we talked about things we'd like to see Biden do in these last months. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2308.08s)]
*  I said I'd love to see Biden just cut off aid to the war in Gaza, even if Trump turns it back on, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2312.4s)]
*  because why not just try to end this horrific nightmare? But a more limited thing he could do [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2317.04s)]
*  is say to Netanyahu, take this deal, or I will start unilaterally negotiating with Hamas to get [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2323.6800000000003s)]
*  out the Americans by the end of my term. I don't give a shit what you say about it. I mean, the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2329.36s)]
*  fact that we're not negotiating on behalf of just these Americans after 14 months is crazy to me. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2333.76s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So there was a lot of things related to this Gaza policy. I think one reason that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2338.24s)]
*  there is cause for actual optimism is that Bibi wants a ceasefire now. He was clearly as big, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2344.64s)]
*  if not a bigger impediment to a deal than Hamas at times over the last few months. But now that [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2351.9199999999996s)]
*  Trump is coming in, and Trump wants this loose end tied up, now Bibi has a real incentive to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2359.52s)]
*  deliver this for Trump. In a weird way, it's one more humiliation to Biden on the way out the door [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2367.28s)]
*  to wait till the very end of his presidency to say, okay, now we'll do this deal. So I think the [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2374.0800000000004s)]
*  combination of Hamas, yes, being more isolated with what's happened in Hezbollah, and obviously [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2379.6000000000004s)]
*  Gazans want this conflict to end, but also Israel wanting to do this for Trump because they're [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2385.84s)]
*  getting this message over and over publicly and I think privately from the Trump people, like, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2390.6400000000003s)]
*  we want this thing wound up. No, that said, even if this deal happens, and I hope it does, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2394.4s)]
*  and I hope as many hostages get out as possible and hope as much aid gets into Gaza as possible, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2400.08s)]
*  it's not like that's the end of anything. I mean, what's the future of Gaza? Who's going to run [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2404.32s)]
*  Gaza? What's the Israeli presence going to be like? Are they going to resume strikes in Gaza? Are [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2408.1600000000003s)]
*  they going to settle in northern Gaza? Are they going to reoccupy this strip? What happens to the [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2413.04s)]
*  West Bank? I mean, this idea that this is a scorecard and you check it off when this ceasefire for [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2418.1600000000003s)]
*  hostage thing happens is not the kind of reality of what the conflict is. On your list of things [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2423.2s)]
*  that he could do in addition to what you said, I mentioned this, I think, last week, but just to [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2428.96s)]
*  expand on it, the more I think about this, Trump has no incentive to release any information about [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2434.64s)]
*  what the conditions are like in Gaza. Israel has every incentive to suppress the reality of what's [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2444.24s)]
*  happened in Gaza. Things like US assessments of casualties, things like US assessments of the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2451.04s)]
*  scale of destruction in Gaza. Whatever the United States government knows, I would like to see [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2458.56s)]
*  transparency because otherwise, I don't know why, we may never get the truth of what has actually [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2466.48s)]
*  happened in Gaza because between Netanyahu and Trump, there's not a lot of incentive [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2470.8s)]
*  for transparency. If you think I'm being hyperbolic, why has there not been any access [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2477.04s)]
*  to international journalists to Gaza since October 7th? I think it's a great idea. I would love to see [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2482.0s)]
*  them do that. My concern is for similar reasons that the US wouldn't push for it because we're [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2488.08s)]
*  complicit in this. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, you're pointing the finger yourself because there's this [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2493.2000000000003s)]
*  question of, has the US violated laws in providing arms to Israel despite credible concerns of both [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2497.36s)]
*  war crimes and restrictions on aid getting into humanitarian populations? Yeah. I mean, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2504.72s)]
*  that reality is staring you right in the face. It's hard to see that that wasn't the case. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2512.56s)]
*  Yeah. Diplomatically, Israel is getting increasingly isolated. The Israeli government [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2518.3999999999996s)]
*  is about to close its embassy in Ireland. Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sarr, said that was because [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2522.16s)]
*  of, quote, the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government. His statement cited Ireland's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2526.8799999999997s)]
*  decision to support the case of the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2532.72s)]
*  Gaza. Here is the Taoiseach, Simon Harris, reacting to the closure. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2537.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, no one should be surprised by this. There's a lot of historic solidarity in Ireland [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2562.72s)]
*  for the Palestinian people because the Irish were occupied for so long by the British government. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2581.04s)]
*  That response though from the Irish intensified the diplomatic row and the Israeli foreign minister [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2586.9599999999996s)]
*  issued a statement calling him anti-Semitic for those comments. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2595.68s)]
*  Why? People need to call this out as complete and utter bullshit. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2599.52s)]
*  And cynical. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2605.7599999999998s)]
*  First of all, the Irish solidarity with Palestinians is long established. And by the way, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2608.0s)]
*  it's not reserved to any one political party in Ireland. What the Taoiseach is saying is a pretty [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2611.68s)]
*  widely held view in Ireland because they were colonized for hundreds of years and have a natural [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2616.08s)]
*  sympathy and solidarity with people who they see as being occupied, as is the case in Gaza and the [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2620.08s)]
*  West Bank. And if you hear his language, it's about actions. It's not about religion or identity. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2626.08s)]
*  This kind of performative outrage over and over and over again. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  Really think that guy sounds like a raving anti-Semite? No, he's talking about their [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2642.48s)]
*  genuine concern about what's happened to children in Gaza. And if your reaction to that is to close [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2647.52s)]
*  your embassy. I mean, part of what is so maddening about this is what you hear, we used to hear a lot [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  out of Israel is the desire to be a normal country, to be kind of normalized. That's not the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2659.36s)]
*  behavior of a normal country. That I'm just going to shutter my embassy because I don't like [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2664.8s)]
*  what the prime minister of this country said or did. And point me to the thing that is actually [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2670.2400000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitic. They don't like that they recognize the Palestinian state. They don't like that they [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2676.1600000000003s)]
*  criticize them over Gaza. But again, as the Taoiseach said, this is a kind of a diplomacy [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2679.92s)]
*  of distraction and obfuscation and name calling. And it does nothing to kind of advance anything [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2686.8s)]
*  other than it plays to a certain politics in Israel and maybe in the United States. I mean, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2693.04s)]
*  I thought we used to like the Irish. There's a lot of Irish people in this country. Yeah, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2699.44s)]
*  I think we love them. Yeah, I like that. I hear that accent and I get happy. Like it makes me [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2703.6000000000004s)]
*  think of my Irish friends. Yeah, there's a lot of politicians here, elected officials even, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2708.5600000000004s)]
*  who used to support the IRA. Yeah, well, they like to wear green ties on St. Patrick's Day, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2712.88s)]
*  but they probably won't say anything about this. Or the Palestinian people. Yeah. Very cool. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2716.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, Ben, let's turn back to South Korea. The last few weeks, we've been covering the political [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2722.48s)]
*  crisis there. After President Yoon Suk-yul declared martial law and seemingly tried to stage a coup, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2726.48s)]
*  albeit a self-coup because he was in charge at the time. This past Saturday, President [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  Yoon was officially impeached by the National Assembly. An earlier vote had been boycotted by [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2735.6800000000003s)]
*  Yoon's party, the PPP. But this time, the PPP allowed their members to vote and 12 PPP lawmakers [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2740.96s)]
*  voted to impeach President Yoon via secret ballot, which got you over the two-thirds threshold that [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2747.2s)]
*  you needed to actually impeach. Now Korea's constitutional court has 180 days to decide [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2752.4s)]
*  whether Yoon is guilty and to formally remove him. I was talking to someone today who said [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2757.28s)]
*  that could take like a month or it could take several months. We're not really sure yet, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2762.16s)]
*  however long it takes the court to ascertain guilt or innocence. The vote will require [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2766.72s)]
*  six of the court's nine members to support impeachment. But as we discussed last week, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2772.3199999999997s)]
*  there are currently three vacancies on the court. So there's only six judges total and three of them [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2777.04s)]
*  were put in place or have ties to President Yoon. So it's not clear how that vote will go. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2781.4399999999996s)]
*  If Yoon is removed, there will be a snap election in 60 days and it's likely that the [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2786.24s)]
*  Liberal Party will take power. If not, Yoon is restored as president and God knows what happens [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2790.24s)]
*  next. Actually, we know what happens next. Yeah, Yoon gets reelected. It's Donald Trump, baby. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2795.76s)]
*  Yoon is declared that he's going to fight to the end, but some of his allies have already [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2801.5200000000004s)]
*  gone down. The former defense minister and two former police chiefs have been arrested [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2805.1200000000003s)]
*  for their roles in the insurrection. The defense minister attempted suicide in custody. This is [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2809.0400000000004s)]
*  very ugly stuff. PPP's leader Han Dong-hoon resigned amidst a backlash for supporting the [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2813.76s)]
*  impeachment. Good for him for doing the right thing. The prime minister and acting president [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2819.76s)]
*  is a man named Han Deok-su, who was Korea's ambassador to the US from 2009 to 2012. So [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2824.72s)]
*  we probably ran across him. Yeah, I know. I met that guy. He's a pretty well-known [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2830.08s)]
*  quantity in Washington. Yeah, technocrat, kind of has things handled. But again, I was talking to [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2832.56s)]
*  a Korean expert today, Ben, who said he kind of heard two theories about what could happen next. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2837.9199999999996s)]
*  The first is the coup attempt was so egregious that this court, even if it's just six of them, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2842.56s)]
*  even if they have ties to Yoon, they got to toss them out. The second theory though is Yoon's a [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2847.68s)]
*  former prosecutor. He knows how to play hardball. He knows how the process works. He's rejected a [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2853.04s)]
*  bunch of off-ramps that could have made this easier on himself. He keeps saying he wants to [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  fight it out. That might suggest he knows something, which is that he has the backing of at least one [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2863.92s)]
*  of these six judges, which means he'll be president again. Either way, US-Korea relations seem likely [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2869.2s)]
*  to get a lot more complicated for the Trump administration. Yeah. Let's not send Merrick [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2878.0s)]
*  Garland over there to give them advice on how to deal with these circumstances. No. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2884.16s)]
*  The other dynamic here though is if he does try to pull some judicial maneuver, there's someone [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2889.12s)]
*  who will do his bidding. What you've seen is that there'll be huge street protests and huge unrest. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2895.92s)]
*  I mean, any effort to kind of reinstall Yoon just feels like that place goes berserk. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2902.16s)]
*  I think his approval is at 11%. Yeah. So it just feels like you would hope that they just [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2907.52s)]
*  kind of finish the work here of getting past this Yoon era and this huge excessive power grab. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2913.68s)]
*  To your last point though, again, if you look around the world, Korea is clearly going to be [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2920.96s)]
*  divided and internally focused for a period of time here. Japan has had some bumpy politics [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2928.08s)]
*  of late. Germany, their government just collapsed. Macron is a lame duck with what? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2934.64s)]
*  It's fourth prime minister. Trudeau will talk about ... The G7 is not doing that well. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2941.52s)]
*  Where like the tectonic shifts part of the podcast. There's a lot of major powers [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2949.2799999999997s)]
*  with big changes coming. Yeah. And maybe Trump doesn't give a shit about those countries, but [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2954.08s)]
*  I got to tell you, there's a lot of consistency at the top in Russia and China and some of those [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2959.2s)]
*  types of countries. And this is going to be a very uncertain year ahead of us because you've got all [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2965.6s)]
*  this turnover and all these democracies, all these people inwardly focused and a lot of instability. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know, we'll see how that goes. That G7 family photo is going to look a little different [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2978.0s)]
*  than it did a year ago. Very different. Yeah. Well, let's turn to Germany where you have [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2982.96s)]
*  basically the opposite situation in South Korea because you have German Chancellor Olaf Scholz [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2986.88s)]
*  calling for a vote of no confidence on himself in the Bundestag of Monday, knowing that he would [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2991.44s)]
*  lose it. 394 members voted no, 207 voted yes, 116 abstained. He needed 367 yes votes for the vote of [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=2996.6400000000003s)]
*  confidence to be successful, so he got destroyed. But Scholz called for this vote on purpose [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3006.1600000000003s)]
*  because he was out of options. He has been floundering since his coalition fell apart [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3011.12s)]
*  in November after he fired his finance minister who was part of the FDP party that led that whole [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3015.92s)]
*  party to withdraw from the coalition and left Scholz in charge of a minority lame duck government. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3022.32s)]
*  Germany's elections were not supposed to happen again until September, but per the BBC, Scholz [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3027.12s)]
*  feels that his party would fare better in an earlier snap election. So he called for the only [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3032.08s)]
*  way to call to trigger a snap election was to lose a vote of confidence. So he called the vote, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3036.96s)]
*  face planted, and now there's an election in late February. This election will be huge for Germany, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3042.0s)]
*  huge for Europe. The big fear is that the far-right AFD party could make substantial gains. They're [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3048.08s)]
*  currently polling at around 18%, but my scared little American brain is worried about far-right [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3054.16s)]
*  parties outperforming their polling here and abroad. The major parties all rule out working [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3059.68s)]
*  with AFD, but who knows? Friedrich Mertz of the center-right CDU party is leading the polls at 32%. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3065.76s)]
*  He describes himself as socially conservative, but economically liberal. He is a longtime rival [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3071.68s)]
*  of Angela Merkel's, but lost to her in a leadership election so badly that he ended up leaving [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3076.32s)]
*  politics for decades. But he's a big supporter of arming Ukraine against a Russian invasion. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3081.52s)]
*  So bad. Again, this didn't happen because of a failed coup attempt like in South Korea, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3088.0s)]
*  but it's another, it's a huge variable for Ukraine. It's a huge variable for Europe. Germany's got all [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3091.6s)]
*  these economic challenges, and we got a US leadership change happening right before this one. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3096.48s)]
*  Yeah. And Mertz seems like the most likely outcome, but again, what does the coalition look like? How [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  well does the AFD do? I mean, part of Schulz's problem is having a social democratic party in [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3109.12s)]
*  a coalition with a hawkish green party and a libertarian party was kind of a strange mix, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3113.44s)]
*  and hard to get things done. And the reality too is that anytime you have a turnover in one [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3119.2s)]
*  of these big European countries, like say France or Germany, it takes a while to set up your [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3124.8s)]
*  coalition to figure out the fucking EU. Months. How are you going to work with the French and how [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3129.76s)]
*  are you going to work with these other European powers and how are you going to work with the EU [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3135.28s)]
*  and how are you going to deal with Ukraine? It's just disruptive to have all these transitions. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3138.1600000000003s)]
*  Macron's got an election coming down the pikes. So there's just a big void of leadership in Europe [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3143.1200000000003s)]
*  right now. Weirdly, Maloney in Italy, because she's maybe in the far right zeitgeist these days, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3149.04s)]
*  is the most stable government. Tusk and Poland to some extent, but Maloney now is riding high. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3156.16s)]
*  She's meeting with Elon. She's got her buddy Trump coming in. So the Italians, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3162.16s)]
*  unusually for them, are the stable political force in Europe. But boy, there's a lot of [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3168.4s)]
*  vacuums out there. Yeah. The Brits are not EU anymore, but yeah, the Labour Party went in, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3173.2s)]
*  they were riding high and they just tripped right out the gate. Now they're already resetting [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3177.92s)]
*  things. You're right, there's not a lot of stability. They're resetting things and they're also, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3182.64s)]
*  again, likely to be the only center-left leader left in the G7 by the time all the dust settles. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3186.48s)]
*  So it's a different world for them in the next few years. They may be imagined if it was a [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3192.56s)]
*  Democrat in the US and a Social Democrat in Germany and Trudeau or a Liberal in Canada. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3198.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's also an interesting lesson in leadership style. I mean, Merkel was [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3203.92s)]
*  buttoned up, serious, but I don't know, she just had some sort of charisma. She had a lot of [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3209.2000000000003s)]
*  leadership abilities. I mean, Schulz was, they called him the Schulzomat because he was boring [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3214.32s)]
*  and mechanical. There's this great quote I saw, Ben. On the evening of his election as mayor of [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3220.16s)]
*  Hamburg in 2011, he was being interviewed by a TV interviewer, a reporter, who said to him, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3227.44s)]
*  today is essentially Christmas and a birthday and one for you and yet you seem about as euphoric [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3233.2s)]
*  as an English butler at tea time. Yeah, not a lot of charisma there. It's like, come on, man. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3236.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And there was an opportunity after like 15 years of Angela Merkel, the pendulum was going [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3242.8799999999997s)]
*  to swing to the Social Democrats, but they didn't exactly seize that pendulum. No, pendulum is [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3247.6s)]
*  swinging back. Kind of like, kind of like here. Speaking of which also, things are looking a [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3253.4399999999996s)]
*  little dicey for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau up in Canada. On Monday, Christoph Freeland, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3259.92s)]
*  his finance minister and deputy prime minister left his cabinet writing a rather pointed [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3265.2000000000003s)]
*  resignation letter. She said that while they should be preparing for Trump's threat of 25% [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3269.76s)]
*  tariffs, Trudeau was instead preoccupied with quote, costly political gimmicks like the sales [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3274.56s)]
*  tax holiday. Long considered one of Trudeau's loyal ministers, her timing was very tough. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3279.04s)]
*  She left the day she was supposed to deliver the government's fall economic statement, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3285.36s)]
*  meaning he was left scrambling. Trump helpfully weighed in on truth social, weighed in on her [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3289.04s)]
*  resignation writing quote, the great state of Canada is stunned as the finance minister resigns [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3293.92s)]
*  or is fired from her position by governor Justin Trudeau. Her behavior was totally toxic and not [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3299.36s)]
*  at all conducive to making deals, which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3304.32s)]
*  not be missed. One, two, three exclamation points. She's really riding with this governor Trudeau [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3309.52s)]
*  thing. The knife was twisted further by Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the lefty new Democratic [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3315.12s)]
*  party, the kind of Bernie Sanders party up there, who up until September had an agreement with [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  Trudeau's liberals to help keep them in power. Singh called for Trudeau to resign yesterday. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3325.52s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. Right now, Canadians are struggling with the cost of living. I hear [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3330.08s)]
*  it everywhere I go. People cannot find a home that they can afford. They can't buy their groceries. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3335.2s)]
*  And on top of that, we have Trump threatening tariffs of 25%, which put hundreds and thousands [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3340.24s)]
*  of Canadian jobs at risk. And instead of focusing on these issues, Justin Trudeau and the liberals [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3347.2s)]
*  are focused on themselves. They're fighting themselves instead of fighting for Canadians. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3353.4399999999996s)]
*  For that reason, today I'm calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. He has to go. Will you declare no [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3357.6s)]
*  confidence in the liberal government as soon as possible? All tools, all options are on the table. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3363.8399999999997s)]
*  People are hurting. People are struggling. And so all options are on the table. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3370.4799999999996s)]
*  All options are on the table. It makes me sound like you're going to nuke him. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3374.72s)]
*  I guess he is politically. So Ben, elections are scheduled for next September. Some people are [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  saying Trudeau should resign early, maybe put the party in a better place in advance of the election. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3383.2s)]
*  I don't know. Do you have thoughts here? I mean, maybe just see if you can improve things in seven [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3387.7599999999998s)]
*  months, nine months? I think it's hard. I mean, the reality is we've talked about how in 2024, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3392.24s)]
*  Tommy, I saw a wild graphic. This is the first time in history that every single incumbent party [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3399.2s)]
*  in a democracy lost vote share. So even the ones that won, like Modi lost vote share. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3407.2s)]
*  Trudeau has been an incumbent for a decade. So when you take the anti-incumbent mood everywhere [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3412.64s)]
*  and you stretch that out over the course of a decade, you add in a cost of living crisis. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3419.76s)]
*  Yeah. Big time. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3424.16s)]
*  Trudeau's got huge political headwinds. I call them political hurricanes. Then you have this [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3425.44s)]
*  question about he's dominated the Liberal Party. And we should say, kind of brought them back from [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3431.04s)]
*  the wilderness. But you start to get tensions as we've had in the Democratic Party. Well, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3434.7999999999997s)]
*  who's next? Christy Freeland is someone that people have long thought could be a natural [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3439.8399999999997s)]
*  successor to Trudeau. She could be making her play there. Melanie Jolie, who's the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  foreign minister, another person who's talked about there. I think Trudeau, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3448.6400000000003s)]
*  Candice hosting the G7 again this year. I think he wanted to do that again. I'm not sure that's [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3452.6400000000003s)]
*  as fun a party as it may seem like it would have been once. So look, there's not really a good [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3458.88s)]
*  path for Trudeau here. It does just seem like he's got a choice between, do I step aside now and let [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3465.36s)]
*  a leadership fight take place so that someone else can lead this party into the next election? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3472.48s)]
*  They will probably lose, frankly, even with a different leader. Or do I kind of play out the [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3476.72s)]
*  string here, kind of go through the tape at the end of my term. And if I lose, I lose, and then [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3481.68s)]
*  the party regenerates. And that choice may not, he may not get to make it because there could be [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3487.4399999999996s)]
*  enough liberal defections to challenge his leadership. But it definitely looks like shaky [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3492.7999999999997s)]
*  ground for Trudeau. I don't know what the right answer is, but he's got to figure out a response [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3498.56s)]
*  to this Governor Trudeau bullshit. You can't let this asshole bully you and kind of turn the other [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3503.68s)]
*  cheek and grin and bear it. I'm not saying that you have to be caustic back, but you got to figure [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3510.3999999999996s)]
*  out something. And again, they're not trying to be all like love actually. And this is Hugh Grant [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3514.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of slapping around the Billy Bob Thornton George Bush character, but I don't know. He's [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3520.3199999999997s)]
*  not going to stop doing it. He's trying to run you out of office. This guy is not a good natured [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3525.6s)]
*  ribbit. Yeah. So go out, you're one of the longest, together with your father, you're the longest [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3530.24s)]
*  serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. You're a younger guy. Take some swings back. I mean, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3534.3999999999996s)]
*  he tried flying down there to Mar-a-Lago. I mean, Freeland, what's interesting about what she did is [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3540.24s)]
*  she seems to be sticking out a harder line. Like I'm not going to go kowtow at Mar-a-Lago. And we [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3544.24s)]
*  can debate whether that's the right strategy or not. But the reality is, Trump's got to feel some [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3549.52s)]
*  pushback. And maybe there could be an unplugged Trudeau. If he's on his way out the door, he can [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3554.96s)]
*  take some swings back. But as we've talked about, and we'll keep saying, Tommy, the charm offensive [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3562.64s)]
*  thing does not work with Trump if he doesn't like you or if he doesn't like your brand of politics. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3568.88s)]
*  And yeah, I think for the sake of Canadians, it'd probably be a good thing to do a little [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3574.16s)]
*  more pushback to the government. Just think of that. People may chuckle about it, but it's like [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3580.24s)]
*  a country. It's like one of our closest allies and trading partners in the world. They're in NATO. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3586.8799999999997s)]
*  They've fought with us in places like Afghanistan. I don't know. I don't think that's that funny. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3592.08s)]
*  No, it's insulting. And I kind of wondered a lot what Canadians think of those kind of comments [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3596.64s)]
*  on a pod a week or two ago. And I got a bunch of texts from friends or notes in the Discord being [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3603.3599999999997s)]
*  we kind of think of these as buffoons. We don't really notice it. But there's other people who [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3610.16s)]
*  are like, we notice it. It's insulting. And it sucks. Well, the sad thing is they probably [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3613.68s)]
*  don't notice it because they think that that's how Americans think in general. Yeah, they were just [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3618.3199999999997s)]
*  assholes. So that may be what he's counting on. But yeah, it's tough to watch. But again, you have [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3622.08s)]
*  to see it from the prism of this anti-incumbency. And the right-wing guy in Canada. What's his name? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3628.08s)]
*  Pierre? Paul Lever? Yeah. If he gets in, good luck. Because guess what? Trump's not going to [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3633.8399999999997s)]
*  do you any favors either at those tariffs. No, no. Finally, Ben, we're going to check in on [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3638.72s)]
*  everyone's favorite member of the royal family, Prince Andrew. Perhaps missing his old friend, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3644.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew, King Charles' 64 year old brother, if you're not familiar with him, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3648.72s)]
*  decided to make some new friends. Andrew started hanging out with a guy named Yang Tengbo. Yang [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3654.0s)]
*  went to Andrew's birthday party in 2020. And according to the BBC, quote, was told he could [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3659.52s)]
*  act on the royal's behalf when dealing with potential investors in China. This is not a [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3664.4s)]
*  great decision because now Yang has been barred from the UK for allegedly being a Chinese spy. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3669.12s)]
*  According to a High Court judge, Yang and Prince Andrew had, quote, an unusual degree of trust. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3673.84s)]
*  And Yang is also accused of trying to build relationships between prominent British officials [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3679.44s)]
*  and then leverage them for political purposes for the Chinese state, for Chinese intelligence. We're [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  not exactly sure. He didn't have like a clear instruction manual from the spy handlers, but [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3689.52s)]
*  he had lots of connections to various sort of carve outs for the Chinese communist party and [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3692.96s)]
*  just some sketchy ties. Yang denies all these allegations. Either way, it's another embarrassment [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3698.88s)]
*  for Prince Andrew, who had already been stripped of his charity roles and royal duties by his mother, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3704.4s)]
*  Queen Elizabeth. Now to add insult to injury, he's reportedly been uninvited to the family [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3708.8s)]
*  Christmas celebration to avoid being a distraction, Ben. So down another friend. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3714.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, the thing about Prince Andrew is that a lot of this, you know, in this world of espionage [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3719.44s)]
*  and influence peddling, you know, your vulnerability is that you could be blackmailed. I mean, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3724.2400000000002s)]
*  this guy is such a fucking utter train wreck that maybe he's unblockmailable, you know? I mean, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3729.92s)]
*  literally flying around with Jeffrey Epstein on his plane and doing God knows what. It is kind of [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3734.96s)]
*  time to rethink this institution. I mean, like narrowing the set of royals that are, I don't know. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3740.8s)]
*  A lot out of the house. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3747.76s)]
*  What is going on here? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3751.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, sometimes they use them deftly. Like they sent William to Notre Dame to Paris, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3753.44s)]
*  that ceremony, and they had to spend a bunch of time with Trump. And Trump is obviously in love [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3760.96s)]
*  with the royals, loves the trappings, loves to feel respected by the Queen and King and Prince. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3765.36s)]
*  But you're right. I mean, Prince Andrew, I don't know. I'm still worried about the fact that he [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3770.6400000000003s)]
*  got his mom's corgis when she died. Hope those dogs are okay. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3774.32s)]
*  Yeah. Hope someone's feeding those dogs other than Prince Andrew. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3777.52s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3779.36s)]
*  It does raise this other question too, like the extent to which, I mean, we talk about the Chinese [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3780.7200000000003s)]
*  hack here, like these countries are throwing their weight around in our politics and our institutions [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3785.2000000000003s)]
*  and we don't seem to have a theory of how to deal with it because we're so wealth obsessed that, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3789.92s)]
*  you know, Mr. Yang shows up and suddenly you're like, oh, sure, whatever you want. You know, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3795.28s)]
*  this great institution, the British Royal Family is basically for sale, you know? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3799.92s)]
*  And he was part of some club where he came in contact with all these other senior officials. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3803.52s)]
*  I think Theresa May was on the list, like high powered members of the British elite class were [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3807.6000000000004s)]
*  just kind of bumping into this guy everywhere. And it seems like from some of the reporting [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3814.0800000000004s)]
*  that British intelligence thinks this is kind of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Chinese [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3819.76s)]
*  efforts to establish these kinds of ties or conduct espionage in the UK. We know that London [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3825.0400000000004s)]
*  is just awash with Russian money. Russian money, golf money, Chinese money, you know, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3830.96s)]
*  it is just kind of washing around. Thanks to very pliant laws. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3837.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I will say the labor people have tried to take some steps to come back, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3843.44s)]
*  kleptocracy. David Lammy's had a couple of announcements. It's just going to take a lot [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3847.84s)]
*  of work. Yeah, long time. And it's part of what's so complicated is part of London's comparative [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3851.04s)]
*  advantage is that is this kind of financial capital and this haven essentially for rich [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3856.08s)]
*  people from around the world. But that cuts both ways. Yeah. Okay, we're going to take a quick [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3862.56s)]
*  break. When you come back, you're going to hear my interview with Laila Milana Allen. She is a [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3866.96s)]
*  special correspondent for PBS NewsHour. We talked from wherever she was staying in Aleppo, Syria. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3871.04s)]
*  She'd been all over the country talking with people, going to some of the horrific prison sites [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3877.6s)]
*  and, you know, the intel gathering torture chambers. It's an amazing conversation. So [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3883.4399999999996s)]
*  please stick around for that. I'm excited to welcome back to the show Laila Milana Allen. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3889.2799999999997s)]
*  She's a special correspondent for PBS NewsHour. The last time we spoke, she was in Beirut. And [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3893.2s)]
*  now she is in Aleppo, Syria. Great to talk with you again. Great to be back with you. First [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3899.52s)]
*  question, just what is it like? I know you've been all across Syria. What are you seeing and [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3904.56s)]
*  hearing from people? Well, I think something that's made this a particularly powerful reporting [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3909.52s)]
*  experience for me is that I managed to get in undercover a year ago. So unlike most of the [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3914.72s)]
*  reporters here at the moment, who haven't been able to get in for years, I did. And the difference [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3919.36s)]
*  is just utterly jarring. You know, having previously had to kind of whisper everything and be constantly [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3924.32s)]
*  terrified of protecting everybody who dared to speak to you. This is people running up to you on [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3930.88s)]
*  the street, asking you where you're from, desperate to speak to you, wanting to take photographs with [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3937.2s)]
*  you. You know, the level of kind of shock and joy at this very, very sudden freedom that no one [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3942.0s)]
*  expected is really overwhelming. Because of course, people who lived in the rebel-held Northwest [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3948.72s)]
*  knew this offensive was coming, but nobody in regime-held Syria did. So it really came out of [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3953.04s)]
*  nowhere. And it's almost like the curtains have been opened and the light has come in and people [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3957.68s)]
*  are still adapting to how to see in that light. It's incredible. I mean, I know that I've seen some [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3963.2s)]
*  of the clips you've posted of these groups of young people just like filled with joy and excitement. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3968.72s)]
*  But obviously that sentiment can curdle pretty quickly if people don't have the basics, you know, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3974.0s)]
*  food, water, electricity, other services. How is HDS moving to take care of those basics for people [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3978.3999999999996s)]
*  in these early days? Well, that's exactly it. Now, of course, there have been issues with all those [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3985.04s)]
*  services here for a very long time. But that does mean that people struggle. You know, electricity [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3988.8s)]
*  is terrible. There's often no petrol available. I mean, people are selling water down petrol [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3994.0s)]
*  on the side of the street. A lot of it's being smuggled in from Lebanon now. There's a lot of [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=3998.8s)]
*  problems with basic road infrastructure. You know, one of the issues is that the roads haven't been [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4003.6000000000004s)]
*  that much used, particularly between areas that were held by different groups for a long time, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4008.32s)]
*  except by military vehicles. So they're shredded to pieces. You know, road signs are terrible. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  So all of these things now that people are free to move around are things that they want to start [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4017.76s)]
*  to work. And of course, connectivity is a huge issue because when you are under such oppression [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4021.92s)]
*  and you couldn't speak to your family members and you couldn't contact people in the outside world [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4026.4s)]
*  on the internet, that was almost less of an issue. Now that people suddenly can, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4029.92s)]
*  they want to be able to use that. So there is a grace period, of course. You know, people are [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4033.76s)]
*  delighted that the rebels have come down and liberated them, as they keep saying. But they [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4038.48s)]
*  are going to need to fix that soon. At the moment, there's not a huge amount of work happening on [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4043.44s)]
*  basic services. Really what they're trying to figure out is road safety, for instance. So [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4047.76s)]
*  checkpoints have started to come up, checking both whether stolen vehicles are being moved around, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4052.4s)]
*  whether there are people who are complicit in the horrific crimes that we're discovering, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4056.88s)]
*  conducted by the Assad regime, trying to escape. So there's a lot of checkpoints coming up. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4061.44s)]
*  There's also now reinforcement of the borders. The borders have been sitting wide open. When I [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4065.36s)]
*  came in from Lebanon a week ago, we sailed through. There was nobody there except a smiling young [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4069.6s)]
*  Free Syrian Army soldier with a gun. Now they are sending people down there. The reality is, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4074.4s)]
*  at the moment, they don't have enough fighters and manpower, because all they've had in terms [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4079.68s)]
*  of administrative people is those people who are running the Salvation Government up in Idlib. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4085.44s)]
*  Suddenly, they need politicians for the entire country. So they're going to have to make decisions [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4089.7599999999998s)]
*  pretty soon about whether they're going to forgive and move on with the people who ran [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4093.7599999999998s)]
*  municipalities with local politicians to get their expertise on board, or whether they're [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4098.56s)]
*  going to try and really staff all the ministries and all the municipality buildings with HTS [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4102.96s)]
*  fighters and other rebels. That's not clear yet, but they are going to have to make some deals and [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4108.0s)]
*  bring some other people on board if there's any way they're going to run this country effectively. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4112.240000000001s)]
*  At the moment, there has been a temporary government put in place, run by Mahmoud Abdel-Dashir. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4116.56s)]
*  He's been appointed by Ahmed Sharah. That's the name of Abu Muhammad al-Julani, who took away [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4121.84s)]
*  his Jihadi name. He lost that Jihadi name and went back to bin Ahmed Sharah to prove [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4128.8s)]
*  this liberalization agenda that he's got. So he's assigned Muhammad al-Dashir as Prime Minister. He [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4133.12s)]
*  was the man who was running the show up in Idlib. They've got till March 1st, essentially, to try [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4138.64s)]
*  and get basic services back on the road. Then they're going to need to think about whether [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4143.28s)]
*  they're going to have elections and who's going to be involved in those. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4146.24s)]
*  Just an enormous task. You mentioned the horrific things we're seeing coming out of Assad's prisons [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4148.96s)]
*  and torture chambers. I know you visited one. I know that human rights groups are starting to [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4155.2s)]
*  exhume mass graves and take other steps to find missing people, even if they're dead or otherwise [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4160.16s)]
*  account for Assad's atrocities. Can you just talk a little bit about what you saw and whether [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4166.320000000001s)]
*  there are conversations happening about some sort of process, a truth and reconciliation process, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4171.76s)]
*  maybe, that might lead to accountability? The first prison I went to here was Sadnaya prison. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4177.04s)]
*  This is the most infamous of the network of prisons that the Assads ran in this country. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4183.92s)]
*  For years now, through so many years reporting on Syria, it has been a theme of almost every [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4192.24s)]
*  conversation. Desperate family members wondering whether their family members might be there, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4198.08s)]
*  sometimes having been told they were and being manipulated by the authorities [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4203.28s)]
*  into trying to get information from other people going there and potentially being tortured [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4207.679999999999s)]
*  themselves while trying to free their family members. Many people who didn't know where their [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4212.48s)]
*  family members had been detained to assumed it was Sadnaya partly because it was the biggest. It's [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4216.719999999999s)]
*  this huge complex of multiple floors and also because, as I say, it's the most infamous. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4221.84s)]
*  Now, a lot of the torture was also conducted in the intelligence branch offices across the country, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4227.28s)]
*  but eventually people would be moved to these prisons. Going inside, we have heard so many [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4232.8s)]
*  stories, but you really can't understand the full reality of it until you enter this space, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4237.4400000000005s)]
*  floors high, enormous rooms that evidently had 30, 40 people at least packed inside. There are [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4243.76s)]
*  blankets everywhere, the debris of human beings packed in closely together, video cameras monitoring [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4249.84s)]
*  their every move. And then you go downstairs underground and it's truly terrifying seeing [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4255.44s)]
*  these tiny little cells with marks etched on the wall as human beings tried to keep track of the [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4263.28s)]
*  days, tried to essentially interact with themselves in some ways. There are even things like knots [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4269.12s)]
*  from crosses, you know, as people just tried to keep themselves going, tiny little cells that [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4273.679999999999s)]
*  sting, obviously, because people weren't allowed out. And then you see the torture that was being [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4278.4s)]
*  implemented from, there was a hole in the floor that prisoners told us that the guards used to [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4283.92s)]
*  fill with human feces and submerge them in it to humiliate them and even simulate drowning. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4290.0s)]
*  A wall full of nooses where public hangings would take place. Various machinery that seems to have [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4295.28s)]
*  been used, I'm talking about industrial machinery, to talk to human beings and potentially even to [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4301.84s)]
*  dispose of their bodies. And then you start to track where those bodies have gone. And we went [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4307.52s)]
*  to several local hospitals trying to track down bodies that had been discovered in a military [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4312.48s)]
*  hospital and quickly moved. These bodies were stacked on top of each other in various states [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4317.599999999999s)]
*  of decay, some with limbs missing, all bearing the signs of torture. We managed to track them [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4321.679999999999s)]
*  down at a hospital where family members were coming to try and identify them. And it's a real [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4326.5599999999995s)]
*  race against time because as bodies decay, their features change. And so few of these people will [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4330.48s)]
*  have DNA on record. They are trying to do DNA tests that really they're desperately setting [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4335.839999999999s)]
*  these photographs around, trying to trigger any kind of recognition because so many tens of [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4340.56s)]
*  thousands of people, still family members missing. Unfortunately, as you say, many of those people, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4346.56s)]
*  it does now seem clear, will be in mass graves. There are multiple sites that people have [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4351.76s)]
*  suspected for years and now they're going to start looking at them. I was at one of the first [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4356.160000000001s)]
*  exhumations today, the small mass grave just outside Damascus. Body parts found in flower [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4360.400000000001s)]
*  bags, old bags of flour that they had put these body parts in. They didn't even have names on them. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4366.96s)]
*  They were labeled with prisoner numbers. And so having to remove these body parts and then [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4372.08s)]
*  start to think about how you can identify these people while also wanting to give them a respectful [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4377.36s)]
*  burial is a huge challenge. The people currently doing that are the Civil Defense. Those are the [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4382.0s)]
*  very famous white helmets who for many years have conducted rescue operations in northwest Syria, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4387.04s)]
*  rebel held Syria after Russian airstrikes and Assad regime bombardment. They've now come down [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4391.76s)]
*  and across the country are trying to help with this. And one of the massive issues is that [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4397.360000000001s)]
*  families are starting to go to these grave sites where they think their family members might be [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4400.88s)]
*  buried and dig through them. Of course, that both disturbs the grave and contaminates evidence, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4405.280000000001s)]
*  the only evidence that could be used to try and prosecute the people who are responsible for these [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4410.56s)]
*  crimes. So if there's any possibility of being able to get this evidence on file, those graves [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4416.08s)]
*  have to be exhumed properly, cleanly with great attention to detail. And the thousands of documents [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4422.48s)]
*  that we're finding in these prisons and in these interrogation cells in the intelligence branches [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4430.08s)]
*  have to be properly documented and preserved. At the moment they're being walked across, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4435.2s)]
*  they're being thrown in the air. There's a real danger that all that evidence just disappears [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4438.8s)]
*  because there isn't a process in place. Yeah, I've seen some of those images and those concerns as [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4442.72s)]
*  well on social media. I mean, presumably there are lots of people who worked at these facilities [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4446.8s)]
*  still in the country. I mean, they would probably tell you that they were captives of a system that [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4453.52s)]
*  forced them into doing these evil things. But I imagine those excuses are not going to go over [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4459.4400000000005s)]
*  very well with the relatives of the people who are disappeared or murdered. What is happening [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4465.68s)]
*  with the people that used to work at Sidneya Prison, for example? It's a huge challenge, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4470.56s)]
*  as it always is in these situations, particularly where we are now, which is that there does seem [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4475.84s)]
*  to be, without being too naive about it, a golden opportunity right now where HTS is feeling quite [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4480.96s)]
*  benign, certainly behaving very benignly to the majority of people. People are overwhelmingly keen [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4487.52s)]
*  to reunite and have a Syria for all Syrians. And that does mean some forgiveness. I was speaking [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4493.76s)]
*  to one of the most famous Sidneya detainees who managed to get out the other day. And he said, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4499.92s)]
*  look, these people did the most horrifying things imaginable, but there are so many of them who were [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4505.6s)]
*  involved with this regime. The reality is we're going to have to forgive some people. Otherwise, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4511.84s)]
*  we'll have hate in our hearts forever and we can't move forward. You can't prosecute and imprison, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4516.24s)]
*  however, many thousands of people in the country. So you've got to make a decision about [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4522.16s)]
*  what level of involvement and decision making makes you complicit. Now, of course, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4525.76s)]
*  the people in the highest echelons, many of them have managed to escape. Multiple [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4531.68s)]
*  Assad aides have been seen fleeing to different airports. We know the Assad family themselves [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4537.52s)]
*  are in Moscow now. They've been given political asylum. The other day, the governor of Sidneya [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4541.76s)]
*  Prison was found and he was dragged through the streets and beaten to a pulp. There were a lot of [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4546.96s)]
*  concerns from Syrians on social media saying, look, no matter what this man did, we need to [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4551.6s)]
*  set an example and we need to take him to a dock and convict him in a court, not have mob justice. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4555.76s)]
*  But of course, if there isn't a methodology in place, if there isn't a system for trying these [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4561.76s)]
*  people, then this is exactly what's going to happen. They're going to be hunted down. And of [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4567.76s)]
*  course, that in itself means that there'll be a whole new round of crimes that people are concerned [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4571.280000000001s)]
*  about. So one of so many challenges that these very new authorities have is to try and figure [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4576.16s)]
*  out quickly how to do that and make people feel that there will be some form of justice and they [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4582.8s)]
*  don't need to implement it themselves. Yeah, man, what an enormous task. I mean, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4586.72s)]
*  just stepping back on sort of like a DC perspective, there's this debate in Washington, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4591.12s)]
*  a debate in European capitals about whether to recognize the new government, whether to lift [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4595.5199999999995s)]
*  sanctions, whether to remove the terrorist designation from HTS. Do you have a sense of what [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4600.24s)]
*  kind of the average Syrians you're talking to want from the West, want from the United States? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4606.719999999999s)]
*  I would say they want a lot and they expect very little. You know, the majority of people I've [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4611.679999999999s)]
*  spoken to say, look, you abandoned us in 2014 after the first chemical attack. I was with [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4616.88s)]
*  families who were victims of chemical attacks the other day and then they were saying, you know, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4623.12s)]
*  you and the West stand on your morals and you say that you have these red lines and that there are [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4627.04s)]
*  certain things that aren't allowed and does it really matter how we're murdered? But okay, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4632.16s)]
*  you say it does matter which way we're murdered. So at least are you going to look after us if we're [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4636.08s)]
*  murdered the way that you don't like? Oh no, actually you won't look after us then either. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4640.5599999999995s)]
*  So they really expect very little at all as far as they're concerned, you know, unless there's [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4644.24s)]
*  money to be made for the West here, not much is going to happen. But they are asking for at least [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4648.639999999999s)]
*  a little help. You know, somebody says to me the other day, we can never forgive you for abandoning [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4655.92s)]
*  us and watching us be killed in this way for over a decade. But what we can ask is that right now, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4661.04s)]
*  you can do just a little bit to make up for it. You can lift sanctions and allow this country that [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4666.64s)]
*  is collapsing. And these sanctions have only ever affected everyday people. They've never affected [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4671.28s)]
*  the government. It's just everyday people who can't rebuild their homes, who can't have businesses, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4674.8s)]
*  who can't have communication with the outside. You can lift those sanctions. You can send us [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4678.56s)]
*  proper aid money. You can send in teams to help us with these huge challenges like the mass graves, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4682.4s)]
*  like our justice system. And you can, in this window, as many experts on Syria as well are [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4686.719999999999s)]
*  deeply frustrated about, they're deeply frustrated about the Biden administration's attitude that [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4691.839999999999s)]
*  we're going to wait and see. And it's too soon, as they said the other day, to recognize this new [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4696.48s)]
*  government. There is this window right now where if Western support comes in, it's possible that an [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4700.799999999999s)]
*  actual liberal government can be installed. And of course, the reality is that when people have [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4706.5599999999995s)]
*  prosperity, there is much less likelihood of fermenting discord and the old divisions [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4711.36s)]
*  breaking apart, of which there are so many in Syria after so many years of different conflicts, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4718.0s)]
*  all of which have mixed up with the civil war. So that's what people feel right now, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4723.2s)]
*  is they desperately just want some support and a chance to make this work. And they feel that the [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4727.2s)]
*  West turning their backs on them is the most likely thing to make that implode. Because of course, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4732.24s)]
*  if they have no money, if HTS is still a terrorist-designated organization, it's going [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4737.12s)]
*  to be incredibly hard for them to function. So that's their main concern. There are some [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4741.12s)]
*  countries who are starting to make noises. Already France has said that they are sending a delegation [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4745.599999999999s)]
*  now to interact with the leader of HTS and HTS as a new authority, the Salvation Government, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4749.84s)]
*  to see what they can set up, potentially even open diplomatic services here again. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4757.12s)]
*  That's a real start in terms of at least opening a conversation and treating the people who are now [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4761.6s)]
*  planning to run the country as though they're friends. Because otherwise, the likelihood is [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4769.040000000001s)]
*  that they'll look for other friends and they will probably be friends that the West is not friends [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4773.120000000001s)]
*  with. Right. And look, I say this with humility, having worked in the Obama administration, but I [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4776.96s)]
*  think it's actually kind of worse than not just recognizing the government or removing sanctions [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4781.200000000001s)]
*  or removing the terrorist designation. The US is, as we speak, hitting ISIS targets in Syria. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4786.24s)]
*  The Israelis have blown up most of the Syrian military's big weapons systems. They're taking [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4793.44s)]
*  more and more territory in the Golan Heights with seemingly, I don't know if it's support from the [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4798.24s)]
*  US, but we're not condemning it or stopping them. Are people in Syria hearing about those events? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4803.44s)]
*  Does it anger them? Well, exactly that. The reality is that the US is supporting it by [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4811.5199999999995s)]
*  not engaging their Israeli allies and saying, don't do this right now. They're not just taking out [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4818.56s)]
*  Syrian regime armaments, which of course, remember means that this is the army of the country. This [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4824.16s)]
*  is all the weaponry they have. So they are removing whatever future Syrian state there is this [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4828.88s)]
*  capability of defending itself. They've also, the Israeli Air Force has been systematically [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4834.56s)]
*  destroying the ports on the coast in the last few days. Now that's where the Russians have been [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4841.200000000001s)]
*  based, but those are the only ports that Syria has. So again, not only for defense, but for trade as [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  well and whole new round of destruction, as well as the majority of the suburbs across the country [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4852.0s)]
*  that have been destroyed that they now have to pay to rebuild as well. So Israel using this window [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4858.56s)]
*  of opportunity essentially to sneak in and do whatever they like to bring Syria to its knees [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4863.52s)]
*  militarily is only going to create many, many more issues for this country moving forward. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4870.0s)]
*  And as you say, similarly, the US, the fact that the US with the coalition in northeast Syria, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4875.120000000001s)]
*  of course, all they're allowed to do under that mandate they have is anything to do with ISIS. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4880.72s)]
*  And there are concerns in that desert in Deir Ezzor where I have been myself embedded with [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4885.52s)]
*  troops hunting down ISIS captains who are still in hiding there and trying to bring back ISIS [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4891.84s)]
*  dominance to that area. They're carrying out those strikes essentially to try and waylay any [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4896.400000000001s)]
*  opportunity that ISIS might have to take advantage of this chaos in the area to come back. But the [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4902.56s)]
*  reality is that's yet more destruction and yet more rebuilding that's needed for people here. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4908.88s)]
*  So I think what people here are seeing, and of course they know what's happening. They talk [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4916.0s)]
*  about it every day. Syrians are deeply engaged not only in what's happening on the ground, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4919.68s)]
*  but what Western countries, international people are doing within their country. They're all [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4923.4400000000005s)]
*  talking about it and they can hear the airstrikes. Today, Israel was destroying an area of Damascus [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4927.92s)]
*  where a lot of Iranians live. And actually the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4934.400000000001s)]
*  who was taken 12 years ago, made a statement saying, please stop bombing this area. We know the IRGC [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4939.12s)]
*  was holding him. And if you are bombing this area, this is the most likely place in Damascus [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4944.96s)]
*  that he's being held and you could kill him in doing so. So the fact that essentially [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4949.36s)]
*  Israel is using this opportunity to conduct whatever they like, whatever their long-term [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4954.639999999999s)]
*  plans are, whatever will help them in the future without any thought to what's best for a liberal [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4959.36s)]
*  future for Syria right now is very concerning because it shows people here that there's no [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4966.24s)]
*  chance of them being ally and that their allies in the United States aren't really interested in [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4970.08s)]
*  the future of Syrians either. Yeah. I mean, you mentioned Austin Tice in the search for him. For [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4974.799999999999s)]
*  those who don't know, Austin Tice is a journalist who went missing in 2012. He's believed to have [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4978.56s)]
*  been held by the Assad regime or its allies. It would be a miracle if he were to be found alive [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4982.320000000001s)]
*  over a decade later. Is there like a group on the ground searching for him? And you mentioned he [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4990.0s)]
*  asked to pause those airstrikes by his parents. I was just wondering what that search looks like [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4995.200000000001s)]
*  on the ground. Well, it's actually mostly journalists looking for him. We got a tip the [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=4998.88s)]
*  other day and we went to search this for a military base and there was no one there, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5004.08s)]
*  but it really is journalists who are looking. One of the huge problems with looking for [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5008.72s)]
*  Austin over the years has been that essentially the United States government, successive United [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5013.04s)]
*  States governments have completely refused to engage with the Iranian authorities on this. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5016.48s)]
*  Now, we know that Austin was essentially Iran's prize. So even when there were negotiations [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5022.24s)]
*  through Hezbollah officials who were the ones who were holding him for quite a long time through [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5028.5599999999995s)]
*  the Syrian government, offers outside of the US framework because they refused to pay for hostages, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5032.88s)]
*  but there were other possible plans to pay for him to try and make a trade every single time. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5037.6s)]
*  It would be Iran's IRGC who would put their foot down and say no. So it's very clear that he is [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5043.2s)]
*  being held possibly in Iran, but most probably by an Iran-linked group inside the country. And [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5049.6s)]
*  because the United States has never been willing to engage diplomatically on that, they really have [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5057.12s)]
*  no intelligence on it. And the likelihood is that if they send a delegation, it's going to be a [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5061.76s)]
*  delegation of men with guns, which isn't going to be the way to get him out. So what's clear is he's [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5066.16s)]
*  not in one of the prisons that was liberated. So he must have been being held on his own, as I say, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5074.08s)]
*  as this sort of very particular prize. And there have been a lot of rumors going around. There have [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5078.8s)]
*  been multiple instances where kind of Syrians have said, oh, we found him. And in one case, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5085.12s)]
*  it was a different American who got lost. In one case, it's someone who has nothing to do with him. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5089.04s)]
*  But it is clear that people realize what a big prize he is. And that it may be that whoever is [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5093.12s)]
*  still holding him, if, as we hope, he's still alive, hopes they can trade him for something. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5100.0s)]
*  But it would also be a fantastic trade for HPS if they're able to liberate him, because they, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5104.48s)]
*  of course, then have a big bargaining chip, or indeed just huge brownie points as a kind of [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5110.64s)]
*  gesture of friendship towards the US government if they're able to hand him over. So as I say, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5116.5599999999995s)]
*  no one's really making efforts on the ground except for fellow journalists to look for him [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5122.4s)]
*  right now. But there is hope that there might be some sort of engagement to try and find out what [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5125.759999999999s)]
*  he is. Because we know that as recently as two years ago, based on prisoners who were being [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5130.32s)]
*  kept with him, he was still as alive and well as you can be after a decade of detainment. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5134.5599999999995s)]
*  God, just hope and pray that he's okay somewhere. And it would be a miracle. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5140.24s)]
*  Last question for you. I mean, it's just, it's been remarkable. It's been unbelievable a couple [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5146.08s)]
*  of weeks, but also just more recently seeing HTS do and say all the things that any Westerner [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5149.84s)]
*  or any minority group in Syria could possibly want them to say. The question just comes down to, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5158.72s)]
*  do minority sects in Syria believe they mean it? Do folks observing them up close believe that they [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5164.88s)]
*  mean what they say and they're not going to sort of fall back on previous iterations of behavior [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5173.36s)]
*  by HTS? I know it's impossible to predict the future, but I'm just curious what you think and [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5178.48s)]
*  what you're hearing from people who might be Alawites or Druze who might not feel protected [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5182.719999999999s)]
*  or safe in a Sunni-led future for Syria. So one of the key issues here, of course, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5188.24s)]
*  is that this organization HTS and indeed all the other rebel groups that they are working with, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5193.36s)]
*  because they're not alone, they're just leading this rebel movement, is not a monolith, right? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5198.639999999999s)]
*  So even though the leader is making these very strong encouraging statements about being liberal, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5202.8s)]
*  about protecting everyone, about women not having to cover, et cetera, that doesn't necessarily mean [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5210.0s)]
*  that the rank and file, all of whom will have joined at different times for different reasons, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5214.4800000000005s)]
*  will necessarily agree with that and there aren't rules in place or a state in place. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5219.28s)]
*  So that is one of the reasons why it's so important to get sort of a new constitution, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5223.360000000001s)]
*  a new framework written up very quickly. So there are rules to follow. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5227.28s)]
*  All the minorities I've spoken to thus far, I've been speaking to Alawites, I've been speaking to [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5232.32s)]
*  various sects of Christians, I've been speaking to Druze, they have all said, look, we were [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5235.599999999999s)]
*  absolutely terrified. These are terrorists because of course HTS was just a new star until 2015. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5240.32s)]
*  When we heard that they were coming, we thought that's it, it's ISIS again, we're going to die. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5248.32s)]
*  And then they arrived and they were completely benign with us. They let us know that the [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5253.6s)]
*  Assad's were gone, that we were free to do as we liked, that we would be looked after. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5259.04s)]
*  Now that's been their lived experience thus far. Of course they are still deeply concerned that [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5263.76s)]
*  things may change. This is all very, very new. But what they have all been saying is, look, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5269.52s)]
*  Assad said he would protect us. What he did was, okay, we're not dead, but we are [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5276.56s)]
*  utterly impoverished. We've been separated from the rest of the Syrian people and watched [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5281.36s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of our people die. And really it was all for nothing. He essentially [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5286.96s)]
*  detracted himself and his family and not us. It was incredible to speak to Alawites the other day [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5291.44s)]
*  in the Alawite heartland near the village where Assad was born saying, good riddance, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5296.08s)]
*  we were just as gagged as anyone else. And we were simply living on a different side of this divide [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5301.44s)]
*  where we all feared death every day and were threatened every day. And all we really want is [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5306.48s)]
*  for all of us to live alongside each other. So there is a genuine investment and hope in that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5310.88s)]
*  A number of people in Damascus said to me, we were expecting these rebels to come down and shoot us [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5316.88s)]
*  all. And all they've done is come here and help us, try and support us as well. I mean, there are [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5320.64s)]
*  lots of examples of these individuals, at least individual fighters, clearly caring deeply about [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5326.72s)]
*  the Syrian people that they're helping with. We were driving back today and there was a family, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5333.28s)]
*  a car full of a family, all packed in there, far too many people. But of course, people are trying [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5337.44s)]
*  to get across the country back to their old homes with very little in the way of resources. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5341.599999999999s)]
*  Their car broke down. And in the pitch black, this HTS fighter jumped off his checkpoint and ran over [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5345.44s)]
*  and helped the teenage boys, the family push the van up the hill until it started moving again. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5353.679999999999s)]
*  Now, of course, these are just little anecdotal moments. They do not in any way demonstrate how [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5358.879999999999s)]
*  a state's going to work. But at least how a lot of these individuals are interacting with Syrians [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5363.2s)]
*  from all over the country does suggest that they feel very Syrian. And I think this is a key issue, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5369.36s)]
*  is that a lot of people say, look, before 2015, as it was then, HTS was largely foreign fighters, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5374.96s)]
*  essentially coming to Syria to conduct jihad because of the chaos. What's changed is that [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5383.599999999999s)]
*  the majority of them are now Syrian. In terms of the recruitment, it's been very interesting [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5388.48s)]
*  talking to HTS fighters about how much has changed over the last four years. It's four years they've [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5393.759999999999s)]
*  been planning this offensive, how they've managed to convince rebels and normal people in the [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5398.639999999999s)]
*  Northwest, men who previously would never have fought with the jihadi groups, that this is [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5403.839999999999s)]
*  the right way to do it and that they do want to accept everyone. And the majority of their makeup [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5408.16s)]
*  now is Syrian. And so they actually do care about and connect with the people in this country as [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5412.72s)]
*  their fellow countrymen. That's what they're trying to demonstrate right now. Thus far, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5419.12s)]
*  it seems to be playing out. There are, of course, concerns. We've heard reports from all over the [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5422.4800000000005s)]
*  place about women being told they won't be allowed to do certain things. There are certain families [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5426.64s)]
*  being held in the Northwest of people who spoke out against HTS who still haven't been released [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5431.04s)]
*  from prison. So there are certainly concerns. But right now, there does seem to be a lot of optimism [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5436.72s)]
*  and as I said, really what people are asking for is some support in that optimism to at least [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5443.04s)]
*  give them a chance. Wow. Leila, well, this is just amazing getting to talk to you from Aleppo. Not [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5447.12s)]
*  something I ever thought I'd get to do. Thank you so much for your reporting and making time for us. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5453.360000000001s)]
*  For folks who don't know, we're connecting at like 11 p.m. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5457.84s)]
*  Syria time via a WhatsApp web connection that somehow worked. So truly thank you again. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5462.56s)]
*  Great to speak with you. And yeah, I am I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to report from Aleppo again [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5468.88s)]
*  either. So it's such a privilege to be here at such a an incredible time in Syrian history. And I [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5473.4400000000005s)]
*  just pray for the best for these wonderful people who've lived for so long a life they didn't deserve [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5478.32s)]
*  and I hope they get the life they do deserve. Absolutely. Amen. Well, thank you again and [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5484.400000000001s)]
*  stay safe and look forward to watching all your stuff on PBS NewsHour and everywhere else. Great [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5488.24s)]
*  to speak to you. Speak to you soon. Thanks again to Leila for doing the show. Happy holidays to [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5492.8s)]
*  everybody. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Wait, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5497.92s)]
*  are we saying Merry Christmas again now? I think we are. Trump got elected. Yeah. I like when [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5503.12s)]
*  every year there's some like kind of nagged dipshit who goes into a Starbucks and tells [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5508.56s)]
*  the barista his name is Christmas and he's like, I got him. Yeah. Good for you, pal. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5512.16s)]
*  You guys win, I guess. Yeah. Merry Christmas on your cup. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5518.16s)]
*  Thank God. Happy everything to everybody. Yeah. And we will be back. Except the haters. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5522.08s)]
*  Except the haters. Well, that's what Trump always does, his messages where he's like, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UUHEvpGLLg&t=5528.48s)]
