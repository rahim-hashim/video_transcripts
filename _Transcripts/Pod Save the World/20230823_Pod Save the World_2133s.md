Video Description: In a special episode, Tommy and Ben talk about the developing story of the alleged deaths of Wagner Group leaders Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin in a plane crash not far from Moscow. All ten people on the private plane were killed and Russian state news agencies reported that both men were on the passenger list – however, there hasn’t yet been confirmation they were onboard. From speculation about air defense missiles shooting down the plane, to claims that Prigozhin was on a different aircraft, Ben and Tommy analyze what this could mean for Wagner forces around the world, Putin’s inner circle, and more.

# Was Putin's Mutinous Warlord Prigozhin Deliberately Killed in a Russian Plane Crash?
**Pod Save the World:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI)
*  Welcome back to another Wagner group focused bonus episode of Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow, Ben quite a day today a lot of news going on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=6.88s)]
*  We got a Republican debate tonight and reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin is dead and get to all that in a minute [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=10.1s)]
*  but we should you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=16.12s)]
*  Quite a quite a day. He too will not be at the debate [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=17.68s)]
*  He's playing hoops with Doug Burgum [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=22.96s)]
*  Okay, so we're obviously we are recording this at 4 p.m. On Wednesday afternoon [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=24.92s)]
*  We want to do something quickly to tell you guys what we know which are here the facts so far [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=29.96s)]
*  So there was a plane crash in Russia [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=34.58s)]
*  Ten people are dead and according to Russian state news agencies the passenger list included [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=36.36s)]
*  Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin who are the leaders of the Wagner group the private Russian mercenary force [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=40.88s)]
*  So we've talked about many times in this show. We're learning about all this in real time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=47.84s)]
*  We're relying on sources like Russian state media [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=51.14s)]
*  Telegram channels that are linked to Wagner group forces [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  So assume this story is going to evolve over time assume that at least some of these early reports are wrong [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  But what's been reported so far is that the jet was carrying ten people three crew members seven passengers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=63.44s)]
*  All of them are dead the Russian Ministry of Emergency Services said it was a private plane [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=68.36s)]
*  Flying from Moscow to st [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=75.04s)]
*  Petersburg in the plane that this specific plane is one that Prigozhin has been linked to in the past a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=76.4s)]
*  Wagner linked telegram channel called gray zone and the gray zone is like a lefty American news outlet [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=81.86s)]
*  Reported that the jet was shot down by air defenses [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=87.54s)]
*  There's some witnesses who said they heard two loud bangs before the plane started going down [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=89.9s)]
*  So that would seem to suggest there was some sort of surface-to-air missile being fired [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=94.34s)]
*  And there's a video on social media that shows the plane tumbling down from the sky and then others [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=98.14s)]
*  Went and videotaped the wreckage then it's worth noting that there's at least one telegram channel saying that these reports are premature and that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=104.18s)]
*  Prigozhin was on a different plane and that plane turned back around time will tell I guess [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=111.5s)]
*  But you know if Prigozhin is dead, I think a lot of observers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=116.88s)]
*  Were surprised that after the mutiny that Prigozhin and the Wagner group staged in late June that he had seemed to go unpunished [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=121.66s)]
*  In July Biden said if I were he I'd be careful what I ate. I'd be keeping my eye on my menu [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=129.5s)]
*  This was during a news conference with Finland's president in July. You pointed to this quote out earlier CIA director [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=134.86s)]
*  Bill Byrne said I think Putin is someone who generally thinks that revenge is a dish best served cold if I were Prigozhin [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=140.82s)]
*  I would fire my food taster a few days ago Prigozhin released a video where he said he was in Africa making Russia even greater [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=146.44s)]
*  On all continents in Africa even more free on July 27th [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=153.78s)]
*  Prigozhin was photographed at a summit in St. Petersburg with some other African leaders the Kremlin said the Putin and Prigozhin met on June 29th [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=157.2s)]
*  Just days after the Wagner group staged a mutiny that got them within 120 miles of Moscow [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  But you know fast forward to today Ben it seems like he might be dead [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=170.1s)]
*  Biden was asked about Prigozhin's death on Wednesday. Here's a quick clip [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=174.04s)]
*  I don't know for a fact [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  What happened I am not surprised [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  Do you think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=188.18s)]
*  Not much that happens when Russia [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=190.74s)]
*  I don't know enough to know these [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=193.74s)]
*  I've been working out for the last hour [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=195.74s)]
*  So that's kind of hard to hear Ben because you couldn't really see the video Biden is coming out of the gym [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  I think he's in California. He's wearing one of those haps half zip sweaters [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  He's holding a smoothie and he gets asked by the press pool and like some parking lot what happened and he's like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't know guys. I've been working out for like half an hour Prigozhin might be dead, but it's leg day [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=211.58s)]
*  So, you know, I got to do what I got to do anyway, then [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=215.02s)]
*  Like this to me is kind of the the definition of shocking but not surprising if Prigozhin is dead [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  But what's your reaction to what we've read so far? Yeah, first of all, the administration really likes food metaphors [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's because Prigozhin's background is a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=230.34s)]
*  Look I I think shocking but not surprising is right because I don't think any of us [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=234.46s)]
*  You know thought that Prigozhin was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=239.5s)]
*  Beyond the reach of retribution here [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=242.38s)]
*  This is a system in which many people tend to have strange one-person active accidents where they fall off of balconies, you know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=244.3s)]
*  That said I mean it did seem to me [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=253.22s)]
*  Like who might have given Prigozhin a little bit more of a lease on life [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=256.38s)]
*  in part maybe to kind of figure out consolidate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=262.06s)]
*  What the Wagner Group's resources are gonna be like Putin's clearly been trying to integrate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=266.68s)]
*  Wagner fighters into the regular army in Ukraine and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=271.24s)]
*  Clearly wouldn't want to lose the levers that he can pull into Africa and in the Middle East through the bargain groups operation. So [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  You know a bit surprising that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=281.44s)]
*  After this kind of period of time in which he was popping up left and right [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=284.16s)]
*  Including a video in recent days where he claimed to be in Africa [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  That he goes down like this I think there are a few things that stand out to me in initial reactions the first is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, it does appear like unless there's a miraculous coincidence of an aviation accident [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  You know that this plane was brought down shot down or something. That's pretty [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  That is pretty brute force, you know to to kill [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=311.96s)]
*  You know reportedly ten people on a plane like that and as we'll get into I think you know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  Wasn't just per Goshen. It seems like there are other members of the Wagner High Command and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=321.44s)]
*  So it feels like not only a message to per Goshen, you know, or at least a message to everyone else who watch per Goshen [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=325.36s)]
*  But also maybe an effort to kind of decapitate a piece at least of the the Wagner Group [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=332.96s)]
*  So pretty dramatic here. This is beyond even just like a one person falling off the balcony thing. This is like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=338.76s)]
*  Let's stick on that for a second [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=344.28s)]
*  I mean, you're right Putin has employed a lot of ways of killing people people fall out of windows [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=345.6s)]
*  Alexei Navalny was poisoned other people are just shot like again, we're kind of speculating here [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  But what kind of message you think it sends to to use an anti-aircraft missile? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=355.4s)]
*  Over Moscow right as a combination of risky [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=361.2s)]
*  Complicated as high profile as you could possibly get like what do you make of that choice? I think there's a couple things [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I mean, this is a plane that was going from Moscow to st. Petersburg, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=370.08s)]
*  so this is like over the heart of Russia and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=373.38s)]
*  It kind of militarizes the manner in which Putin is repressing people and exacting revenge, you know [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=376.14s)]
*  It's a kind of assuming it was shot down. This is like a military operation essentially on Russian soil [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=382.62s)]
*  And that you know, I think foreshadows like an even more brutal and militaristic turn [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=388.58s)]
*  in terms of Putin's repression [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=394.94s)]
*  I think it may speak to the threat he felt from per Goshen and the Wagner group generally that he may have not just killed per [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=397.3s)]
*  Goshen but a bunch of people that were on that plane as well [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=403.78s)]
*  The fact that it took place and we'll get into the fact that he also demoted a very important general [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=408.7s)]
*  Who allegedly knew of the mutiny may have participated in a release knew about it that suggests that this wasn't a gut freak accident [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=414.82s)]
*  Right. This felt coordinated like, you know the same day to demote this general [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=422.82s)]
*  They shoot down this plane [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=426.78s)]
*  The sergei sorokin was the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=429.5s)]
*  Yeah, while Putin is, you know [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=431.73999999999995s)]
*  commemorating this, you know victory of the Red Army over the Nazis in World War two [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  Which is you know striking pretty deep chords in the Russian national memory [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  So there's a lot going on here in terms of this not just being like, you know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=442.82s)]
*  You're typical assassination of a Putin opponent, but you know kind of a militaristic message about who's in charge here [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  I'll say this one thing Tommy like [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  In the initial days of the mutiny [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=457.54s)]
*  You know, there was some hyperbolic commentary. This is the end for Putin, etc [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=461.82s)]
*  Now I think I'm beginning to see some hyperbolic commentary of Putin stronger than ever, you know [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=467.06s)]
*  I'm gonna zag off of that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=473.66s)]
*  I I don't think it's a good thing for Vladimir Putin that there was a military mutiny and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=475.18s)]
*  Then all this uncertainty and then he had to shoot down a plane that includes a longtime close oligarchic [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=480.78s)]
*  Associate of his who commands the most lethal military mercenary force in Russia and beyond [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=486.82s)]
*  That's not like a win for Putin like this is a guy, you know, yes, he's in charge and yes [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  There's nobody, you know, who's poised to that we know of right now [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=499.9s)]
*  Overthrow him but this is a guy who like should be focused on this kind of full-scale invasion [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=504.54s)]
*  He launched of neighboring state who's clearly, you know had to focus on [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  Not just killing per Goshen, but sending a message of paranoia and fear to everybody in the Russian elite to back off [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=515.22s)]
*  To me that that's a system that is cracking actually that's a system that you know is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=522.62s)]
*  Is running out of steam in some ways. It doesn't mean putin's gonna be gone tomorrow at all [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=527.74s)]
*  He's clearly in charge, but I don't know I think this whole episode from from the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=531.1s)]
*  Open fighting between per Goshen and the Russian military to the mutiny itself to this is like this is not how Putin would have drawn up [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=536.9s)]
*  How he wanted his internal politics to look deep into the second year of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=544.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's fair to say that you know, you probably didn't anticipate having to shoot down his own guys [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=550.28s)]
*  I [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=554.82s)]
*  Definitely think this sends a message from Putin. It's like, you know, you guys said I was weekend [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=556.94s)]
*  I'm still here guys, you know, and I just played a trump card [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=561.14s)]
*  It is very weird to me. Look per Goshen could be alive. These reports could all be wrong [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  There's there's this telegram channel saying he was on a different plane that plane turned around went back to st [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=568.9s)]
*  Petersburg I'm not saying I believe that but like we're all open to all possibilities here. We're working with deeply flawed media sources [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=573.36s)]
*  It is very weird to me though that you had this extraordinary event happen over Moscow a plane is shot down or near Moscow and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=579.78s)]
*  State media just immediately produce the flight manifests for a ten person, you know private jet [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, that's interesting and fast and convenient [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=595.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know what it reminded me of is when Navalny was poisoned in the airport [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=598.3399999999999s)]
*  In Siberia and so he's poisoned presumably in the airport and then he [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=605.1s)]
*  You know passes out on the plane has this horrific episode [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=611.02s)]
*  the the video of that of him in the airport like miraculously made it onto [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  Russian media like immediately, you know, and so the fact that you know, they clearly had a plan to get this information out quickly [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=620.6600000000001s)]
*  Again, we don't know if per Goshen pops up alive like man that guy's a legend not in a good way [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=629.42s)]
*  But if this is what it looks like it does feel like they shot this down [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=636.0999999999999s)]
*  They had the information about the passenger manifest out immediately these videos materialized immediately. I'll be it on Wagner channels [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=640.9s)]
*  it seems like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=647.9s)]
*  And yeah, like this is a guy that likes people to know he doesn't come out and announce I've killed this guy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=649.54s)]
*  But he wants people to get the message, you know and message definitely received [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=655.5s)]
*  Above all by you give me progression but but also by the rest of the world and and most importantly [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  I think anybody inside of Russia who might be contemplating a challenge of Putin. Yeah, and I think to the to your question about [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=666.18s)]
*  What does this mean about sort of Putin's relative strength or weakness or strength the weakness of the state? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=672.8599999999999s)]
*  I do think it matters what happens with the rest of these Wagner the Wagner forces [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=677.78s)]
*  I mean it is interesting that he Putin or whoever took out per Goshen waited to do this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=682.4599999999999s)]
*  Until the bulk of the Wagner guys were sitting in Belarus in our you know, it's probably a lot harder to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=687.9s)]
*  You know mountain insurrection 2.0 or march towards Moscow from over there and there are some reports of you know, maybe [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=695.3s)]
*  People walking down the borders in the region like with the way Neapol and other places were a concern about Wagner coming across the border [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  then you mentioned [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=709.5s)]
*  That that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=711.14s)]
*  Pergosians number two was on this flight. It's a guy named Dmitri Utkin. He's a former lieutenant colonel in the GRU [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=712.9s)]
*  He is you know, you often see photo [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=719.26s)]
*  There's one photo of him that's all over the internet where he's a shirt off and you can see [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=722.0600000000001s)]
*  Nazi tattoos on his upper shoulders. He was known to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=725.82s)]
*  Sign his name with two lightning bolts, which was the insignia of the Nazi SS [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=730.62s)]
*  he was like kind of the field commander of the Wagner group and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=734.72s)]
*  Pergosian was the CEO and financier so it really is like the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=738.74s)]
*  The big boss the overseer the guy with the connections to the Russian state who's now dead and the battlefield commander [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=744.5s)]
*  Who is sort of in the trenches leading the leading the troops is now dead and the question I have is [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=751.38s)]
*  Are the remaining Wagner forces loyal to them or are they gonna do something or are they just? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=757.1800000000001s)]
*  Mercenaries for hire who will kind of go along with the next guy. I think that's a big open question [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=765.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean first of all, these are like, you know, this is not a pleasant guy. There's Nazi and you know [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=769.46s)]
*  We we should know like Wagner group because Wagner was Hitler's favorite [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=775.86s)]
*  Not subtle messaging from these guys [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=782.5s)]
*  It's a really really important and good question [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=785.58s)]
*  Because there's both the question again of like our Wagner guy is gonna be in the fight in Ukraine and what happens at the Wagner [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=788.9399999999999s)]
*  network in places like Africa [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  Now what we saw in that mutiny is it seemed like these guys were really loyal to progression because when progression was like hey [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=797.3s)]
*  Let's march on Moscow and shoot down some Russian military helicopters [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=805.18s)]
*  A bunch of guys went with it. Cool boss. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't for Goshen who shot shot down the helicopters, right? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=810.42s)]
*  So that clearly there's some core that is has some degree of loyalty to progression himself [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=816.04s)]
*  I'm most interested in the international operations [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=822.6s)]
*  I'm sure they don't want like to lose the Wagner fighters in Ukraine, but they'll you know draft some more people [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=825.4s)]
*  They'll pull some more convicts out of prison and throw some people as cannon fodder into the fight in Ukraine [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=830.64s)]
*  but there's a pretty complicated network in Africa that encompasses everything from [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=835.92s)]
*  You know essentially running this Central African Republic as a kind of praetorian guard for the president there [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=841.76s)]
*  controlling mining interests [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=849.12s)]
*  Getting close to these coup leaders in the Sahel that we've talked about running very sophisticated disinformation campaigns in parts of Africa [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=851.04s)]
*  controlling media channels [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=859.0799999999999s)]
*  This is not you know, straightforward stuff. And what's interesting is what Wagner allowed [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  Putin to do is have a cutout from the Russian government [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=865.76s)]
*  So it was like, you know if blackwater the US military contractor of Iraq and for me, you know [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=868.28s)]
*  It was doing something and the US government itself wasn't necessarily the one doing it [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  And that means it wasn't the FSB or the Russian military that was running these operations in Africa [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=878.92s)]
*  It strikes me that unless he has like a different person from within Wagner that he can elevate who can kind of keep that machine running [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  It'd be a pretty complicated piece of business to kind of absorb the entire Wagner infrastructure [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=893.0s)]
*  into the Russian state and by the way [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=897.96s)]
*  It would also raise some interesting questions of like under what basis therefore would these Russian troops not Wagner troops be in all these African countries? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=899.88s)]
*  You know that that's a different flavor [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=908.6s)]
*  It may seem like a distinction without difference [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=911.4000000000001s)]
*  But it matters because all of a sudden therefore you have like Russian military occupations of multiple countries [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=913.08s)]
*  Um, so that's the most interesting thing for me to watch in the coming weeks is how do they are they able to absorb this? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  Do they lose some of it that capability? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, uh, are there gonna be defections are gonna be Wagner guys crossing the border into Poland? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=929.24s)]
*  Um, you know, there's a lot that has to play out here [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=934.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=937.48s)]
*  I think it's worth remembering that the breaking point for pregozhin that led to the Wagner group mutiny [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=937.64s)]
*  Was the Russian ministry of defense saying that all Wagner forces had to sign a contract with the Russian military and essentially get absorbed [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=944.28s)]
*  Into the ministry of defense's operations which would have stripped all of pregozhin's power away [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=952.76s)]
*  Uh, and it seems like that's what ultimately led him to lead this ill-fated march on Moscow [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=958.52s)]
*  But ben, you know a lot of folks in the pod save the world discord [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=963.88s)]
*  We're asking a version of the question like what happens to the Wagner group now what happened to their operations in africa? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=967.24s)]
*  um, I also you know sort of imagined this from [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=973.88s)]
*  Like the african junta leader point of view imagine if you're sitting in molly or brachina fasso or niger [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=977.72s)]
*  Where you're kind of waiting for uh wagner forces to ride to the rescue [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=984.36s)]
*  Uh, because you just started this coup a few weeks ago and you probably need some help by now [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=988.52s)]
*  They must be wondering like what what's going on because you know, you there's no way that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=993.24s)]
*  That putin would risk an operation like this by like communicating [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=998.28s)]
*  In advance to some of these, uh wagner proxies around the world like hey some shit's gonna go down hang tight [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1003.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the ones in ukraine, you know [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1010.38s)]
*  Given how much room russian military presence there is there I I assume that their ability to kind of absorb and swallow up [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1013.74s)]
*  Any russians with guns in ukraine? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1019.98s)]
*  Um is something they can do now to be clear though [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1022.38s)]
*  That's not how this war started like putin has created these different fiefdoms over time the military [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1025.5s)]
*  The gru the fsb intelligence service the wagner group kadira the chechen [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1030.7s)]
*  Uh warlord essentially with his own guys and at the beginning of the war there all these different forces were fighting and operating in ukraine [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1036.3s)]
*  Clearly they decided to try to consolidate that that makes sense [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1043.18s)]
*  But you know, they're building that plane while they're flying it as it were in this, you know war in ukraine [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1046.14s)]
*  That's not gone exactly as they wanted it to go [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1051.02s)]
*  But there I think you know [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1053.42s)]
*  They're they're seeking to kind of impose russian military command order over things and will probably be able to do so they may just lose [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1055.1s)]
*  a bit of capability in in that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1062.7s)]
*  um, I think you know by the way [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1065.5s)]
*  That's a risk for putin away too because one of the reasons why he liked all these fiefdoms is he didn't like anybody to get [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1067.42s)]
*  Too strong who might challenge him? So if he's beginning to centralize command, you know, then all of a sudden [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1072.06s)]
*  You know the generals might uh become a threat to putin sometime down the line as they get stronger the africa piece. Um, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1077.74s)]
*  I don't that to me is the mystery because like the um [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1085.02s)]
*  Now I imagine, you know, they're they're Wagner guys that are currently in these countries just doing what they're doing [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1088.62s)]
*  But you know imagine being a Wagner guy [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1094.3s)]
*  Um, a lot of these guys are like long-standing relationships loyal to progozhen [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1097.1s)]
*  And you you know, you check your telegram channel and you find out your boss just got like backed in a plane crash [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1101.1s)]
*  Uh, it might be kind of tempting to just like, you know grab some of the stuff from the mines and disappear [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  Here [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1110.86s)]
*  Grab a couple giant diamonds and get out. I'm not sure i'd want to be hanging out waiting for my new commander [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1112.06s)]
*  You know [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1116.86s)]
*  so again [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1117.58s)]
*  The best case scenario for putin is that he somehow has some other person who's high up in the Wagner thing that he's he has [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1118.78s)]
*  Been working with him, uh, who's set to take the the helm here, but I have to imagine at a minimum [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1123.5s)]
*  It's disruptive for them. Yeah, there might be some new listeners to the show today [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1128.86s)]
*  Just to remind you who uh, yvgeny progozhen is this was a guy who spent uh nearly a decade in prison when he was younger [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1133.1s)]
*  For choking a woman during a robbery when he got out. He started selling hot dogs [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1139.6599999999999s)]
*  He got into the supermarket catering and restaurant business in st. Petersburg. That's where he met and started working with putin [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1144.3s)]
*  That's why people call him putin chef. There's literally photos of progozhen serving food to world leaders including george w bush [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1150.46s)]
*  Later progozhen started the wagner group and he had his mercenaries fighting in ukraine and syria and all across africa [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1158.78s)]
*  But he's also grown this massive business empire that stretches across, you know more than a dozen countries [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1165.4199999999998s)]
*  The new york times did a big investigation into all his various shell companies and the intermediaries [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1170.86s)]
*  They include a chocolate museum in st. Petersburg a gold mine in the central african republic oil and gas ventures [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1175.6599999999999s)]
*  Off the syrian coast there's movies. There's beer. There's vodka. There's timber. There's mining. There's diamond [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1183.02s)]
*  He was also indicted by a federal grand jury [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1188.4599999999998s)]
*  In the united states for interfering in the 2016 election through the internet research agency that troll farm that we all remember from 2016 [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1191.1s)]
*  Uh, he was sanctioned by the u.s again for activities in crimia. This is a guy who was recruiting [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1198.86s)]
*  Uh out of prisons and basically getting these untrained men to sign up to join the wagner group [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1206.3s)]
*  And he was throwing them at the front lines in bakmoud as cannon fodder. So, you know, he has this [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1212.3799999999999s)]
*  Sprawling business empire it extends beyond the wagner group to all these other places [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  And now it does just sort of lead the question to what happens to all of it. We have no idea [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1223.02s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a very off books kind of thing, right? So like, you know, they'll [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1228.06s)]
*  They'll help take over, you know oil fields in syria and then they'll take a 20 cut from like the you know [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1233.26s)]
*  the revenue or I met I met a syrian recently who [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1240.1399999999999s)]
*  Had left his hometown because like the russians took over the port and were kind of running the business [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1244.3s)]
*  Uh at the port and I can't imagine that those guys are you know? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1250.38s)]
*  Using regular accounting here, you know, so your kid's probably not going to be like hey [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1254.78s)]
*  Can I please have the deed to the chocolate factory? Uh, yeah, exactly. There's not a bookkeeper for this kind of stuff. So [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1258.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like it's it's an illicit [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1265.34s)]
*  Mercenary empire and so that's a harder thing to kind of wrest control of than [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1267.66s)]
*  You know the operations of like a military unit per se [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1272.06s)]
*  But clearly putin felt like this is it didn't matter like even if he you know suffers some complications in managing that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1275.58s)]
*  He could not allow this guy to live. Uh, he wanted to send this message. He wanted to do it relatively quickly [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1283.74s)]
*  after the mutiny and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1289.4199999999998s)]
*  You know here we are. Uh, you know [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1290.9399999999998s)]
*  Lots to wonder what the next chapter is here. You mentioned this at the top end [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1293.1799999999998s)]
*  So while this was happening putin was at a concert commemorating world war ii [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1297.02s)]
*  In the kurtz region near ukraine [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1302.94s)]
*  What do we make of I think that's a coincidence that putin's like giving a speech at this massive sort of terrifying looking memorial [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1305.58s)]
*  As the the split screen is you know, uh pergosian's plane swirling down and crashing on the ground [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1312.94s)]
*  So again, we don't know what's in putin's head [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1320.06s)]
*  We don't know exactly even what happened here if I were to guess in this kind of you know, I think biden's point [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1323.02s)]
*  uh with the smoothie in hand that that stuff doesn't happen in russia without putin knowing or [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1328.7s)]
*  in coincidence to me the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1334.12s)]
*  The most likely scenario is that this was orchestrated you've got putin [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1337.02s)]
*  commemorating a battle where the red army defeated nazi germany putin wants to associate himself with the legacy of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1341.4s)]
*  strong and great russian leaders, um [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1349.18s)]
*  And including importantly the victory over [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1351.98s)]
*  nazi germany and he's cast the ukrainians as the latest flavor of nazis that have to be vanquished on behalf of kind of the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1356.4599999999998s)]
*  russian empire [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1362.22s)]
*  So there he is kind of playing the role of the russian strongman the embodiment of the russian state the embodiment of this [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1363.26s)]
*  You know history that included great sacrifice militarily the russian army obviously the red army lost millions and millions of people in war two [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1371.02s)]
*  Uh dwarfing even the losses they have in ukraine while he's doing that he's demoting [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1379.42s)]
*  Like the general who is disloyal and literally killing [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  the guy that challenged him that feels like [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1388.3s)]
*  Like a vogner-esque symphony. Yeah [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1392.46s)]
*  It's a hell of a coincidence [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1395.66s)]
*  Otherwise, it's a hell of a coincidence. Yeah, um, uh someone on discord named brava sentari [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1397.98s)]
*  Asks imagine you're sitting at your desk at the white house when news like this breaks [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1403.26s)]
*  What's the first thing you do the second? How does the day play out differently if it does at all great question [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1407.26s)]
*  I mean you got to figure that jake solvin or the deputy national security advisor john feiner is immediately calling some sort of [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1413.42s)]
*  Situation room meeting where you're getting together the state department all the intel agencies [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1421.32s)]
*  Uh and just saying what do we know? They're all probably checking twitter [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1426.3799999999999s)]
*  Is the truth at least for the first 24 hours before you can kind of [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1430.46s)]
*  Actually covertly reach out to sources in a safe way or collect some or mine all the intelligence that's been collected through signals intelligence [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1434.94s)]
*  in a way that actually [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1442.86s)]
*  Shows you something, but I don't know [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1444.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look look [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1447.1s)]
*  You know after the annexation of krymia and the you know, russian move into eastern ukraine in the obama years [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1449.4199999999998s)]
*  There were incidents like the shoot down of a dutch passenger plane [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1455.4199999999998s)]
*  mh-17 over ukraine [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1459.98s)]
*  Where or the sat-station force nemsa? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1462.3s)]
*  That we talked about another russia where I remember like yeah, like you described [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1465.1s)]
*  You you just go into the situation room. There's like a kind of standard the deputies meeting [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1468.78s)]
*  You know the the deputies of all the agencies and the nsc [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1473.02s)]
*  Gather in the situation room [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1476.06s)]
*  And a lot of that and it becomes kind of an open-ended rolling meeting where you're gathering information [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1477.98s)]
*  And to your point like okay [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1484.8s)]
*  So what are they doing like part of it is monitoring the media monitoring twitter a lot of this stuff is popping up on telegram [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1486.24s)]
*  part of it is [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1491.52s)]
*  Asking the intelligence community to go through everything that they know and what they don't know like, you know [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1493.12s)]
*  Did we see any indication that this was going to happen? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1497.2s)]
*  Has there been any intelligence in the last couple days about? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1499.76s)]
*  That the foreshadow of this they're definitely reaching out to the ukrainians. Uh, so i'm sure that they're making a plan like, you know [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1503.04s)]
*  Call the ukrainians. Like what do they know? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1509.36s)]
*  Is there anything they know about this what do they think is going on here? Did you see one of uh, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1512.0s)]
*  One of the top ukrainian advisor just linked to the song highway to hell and that was just on twitter [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was good ukrainian trolling. They love that shit [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1523.04s)]
*  But also like this africa piece I bet comes up too [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1527.52s)]
*  So I I think that they they're probably also like trying to surge resources [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1530.24s)]
*  You know diplomatic intelligence resources to try to understand is this going to have any impact in the next you know? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1534.32s)]
*  Couple days in terms of what we're seeing around vogn operations in africa [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1539.84s)]
*  So the the first day when something like this happens a lot of it is about like [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1544.6399999999999s)]
*  How do we piece together as much information as we can? Who do we need to be in touch with? You know [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1550.0s)]
*  You know african leaders [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1555.84s)]
*  ukrainians europeans liaison intelligence services [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1558.3799999999999s)]
*  What is our public comment on this and and the nsc comment was kind of like, you know, we've seen the reports [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not surprising and that was like a it was kind of a ukrainian style troll albeit not quite as uh, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1568.08s)]
*  You know, yeah, the acdc, you know, it was adrian watson [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1574.64s)]
*  She said uh, the administration has seen the reports about the plane crash in russia if confirmed. No one should be surprised [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1577.44s)]
*  Yeah, so it makes for a more interesting day [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1584.0s)]
*  But the reality is it's not like we are a player in this, you know, we're not [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1586.32s)]
*  Inside the russian system. I mean maybe a lot of reaching out to russia experts people, you know [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1590.48s)]
*  Just trying to gather information as you can. Yeah, um, I will be very interested to watch in the coming days [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1595.36s)]
*  how [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1601.84s)]
*  russian state media responds [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1602.72s)]
*  For a while prugosian was you know, kind of like a a hero in sort of the military blogger set [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1605.2s)]
*  He was celebrated. You know a lot of the the wagner group's victories were celebrated on state tv [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1611.52s)]
*  That turned pretty quickly when he launched an insurrection against muska against latimer putin, but it'll be worth watching [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1616.72s)]
*  How they talk about what happened to him whether you know putin is given credit publicly on tv, you know [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1623.0400000000002s)]
*  You and I sort of speculate on this. We don't have you know, we're not doing any we don't have uh, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1629.92s)]
*  Ann seltzer doing iowa polls in russia for us to figure out these things [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1634.4s)]
*  But it seemed like prugosian might be pretty popular [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1638.0800000000002s)]
*  Among sort of like rank pile russians because he kind of talks like a real human being and was on the front lines [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1641.92s)]
*  Filming these videos and cursing out the elites that everybody probably hates so it's important to see how this kind of unfolds [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1647.6s)]
*  Yeah, and we've talked about that far right, you know military blogger, you know [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1654.8799999999999s)]
*  Set of people and putin recently had one of those guys tossed in prison pretty prominent guy that was part of the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1659.76s)]
*  support for separatists in eastern ukraine and like [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1665.84s)]
*  What's their reaction is there is there you know, you want to look for any inkling of any backlash to this? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1668.32s)]
*  Um from the russian far right, you know [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1673.28s)]
*  Ultra nationalist right is someone going to try to make a play to be the new prugosian and be taped videos like, you know [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1675.92s)]
*  It is [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1682.08s)]
*  It's not like totally risk-free for pudin [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1683.28s)]
*  um, I don't think he's gonna face a mutiny anytime soon, but like [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1685.36s)]
*  You know does does the kind of sentiment that prugosian tapped into this frustration with the russian military command and the conduct of the war? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1689.12s)]
*  Combined with this kind of ultra toxic masculinity russian nationalism like are other people gonna make a play to be that person? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  So you'd be looking at all that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1703.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1705.52s)]
*  And the last thing i'm sort of interested to see is or I bet a lot of people are wondering is what impact [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1705.76s)]
*  Might this have on the war in ukraine? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1710.96s)]
*  my understanding from listening to [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1713.6s)]
*  Military experts and I don't ever pretend to be one [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1716.16s)]
*  Is that the the waggoner forces were mostly doing offensive operations in places like bakhmut? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1719.04s)]
*  And then largely were kind of pulled off the battlefield a lot of the the most experienced guys [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1725.04s)]
*  I think are now up in belarus. So I don't know that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1729.68s)]
*  You know the russian forces are about to lose a lot of guys if you know [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1733.76s)]
*  The the waggoner forces pack up and leave at this point [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1737.36s)]
*  I think the russian military has kind of dug in a lot of these trenches and they're doing defensive operations, but who knows? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1740.08s)]
*  We'll find out [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1746.16s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you know bakhmut like I it's it's interesting how much russian manpower may have left bakhmut [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1747.68s)]
*  I think on the russian military front [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1754.0s)]
*  um [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1756.08s)]
*  The syrovkin the general who got you know shit canned or [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1757.12s)]
*  Uh and may have his own accident, I don't know, you know, he by all accounts [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1761.04s)]
*  Had been pretty effective, you know, uh and coming in and helping to kind of create these defensive lines and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1766.72s)]
*  and so, you know when you're [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1773.4399999999998s)]
*  when you're [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1775.6s)]
*  losing uh prugosian and his guys and you're demoting this general and probably taking him off the field like [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  That may have some impact over time, right? Um in terms of [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1783.28s)]
*  Uh the conduct of the war but that's probably not something you're gonna see quickly [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1787.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1792.1599999999999s)]
*  I should say ben that uh one of the discord questioners who asked about how this internet's being sort of reported and viewed in russia [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1792.72s)]
*  Uh has the name hannah worldo [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1800.1599999999999s)]
*  9981 on discord which I know that's not my wife because she spells it with two h's and she doesn't listen to this show [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1803.34s)]
*  But um, you know, we really appreciate you being a part of the discord community here hannah. Thank you hannah. Yeah [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1809.76s)]
*  Or uh, you know hannah, uh who works with me a friend of the potter's. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, it could be your hand [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1814.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah hannah vitor is kind of like, I don't know man. I like I like keeping [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1820.64s)]
*  I can't see you're slipping into the discord. No, no, no, um, well, that's all I got obviously we did this [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1825.2s)]
*  Very quickly because we I don't know just wanted to talk about what we knew [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1831.52s)]
*  I imagine we might do more bonus content than on thursday or friday if there's more to report or just dig deep on on [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1835.04s)]
*  For wednesday of next week, but anything else you want to add before we wrap? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1842.56s)]
*  I think the only thing i'd say is like part of what's interesting is we live in this kind of crazy, you know new cycle stuff [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1845.84s)]
*  and um [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1852.3999999999999s)]
*  You know the war has been going on the full-scale invasion was february 22nd. So it's been like a year and a half [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1853.6s)]
*  And just think about how much stuff has changed like how many surprises there have been how many twists and turns it's a reminder [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1859.84s)]
*  you know that [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1867.4399999999998s)]
*  Stuff that was unthinkable six months ago like the idea that vogner would march on moscow [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1869.28s)]
*  And then purgosian be shot down in a plane if I told you, you know, that's not totally surprising today to learn that news [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1874.96s)]
*  But if I told you, you know at the beginning of this calendar year, hey, guess what's gonna happen? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1881.2s)]
*  Um, you'd be like what the fuck so I think it's a reminder that whether we're talking about [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1886.32s)]
*  The battlefield state in ukraine or the state of russia's internal politics [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1890.96s)]
*  This is when you start a war like this [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1895.44s)]
*  You don't know how it's going to end putin doesn't know how it's going to end and and I that's why I want to end on [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  like this note of like because I was reading these takes of like well i'll actually know like putin was stronger than ever like [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1901.6000000000001s)]
*  uh, you know [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot this this suggests a degree [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1909.0400000000002s)]
*  of uncertainty inside of russian politics [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1912.16s)]
*  Yes, putin is the strong man on top of a bunch of corrupt rotted out fiefdoms [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  But this is not like a cohesive system that is functioning. You know, there's not like a political party [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1919.5200000000002s)]
*  This is not like the the communist party of china or the old soviet politburo [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1924.96s)]
*  This is putin sitting on top of an elite that is made up of a bunch of self-interested [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1929.0400000000002s)]
*  Corrupt motherfuckers. Yeah, like you give me pergosian and [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1934.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know like I I wouldn't be buying stock in that system right now [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1939.2s)]
*  Um when planes are getting shot down, I also think it's kind of this mafia style hit right like [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1942.88s)]
*  And there's something about the guy going down on a private jet. It's kind of a metaphor for the entire russian oligarchy [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1949.2800000000002s)]
*  You know like he's got the private jet, but he still gets shot down by bazaar [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1954.08s)]
*  Yeah, the mega yacht would be the only like sort of better example. Yeah, I i'm with you. Um [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1958.64s)]
*  Putin is a mob boss [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1964.08s)]
*  You know [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1965.92s)]
*  He's sort of got all these like capos that he's you know [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1966.32s)]
*  Allows to operate and fight each other because it kind of keeps him on top and he just took one out [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1969.2s)]
*  But yeah, there's there's a lot of risk to that. I guess [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1974.0s)]
*  listeners might ask or wonder why do you guys uh dunk on the vague ramaswami so hard because you hate the blob [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1976.56s)]
*  But you hate the kind of like boring standard national security people and he's at least trying to say things differently [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1984.0s)]
*  And for me it's because he's just so unbelievably [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1988.8s)]
*  Arrogant and like doesn't know what he doesn't know and if anything four years in the white house taught me it's [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1992.7s)]
*  Humility and how little control you actually have even when you're the president of the united states and how unpredictable world events are [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=1998.3s)]
*  So i'm with you like anyone offering a hot take on twitter [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2004.24s)]
*  Who thinks they know exactly how things are going to play out from here? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2007.92s)]
*  Like you they're full of shit unfollow that no [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2010.96s)]
*  That's a really good point just to dunk on the vague one more time before the debate [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2014.0s)]
*  Like because keep in mind what the vague has been arguing which is something by the way [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2017.52s)]
*  We're gonna hear more of which is that his argument is literally we should give putin like the chunk of ukraine [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2020.8799999999999s)]
*  He has in exchange for a deal in which he breaks his military alliance with china and makes him deal with us like [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2026.56s)]
*  This that that presumes if vladimir putin is [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2032.96s)]
*  Trustworthy, yeah [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's like the guy in like a vc tech deal with the vape right a rational actor with this guy [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2037.6799999999998s)]
*  He's like a brutal megalomaniac, you know [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2042.9599999999998s)]
*  And so the conversation has to take that into account and to be yes to be clear [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2046.32s)]
*  I learned that the hard way over eight years, you know, we tried to do self-interested rational deals with putin and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2051.36s)]
*  what you learn at the end of the day is [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2057.36s)]
*  like [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2059.44s)]
*  This is not a this is this guy [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  Is about one thing and one thing only which is his own power and his own kind of dreams of grandeur [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2063.28s)]
*  And anything in his way is gonna get plowed over and that's why I think you have to be quite skeptical of [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2069.28s)]
*  The efficacy of that kind of diplomacy with somebody like this. Yeah. Yeah, 5d chest doesn't really work with someone like Vladimir Putin [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2074.96s)]
*  Um, all right. Well, that's it for us for today. Uh, if there's more [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbQHVc8bRmI&t=2081.12s)]
