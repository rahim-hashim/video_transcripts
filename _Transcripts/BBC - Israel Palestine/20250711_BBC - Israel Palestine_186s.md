Video Description: Doctors have warned of an imminent disaster at Gaza's largest functioning hospital because of critical shortage of fuel and a widening Israeli ground offensive in the southern city of Khan Younis.
 
Nasser Medical Complex was forced to stop admitting patients on Thursday, when witnesses said Israeli troops and tanks advanced into a cemetery 200m (660ft) away and fired towards nearby camps for displaced families.
 
The forces reportedly withdrew on Friday after digging up several areas.
 
Medical staff and dozens of patients in intensive care remain inside the hospital, where the fuel shortage threatens to shut down life-saving services.
 
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. However, it said on Friday morning that an armoured brigade was operating in Khan Younis to dismantle "terrorist infrastructure sites" and confiscate weapons. 
It has previously issued evacuation orders for the areas around the hospital.
The UN Human rights office has also said almost 800 people have been killed while trying to receive food aid in Gaza, since late May.

**BBC - Israel Palestine:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU)
*  Hello and welcome to Verified Live. We start in Gaza with many elements to update you on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=0.0s)]
*  The main hospital first of all still functioning in the Gaza Strip has said it has had to stop receiving casualties since last night after it was encircled by Israeli forces. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=7.0s)]
*  Staff at the NASA hospital in Khan Unis said tanks had come within meters and equipment was shutting down because of a lack of fuel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=17.0s)]
*  A US medical team there said snipers appeared to be firing on people inside the compound. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=25.0s)]
*  It's now been reported Israeli troops are pulling back with the hospital assessing whether it can re-admit patients. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=31.0s)]
*  It comes after Wednesday's attack when at least 15 people, including eight children, were killed after an Israeli airstrike on a medical facility in central Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=38.0s)]
*  Local officials said most of the victims were mothers and children queuing for food aid and nutritional supplements. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=48.0s)]
*  Israel says it was targeting a Hamas gunman involved in the October 7 attacks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=55.0s)]
*  Well, the UN Human Rights Office also says almost 800 people have now been killed while trying to receive food aid in Gaza since late May. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=61.0s)]
*  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Emir Nader, has more. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=71.0s)]
*  Palestinians have said on the ground in terms of the fact that when they've gone to seek aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation points, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=75.0s)]
*  which is this new controversial US and Israeli backed mechanism for delivering aid, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=84.0s)]
*  sites where Palestinians must go to to retrieve boxes, it's been criticised as being an extremely militarised and humiliating system of distributing aid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=89.0s)]
*  Palestinians there have said that they are regularly coming under Israeli fire and hospitals as well are recording bullets, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=101.0s)]
*  embodies, bullet injuries from those who have said they've been going to seek aid. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=111.0s)]
*  We have at times seen the Israeli military acknowledge that they have fired upon Palestinians seeking aid and saying that they will review their processes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=115.0s)]
*  But we are daily hearing about deaths at those aid distribution points. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=126.0s)]
*  And in fact, the distribution of aid has become one of the key sticking points during the ceasefire negotiations that are happening in Qatar, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=132.0s)]
*  with the Israeli side pushing for the continuation of this model, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=140.0s)]
*  whereas the Hamas side are calling for a return for the role of the United Nations, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=144.0s)]
*  who for the majority of the world were distributing aid in the community rather than forcing Palestinians to go to those sites. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=150.0s)]
*  The Israeli side have accused that model of leading aid, of allowing aid to be diverted by Hamas, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=159.0s)]
*  whereas the United Nations has said for their part that they've been presented and seen no evidence of that taking place on a systematic basis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=167.0s)]
*  But yes, this is a critical issue, the issue of aid, and currently we're seeing just one functioning aid distribution point in Gaza for its two million residents. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV53cu52zcU&t=174.0s)]
