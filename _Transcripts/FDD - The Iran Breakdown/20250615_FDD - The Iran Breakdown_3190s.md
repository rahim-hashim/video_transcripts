# The Iran Breakdown | SITREP with Mark Dubowitz feat. Barak Ravid and Nadav Eyal
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c)
*  They're working on the delivery system not just to hit Israel or Europe, they want to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=0.0s)]
*  hit continental United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=11.08s)]
*  Can't allow that to happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=12.52s)]
*  The Islamic Republic means what it says when it says death to Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=13.52s)]
*  Eventually we will attack Iran's nuclear facility because there's no other choice. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=16.68s)]
*  Israel cannot allow Iran to go nuclear. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=21.6s)]
*  Israel is committed to defend ourselves by ourselves and we will do whatever it takes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=23.52s)]
*  with whatever we have so that Iran does not become a nuclear power. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=27.779999999999998s)]
*  This is the Iran Breakdown. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=30.98s)]
*  So let's break it down. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=32.5s)]
*  So welcome to the Iran Breakdown. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=39.78s)]
*  I'm your host, Mark Dubowitz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  The war in the Middle East has entered a new and very dangerous phase. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  Israeli strikes have directly targeted the Islamic Republic's nuclear military and security [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=46.22s)]
*  infrastructure and decapitated key figures in the IRGC high command as well as nuclear [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=50.46s)]
*  weapons scientists. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=55.94s)]
*  Iran has responded with what it has long threatened, direct ballistic missile attacks on Israel, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=57.54s)]
*  including multiple strikes on densely populated city centers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=62.62s)]
*  While Israel is issuing warnings for Iranian civilians to stay away from military nuclear [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=67.38s)]
*  sites, in contrast, Khamenei has given direct orders to fire on Israeli civilians. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=72.58s)]
*  This is no longer a shadow war, it's open confrontation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=78.02s)]
*  On this special sit rep, I'll be joined by two leading journalists to help break it all [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=81.3s)]
*  down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=85.1s)]
*  First, joining me live from Washington is Barack Ravid. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  He's the global affairs correspondent for Axios and a CNN analyst. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=88.74s)]
*  We're going to focus on the US angle. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=93.02s)]
*  Where does the Trump administration stand? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=95.06s)]
*  How is the war impacting their nuclear diplomacy? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=97.22s)]
*  And what would it take for the United States to join Israel in a direct strike on Iran's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=100.06s)]
*  most fortified nuclear sites? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  We're going to then turn to Nadav Yel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=107.58s)]
*  He's a senior columnist at Yediut Aharonot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=110.02s)]
*  We're going to go deep on the Israeli side. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=112.3s)]
*  What's the real damage assessment inside Iran? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=114.62s)]
*  How far did Israeli infiltration go to enable such surgical operations? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=117.42s)]
*  And what is the IDF's current freedom of movement? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=121.98s)]
*  And what's next? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=124.26s)]
*  And how are Israelis processing a night of mass missiles fired on their homes? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=125.54s)]
*  So with all of that, let's break it down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=130.3s)]
*  Hey, Barack, welcome. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=139.18s)]
*  Hey, Mark, how's it going? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=140.58s)]
*  Good, Barack. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  I know how busy you are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=143.78s)]
*  You're a journalist in demand, breaking lots of great stories for Axios. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=144.78s)]
*  I want to go after the story on the US side. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you've got great sources in the US government and you're monitoring what's going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=152.14s)]
*  on with the Trump administration. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  And you've broken some really interesting stories in recent days. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  So let's jump right in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=160.54s)]
*  Where is President Trump right now on this war between Israel and Islamic Republic? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=162.1s)]
*  Well, you know, we always need to look at what President Trump said last. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=167.7s)]
*  And the last thing he said, which was seven hours ago, he posted on his true social account [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=175.18s)]
*  this comment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=183.94s)]
*  The US had nothing to do with the attack on Iran tonight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=184.94s)]
*  If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=189.22s)]
*  US armed forces will come down on you at levels you've never seen before. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=194.58s)]
*  However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel and end this bloody conflict. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=199.78s)]
*  I think at the moment, it seems to me, I don't know at the moment, as of seven years, seven [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=207.94s)]
*  hours ago, it seemed that Trump doesn't want the US to get actively involved in the war, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=214.5s)]
*  even though the Israeli government is putting, I would say, quite extensive pressure on the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration, especially on parts of the Trump administration that are more [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=233.58s)]
*  favorable to getting involved in this war, to join in, especially in order to take out [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=236.94s)]
*  the Fordo nuclear facility, nuclear enrichment facility, the heavily fortified facility [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=244.02s)]
*  inside the mountain that Israel can maybe try and damage, but it can't really destroy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=249.9s)]
*  because it doesn't have either the huge bunker buster bombs that are needed for such an [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=256.42s)]
*  operation or the strategic bombers to carry them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=263.1s)]
*  The US has both, and they're in flying distance from Iran in the Diego Garcia air base in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=266.5s)]
*  the Indian Ocean. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=274.82s)]
*  So I think this is what's really happening behind the scenes over the last 24 hours, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=276.58s)]
*  significant pressure from the Israelis on the Trump administration to join in. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=283.58s)]
*  And the Israelis are basically saying, at least what I hear from Israeli officials is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=289.38s)]
*  saying, we think we don't have a lot of time left. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=293.78s)]
*  They think that it's between 24 to 48 hours before maybe Donald Trump will say, that's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  it, I had enough. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=304.98s)]
*  So what they're saying to the Trump administration, okay, if it's 24 to 48 hours, and if you want [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program to go away, then in those 24 to 48 hours, we need to do something [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=314.98s)]
*  significant or more significant than we did so far. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  And in order to do that, we need you to join in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  So basically, the Israeli argument is, as by the way, we saw in previous cases like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=328.22s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, is escalation for de-escalation, meaning the US goes in, take out the Fordo [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=336.18s)]
*  nuclear facility in order to basically after that say, all right, we're done. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=344.54s)]
*  Now let's negotiate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=351.06s)]
*  I don't know where Donald Trump is going to land on this thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=353.34s)]
*  I'm waiting anxiously, I'm refreshing his true social account by the minute. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=358.5s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, Barack, you also broke a story that Trump had a conversation with Vladimir Putin [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  to get Russia's involvement in trying to convince Iran to come back to the negotiations. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=372.5s)]
*  Essentially, it seems to me that there's sort of a choice between Oman and Fordo. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=377.94s)]
*  Either Khamenei decides to send his lead negotiator, Arakchi, back to Oman for another round of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=384.29999999999995s)]
*  negotiations or something has to get done at Fordo, as you said, in really destroying [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=390.46s)]
*  this last remaining major element of Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  Is that how you see it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=401.38s)]
*  What have you been reporting on the chances of renewed diplomacy in Oman? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=403.1s)]
*  So I'll tell you what I heard. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=408.58s)]
*  I think it's very interesting because it's not what the Iranians are saying publicly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=412.06s)]
*  Publicly, the Iranians are saying no point of negotiating with the US. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=417.02s)]
*  The US is part of this attack. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=422.62s)]
*  Therefore, negotiations are futile. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=424.74s)]
*  In private, the Iranians have been telling people, especially foreign ministers from [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=427.38s)]
*  other countries, that once they feel that their retaliation to the Israeli attack is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=433.06s)]
*  over, then they will resume negotiations. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=439.7s)]
*  And if that's the case, then the Iranians can decide at any moment that their retaliation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=444.82s)]
*  is over and resume negotiations. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=448.94s)]
*  And I think that in some ways, the only way for Iran to stop the Israeli strikes is to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=451.94s)]
*  resume talks with the US. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=460.18s)]
*  At the moment, I don't know if that's the only way, but it's definitely the best way. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=461.94s)]
*  So if the supreme leader or President Pesach Kian or Foreign Minister Arakchi want to stop [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=469.42s)]
*  spending their night in the bunker, getting reports about how many of their assets have [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=478.82s)]
*  been targeted by the Israeli Air Force, the best way to do it, in my opinion, OK, I'm [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=485.5s)]
*  not saying it because I know that's really just my opinion, is to call Steve Witkoff [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=491.82s)]
*  and tell him, you know what, we can meet in 12 hours in Rome or in, I don't know, where [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=497.94s)]
*  Vienna or Muscat or wherever. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=504.94s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure that Witkoff would then call President Trump and say, listen, the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  Iranians want to meet immediately. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=513.78s)]
*  And Trump, I'm pretty sure, would tell him, OK, go on your jet and get over there. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=516.26s)]
*  And the next thing Trump will do is call Netanyahu and tell him, Witkoff is meeting the Iranians, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=521.78s)]
*  so I expect you to stop. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=527.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=529.34s)]
*  I mean, you had reported before all of this began that there had been a US offer to Iran. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=530.34s)]
*  It was quite, in my view, quite a generous offer. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=535.26s)]
*  I mean, it allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium, at least, quote, temporarily, while [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=537.82s)]
*  there was some idea about building this consortium, this joint enrichment facility. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I thought that was kind of a diplomatic fiction that it would never get built and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  that Khamenei would actually be able to retain enrichment capability, wait out Donald Trump, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=552.46s)]
*  and in three and a half years' time be able to use that nuclear enrichment capability [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=556.38s)]
*  to really expand it and go for a weapon. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  It's quite a generous offer that Khamenei actually turned down. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  Do you expect if there are renewed talks in Oman that that offer will be revised significantly, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=567.14s)]
*  given the fact that Iran is much, much weaker than it was just a week ago? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=574.14s)]
*  I just think that, you know, practically this offer cannot be on the table anymore because [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=578.54s)]
*  what this offer talked about is basically shutting down or, you know, I don't want to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=584.74s)]
*  say shutting down because that's not the language in the proposal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=590.34s)]
*  The proposal spoke about making the underground enrichment facilities non-operational and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=594.82s)]
*  keeping only the above the ground Natanz enrichment facility. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=603.58s)]
*  Which has been destroyed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=608.9000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=610.38s)]
*  So, you know, even if you want, you can't really put it back on the table because it's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=611.38s)]
*  just not relevant. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=619.3800000000001s)]
*  So you need to somehow, you know, redraw the proposal. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=622.38s)]
*  And I think that at the moment I find it hard to believe that the U.S. will allow Iran in [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=629.38s)]
*  any deal to continue operating underground enrichment facilities, especially because [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=638.38s)]
*  the JCPOA did not allow that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=644.9s)]
*  And Trump is not going to agree to something that is worse from the JCPOA. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=650.02s)]
*  To be fair, the JCPOA did allow it over time once the restrictions came off. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=654.66s)]
*  But your points well taken, which is at this point, President Trump would, I think, would [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=659.14s)]
*  be hard pressed to agree to anything that looks like JCPOA in any way that gives enrichment [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=664.46s)]
*  facilities to Iran after they've rejected his generous offer. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=670.06s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force and Mossad have devastated his nuclear infrastructure, military command, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=675.54s)]
*  security officials. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=682.4599999999999s)]
*  This is his opportunity with now maximum leverage. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  But Barack, let me ask you this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=686.54s)]
*  By the way, I disagree with you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=687.54s)]
*  I think... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=689.3s)]
*  Good. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=690.3s)]
*  Disagree away. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=691.3s)]
*  No, no. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=692.3s)]
*  I think that I do not rule out at all that the basic principle of allowing Iran limited [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=693.3s)]
*  temporary enrichment. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=702.52s)]
*  I think this would still be in any proposal. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=704.78s)]
*  But I think what will be revised is the caps, meaning it will really become the symbolic [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=709.26s)]
*  thing and not something that could be practical in any way, meaning it will be something like [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=718.78s)]
*  allow you to retain 50 centrifuges and five kilograms of 3.67% low enriched uranium just [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=727.66s)]
*  in order for the Iranians to be able to say that they did not give up on the right. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=738.86s)]
*  So if you ask me, that's the scenario I'm seeing, something which is like very, very, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  very small enrichment operation and basically basically shutting down everything else. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=750.98s)]
*  Well, I think that would be insane, especially since the most Republicans in the Senate and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=762.54s)]
*  the House have said to President Trump and President Trump has said himself, as have [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=768.0600000000001s)]
*  many of these top advisors, zero enrichment, full dismantling. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=772.54s)]
*  That was before the Israeli Air Force and Mossad did such significant damage to Iran's [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=775.82s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure and command infrastructure. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=780.38s)]
*  But let me ask you about Fordow because you mentioned it and I think it's worth taking [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=783.5s)]
*  another look at that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=787.74s)]
*  I mean, Fordow heavily fortified under a mountain, goes hundreds of feet, has an enrichment facility. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=788.74s)]
*  Iran has started to install advanced centrifuges and that would give them a breakout capability, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=795.18s)]
*  the enriched material that they still probably have enough enriched material for 17 to 20 [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=800.9s)]
*  bombs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=806.58s)]
*  That, best of our knowledge, is still standing. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=807.7800000000001s)]
*  So it gives Iran that breakout. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=810.98s)]
*  But I think, Barack, what I want to talk about is because Fordow is so heavily fortified, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  it seems the Israelis have done significant damage to Iran's nuclear weapons program by [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=818.38s)]
*  killing at least 10 of the 12 high value targets, weapons scientists. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=823.26s)]
*  And that seems to me a significant blow. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=830.7800000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk to Nadav about that in the next half hour. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=832.7s)]
*  But what are your thoughts on that? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=835.6600000000001s)]
*  Where Iran's nuclear weapons program stands today, given the damage that's been done and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=836.98s)]
*  what is still left standing? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=842.26s)]
*  No, definitely significant damage. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=843.5799999999999s)]
*  But I don't think that, you know, I'm not trying to downplay the killing of the Iranian nuclear [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=847.18s)]
*  scientists. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  It's very significant, especially that those were the architects of the Iranian nuclear [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=858.8199999999999s)]
*  weapons program. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=865.5s)]
*  But as you know, in other, it's not exactly the same, but it has, it rhymes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=867.42s)]
*  You know, Israel assassinated over the years many terrorists. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=875.06s)]
*  Okay, usually, you know, it takes sometimes a few days, sometimes a few months, sometimes [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=879.5s)]
*  two years. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=887.14s)]
*  There's somebody else. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=888.14s)]
*  So it's what it did now is that it bought, in my opinion, you know, few months to think [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=890.3s)]
*  about, okay, what do we do going forward? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=899.66s)]
*  Because it's if the solution now will be that once a year we'll have to do it again. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=905.06s)]
*  I'm not sure that's the best solution. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=911.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=913.6999999999999s)]
*  What I think is needed right now is a serious discussion between Israel and the US about [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=915.3000000000001s)]
*  how and about an exit strategy so that we will not find ourselves in a Gaza scenario [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=924.38s)]
*  with Iran, because while we can get bogged down in Gaza, and it's a serious, serious [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=930.86s)]
*  problem and irritant, it's the country can still handle it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=937.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=942.22s)]
*  But if you get bogged down into the same Gaza scenario where you just don't know how to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=943.22s)]
*  reach a solution at the end, then it's something that I'm not sure Israel can handle. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=948.98s)]
*  So right now is the time to start this discussion about what's the exit strategy? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=954.34s)]
*  What do we want to have on the day after? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=959.5s)]
*  And we can't have the same thing as Gaza, as Nathaniel was saying, oh, the day after [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=963.7s)]
*  is after we destroy everything. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=968.6600000000001s)]
*  And then we will start discussing because we're not close to destroying everything. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=971.22s)]
*  Let's talk about the truth post that President Trump put out, because he's put out some interesting [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=977.0600000000001s)]
*  truth posts over recent weeks. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=982.9s)]
*  It seems to me from reporting that he was really leading a significant deception campaign [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=985.1600000000001s)]
*  coordinating with Netanyahu, the IDF coordinating with the US military, particularly CENTCOM, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  really lulling the Iranians into a false sense that they were safe and that Israel would not [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=998.58s)]
*  strike without a US green light. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1005.46s)]
*  And Israel literally caught and figuratively caught the Iranians asleep in their beds in [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1009.0600000000001s)]
*  the first night of strikes on Thursday, taking out some significant high value targets. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1015.0200000000001s)]
*  I guess a couple of questions. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1021.0200000000001s)]
*  Do you think President Trump was leading and part of this deception operation against Iran? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1023.62s)]
*  Second is, tell us a little bit from your sources, the debate inside the administration [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1030.54s)]
*  about this key question of actually using US forces to finally destroy the Hardin-Fordeaux [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1036.26s)]
*  facility using B-2 bombers and 30,000-pound massive ordnance penetrators. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1044.78s)]
*  What is going on inside the administration with respect to that debate? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1049.68s)]
*  So first, as far as I know, and I spoke about it with several White House officials, the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1054.4s)]
*  US or President Trump and the Trump administration were not part of an Israeli deception campaign. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  What I heard from at least three White House officials is that they told the Israelis [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1074.56s)]
*  several times during the days leading to the operation that they will not be part of it, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1079.76s)]
*  that they don't think it's the appropriate time to do it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1088.96s)]
*  Those messages were given both in private and in public. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1094.2s)]
*  But Barack, just to interrupt there for a second, isn't that exactly what they would [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1097.8799999999999s)]
*  tell you in order to have plausible deniability, in order to lay the predicate for potential [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1102.32s)]
*  negotiations in Oman? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1108.08s)]
*  That's what they would tell you? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  As part of a deception operation, they'd be looking to deceive you too as a reporter? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1112.56s)]
*  They would, but the only problem with that is that they said the same things in the days [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1117.3999999999999s)]
*  leading to the operation, to the leadership in Congress, the exact same thing. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1124.0s)]
*  They told both Senate Majority Leader Thun and other Senate and House leaders like Jeffries [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1132.52s)]
*  that they told the Israelis that they're against an attack in Iran in the current timing, that they're not going to get involved. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1149.64s)]
*  Wait a second, are you breaking a story here right now on the Iran breakdown that the Trump administration gave Netanyahu a red light, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1157.64s)]
*  do not attack, and Netanyahu defied that red light? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1165.0400000000002s)]
*  They did not tell Netanyahu do not attack. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1168.48s)]
*  They told Netanyahu, we do not think this is the right time to do it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  They did not tell him don't do it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1177.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1180.4399999999998s)]
*  Nobody told, or President Trump did not tell Netanyahu, I asked you not to do it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1181.72s)]
*  He told Netanyahu, I think it would be a mistake to do it now. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1188.52s)]
*  I will not be part of it, and I will not, I'm not supporting it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1192.12s)]
*  Okay, that's in the days before. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1197.36s)]
*  The day after Trump went on the bandwagon. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1200.2s)]
*  But that's why I'm telling you that the US was not part of any deception. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1205.72s)]
*  I'll tell you something more. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1210.76s)]
*  Okay, an hour before the bomb started falling in Tehran and other places in Iran, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1212.28s)]
*  the US government through official channels, okay, sent a diplomatic note to several of its allies in the region [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  and around the world. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1229.28s)]
*  Okay, an hour before, and I'm telling you this because a person that received this note called me immediately. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1230.72s)]
*  Okay, I was at my daughter's graduation party. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1236.48s)]
*  Okay, and somebody called me immediately and said the US government notified us that Israel is going to attack Iran on June 12. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1239.52s)]
*  The US is not involved. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1250.12s)]
*  President Trump wants peace. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1252.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what you would say to your Gulf allies. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1254.16s)]
*  If number one, you were part of a deception operation. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1256.96s)]
*  Number two, you wanted to make it clear to them because you know that they're going to make it clear to the Iranians [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1259.48s)]
*  that you weren't part of any kind of offensive operation, which is clear the United States was not. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1264.92s)]
*  There were no US pilots bombing Iranian infrastructure. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1269.64s)]
*  And you want to make sure that the Iranians understand there's still a diplomatic option. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1273.0800000000002s)]
*  But I think anyway, I mean, we can talk about and I'm sure history will write this. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1277.72s)]
*  You'll write this book one day. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1281.92s)]
*  Mark, I don't know. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1283.72s)]
*  I'm talking about myself. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1284.68s)]
*  I do not have one shred of evidence that says that the US was part of a deception campaign. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1286.12s)]
*  And I have a lot of evidence that it was not. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1294.04s)]
*  Okay, that's that's that's interesting. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1297.04s)]
*  It'll be interesting as history is written. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1300.84s)]
*  But in the last remaining minutes, Barack, I want you to focus on this. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1302.7199999999998s)]
*  What is the internal debate going on right now inside the administration, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  inside the Pentagon about whether the United States is prepared to finish the job in order, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1310.92s)]
*  you know, B-2 bombers, massive orange penetrators destroy the heavily fortified facility at Fordow, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1318.0800000000002s)]
*  take it out and end Iran's nuclear weapons program? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1326.68s)]
*  Because if it's left standing and President Trump is unable to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to this, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1329.72s)]
*  the Iranians will have a heavily fortified facility, 17 bombs worth of enriched material. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1336.08s)]
*  I'm sure surviving centrifuges and they can actually turn this into weapons grade uranium. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1341.8s)]
*  Now, whether they've got enough nuclear weapons scientists alive to actually fashion a crude nuclear device or a warhead is another question. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  What what what is the debate that's going on right now? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1354.12s)]
*  As I think we talked about it in the previous episode that we discussed this thing, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1356.84s)]
*  it's a one man decision at the end of the day. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1362.48s)]
*  What a very senior U.S. official told his Israeli counterpart after he gave him a formal request that the U.S. joins. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1368.0s)]
*  So the answer was, you know, we we passed on the request to President Trump. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1377.28s)]
*  He will make this decision. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1384.3200000000002s)]
*  I. I don't know what he's going to decide. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1388.2s)]
*  I think this is a the jury is still out. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1393.16s)]
*  I think the decision will have to be made pretty soon because from my understanding, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1398.56s)]
*  Trump wants this war to be over within days and he doesn't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  So if he wants this war to end and Iran not have a nuclear weapon, it means two things. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1414.92s)]
*  Either he can get a deal in a few days, which sounds to me not very likely, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1421.28s)]
*  or he'll take out Fordo in order to make sure that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1429.64s)]
*  Those are the two options that Trump will have to decide from his last true social post. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1436.52s)]
*  It seems that he's still not there, meaning he still, you know, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1443.56s)]
*  he still wants to try and pursue some sort of a deal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1449.52s)]
*  But those things can change within minutes, as we all know. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1453.36s)]
*  OK, well, Brock, listen, thank you so much for being on the show. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1457.56s)]
*  I want to wish you a happy Father's Day in these difficult times. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1460.2s)]
*  I hope your family and loved ones are safe in Israel and we look forward to great scoops and great reporting from you and Access. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1462.48s)]
*  So thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Brock. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1469.0s)]
*  The US side, Trump's team has stayed quiet, but they've positioned US military assets in the region. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1474.36s)]
*  The president needs to make this decision that Brock talk about either to get the Iranians back to Amman, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1482.12s)]
*  to negotiate the full dismantlement of their program or order the US military to launch B2 strikes against the heavily fortified Fordo facility. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1487.92s)]
*  Now, those Israeli strikes over the past couple of days have definitely given the president [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1498.48s)]
*  added negotiating leverage for these negotiations, but they've also are potentially forcing a military decision. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1502.52s)]
*  The message seems to me to Tehran. It's clear your skies are no longer safe. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1509.4s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force dominates them. They can come after anybody anytime, including Khamenei himself, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1514.24s)]
*  the supreme leader, as Khamenei has directly ordered ballistic missile strikes against Israeli civilians. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1520.96s)]
*  Israel cannot sustain that kind of civilian loss for much longer and Khamenei is truly playing with fire. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1527.0s)]
*  So let's turn to the Israeli front. We're going to introduce Nadav, who's done fantastic reporting for Yereed Aharonaut out of Israel. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1534.2s)]
*  Nadav, welcome to the Iran Breakdown. Glad to have you. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1541.52s)]
*  Hello, Nadav. Hi. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1551.4s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1553.0s)]
*  Good. I want to wish you, first of all, a happy Father's Day. I hope your family is safe. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1554.64s)]
*  I know it's difficult times in Israel. And I want to turn to the sort of Israeli front. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1560.96s)]
*  And you probably heard the last few minutes of Barack's comments, but certainly some real takeaways that Israel has really shaken the pillars of Iran's nuclear and military infrastructure. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1566.64s)]
*  And the United States has, I think, a choice. Leverage this moment or miss it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  So what are you seeing on the Israeli side and where do you think things are going to go from an Israeli decision-making point of view? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1581.84s)]
*  So the Israelis do not deny that this would end with a decision by the president either to sort of force Israel to end the war or join the war or at least be part of the final blow to the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1591.12s)]
*  And the Israelis are absolutely clear about this. As to Fodor, the question mark that you asked Barack, Israel doesn't have a good and effective way to actually tackle the challenge in Fodor in a short period of time. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  It can use its own air force and bombs to dig away into the mountain. It will be a slow process. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1625.4399999999998s)]
*  It will take time and it will be more than a few days to do so. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1632.04s)]
*  Israel already achieved, as you mentioned, tremendous military achievements. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1637.48s)]
*  It's flying over Iran right now as it is flying over Gaza or over Lebanon. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1642.16s)]
*  This is pretty amazing as of itself. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1649.32s)]
*  But the focus and keeping our eyes on the ball is not fighting an entire war against Iran. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1652.48s)]
*  Iran has many, many military targets. It's been an arch enemy of Israel for many years. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1659.64s)]
*  The IDF and the Israeli Air Force can spend at least six months just bombing away in Iran. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1664.44s)]
*  And I don't think that's the idea, because as you mentioned, it also is taking a heavy toll just this this night. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1669.64s)]
*  Ten Israelis who died, at least four that are unaccounted for. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1677.3200000000002s)]
*  And the kind of devastation that we have never seen in this country before, you know, in missiles in the first Gulf War or or Hamas or Hezbollah missiles. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1681.88s)]
*  This is a completely different story. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  So if the Americans decide to to do this and to join Israel in the final blow, that would be super important. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1693.76s)]
*  And then the Iranians are not going to say, OK, now we agree to negotiations. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1703.16s)]
*  Mark, you know, the Islamic Republic, probably better than I do. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1708.16s)]
*  It's never going to work that way. It's going to be sort of cessation of hostilities. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1711.8s)]
*  And then a few months of thinking of thinking within the Islamic Republic, higher echelons. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1718.08s)]
*  And then if everything goes well, they'll turn into the negotiation route. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1725.92s)]
*  It's all about and this was told, you know, is really generous. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1732.48s)]
*  We're saying that to me a year and a year and a half ago. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1735.52s)]
*  It's all about what's going to happen after we attack. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1738.56s)]
*  It's not about our attack. And by saying that, they meant the US. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1741.24s)]
*  It's either going to be carrots or sticks or both of those to make sure that the Islamic Republic doesn't turn to, for instance, breaking into a bomb. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1746.68s)]
*  They just announced today that they're stopping the reporting to the IAEA. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1755.52s)]
*  That's a major negative development. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1760.92s)]
*  If they keep up with this, they're signaling that they might break for a bomb. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1763.08s)]
*  And then should the US join? Will the US join? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1768.16s)]
*  So all eyes right now are in Washington and specifically on the White House and President Trump to make that decision. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1772.08s)]
*  But there are still stuff that Israel wants to do and is doing across Iran right now as we are speaking, mainly ballistic, but also nuclear. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1780.04s)]
*  And this is an ongoing effort. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  What are you hearing from your sources about Mossad's and the Israeli Air Force's killing of these top 10 nuclear weapons scientists? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1793.68s)]
*  I mean, when I when I think about this, I think about the movie Oppenheimer. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1804.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, if if Oppenheimer and his top 10 nuclear weapons scientists had been killed in, let's say, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1806.76s)]
*  February, March of 1945, right before the June Trinity test of the atomic weapon, that would have been a devastating blow to the Manhattan Project. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1814.4s)]
*  What what are your sources in Israel saying about that operation? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1825.4s)]
*  And if you could give us even some more detail and insight into it's a pretty extraordinary intelligence and military success. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1828.76s)]
*  What how did it happen? And what how significant is it? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1838.48s)]
*  So, first of all, most of the credit goes to Israel to Israel's intelligence branch this time and not the Mossad. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1843.56s)]
*  I know that the Mossad took a lot of headlines right after the attack began with those incredible stories. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1850.28s)]
*  I'm not downplaying those of Mossad agents flying drones within Iran, attacking air defenses in Iran. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  But this time, this was the work of the Israeli intelligence branch. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1864.8s)]
*  And they did a tremendous amount of work there. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1869.28s)]
*  You know, I can't share every detail that we have. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1873.56s)]
*  We are in a state of war here. I can say that this is the stuff of you know, this is really the stuff of movies, the kind of intelligence that Israel needed not only to hit these apartment buildings, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1877.04s)]
*  but to hit them in the right place, in the right angle, in the right room, sometimes trying not to hit other family members who are in the house, trying to differentiate between the rooms and the family members where you're not seeing them. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1890.2s)]
*  This is the kind of work that you need to do when you want to take out, as you said, the people responsible possibly for breaking to to a nuclear warhead. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1905.56s)]
*  Now, here's the thing, Mark. We didn't get all of them. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1918.0s)]
*  There are some names that I know of. I was looking for these names and they weren't there. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1923.0s)]
*  And that means that the IDF didn't get them. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1928.16s)]
*  And also, there's always a question of how much is it of an institutional kind of information and data and skill that was built over the years and how much is it really dependent on a specific person? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1931.24s)]
*  And the general assessment with the intelligence branch and the IDF is quite pessimistic. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1946.08s)]
*  They're saying, yes, this will pull them back. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1951.36s)]
*  It will definitely help. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1955.0s)]
*  But we don't think that this is more than together with the actual damage to their nuclear infrastructure. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1957.1999999999998s)]
*  We were thinking about this as between a year and a half, Mark, and more. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1967.4399999999998s)]
*  But the bare minimum is a year and a half. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  And if you are a decision maker in the Israeli cabinet and you hear that, you would say, OK, so I need to assume that this took them back a year and a half. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1976.72s)]
*  But it's not only about that. It's about drawing a line in the sand. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1985.04s)]
*  And I agree with my my colleague Barack said earlier. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1988.52s)]
*  The question is, what's going to happen now? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1992.2s)]
*  How do you make sure that they don't try to rebuild their abilities and you need to do this again because you wouldn't be able to do this again? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=1994.3600000000001s)]
*  And for that, you need the international community. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2002.88s)]
*  You need the United States. You need some type of an agreement or you need this regime go. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2005.72s)]
*  Now, the serious people I'm speaking with in Israel don't think that they can manufacture or engineer a regime change in Iran through aerial bombardments. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2012.0s)]
*  Basically, they do think that they can threaten the stability of the regime and forcing it to an extent to agree to an agreement knowing that they have too much to lose. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2023.8s)]
*  So and when they do this agreement, they'll have much less centrifuges, much less abilities, infrastructure, because that was hit by the Israelis. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2036.28s)]
*  And that's the idea. So this is a limited scope operation, at least until and if the US would decide to join it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2046.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm certainly I mean, setting back the nuclear weapons program for by a year and a half is is quite an accomplishment, particularly because the you were reporting on this or at least I saw this public reporting that Israeli intelligence had gotten evidence that Hamenei had now made a decision to actually greenlight the nuclear weaponization program. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2056.6s)]
*  And there's been a huge debate over 20 years in Washington, in Israel and European capitals that Hamenei himself had never made the decision to move forward on weaponization. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2075.88s)]
*  He had moved forward on other aspects of the nuclear weapons program. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2084.84s)]
*  But actually, on the warhead design, he hadn't actually given that green light. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  And that had been the position of the US intelligence community for for years. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2093.1600000000003s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what has come out publicly from the Israeli government and the intelligence community about Hamenei's decision to actually instruct these weapons scientists to move ahead with with this Iranian Manhattan project. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2096.96s)]
*  So I want to say what they they are saying and what they're not saying. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2111.0s)]
*  At no point did they say that Iran decided to break for a bomb. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2117.16s)]
*  OK, I want to be absolutely clear. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2120.96s)]
*  I don't want to mislead anyone. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2123.44s)]
*  It's not an argument that the Israelis are making. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2125.0s)]
*  But the argument that they were making is that decisions were made, probably, as you said, by the supreme leader, to start acquiring aggressively the abilities for the weapons group, which you only need in order to assemble a nuclear warhead or a nuclear bomb. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2127.4s)]
*  And the type of ingredients that the Iranians were either developing or trying to purchase around the world, you need them only for that. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2145.72s)]
*  And they were doing this aggressively. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  I was reporting this at the beginning of twenty twenty four based on a senior military official in Israel that said this is highly troubling. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2156.3599999999997s)]
*  And it was about at this point that the idea started really beginning drills towards a possible strike against Iran. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2165.7599999999998s)]
*  As months went by, two other things started developing. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2172.8s)]
*  The first one was this notion that was captured through documents and and other other data during the war that showed that the Iranians are actually serious about destroying the state of Israel, that they have a plan for the destruction of the state. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2177.48s)]
*  It's not just a slogan cried out in a mosque, a death to Israel, a death to America, but they have an actual plan. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2196.7599999999998s)]
*  It basically involves a joint attack against Israel. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2204.12s)]
*  They thought about this plan together with Hamas prior to the war. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2209.48s)]
*  Hamas was pitching parts of their plan to sort of compensate the parts of the Iranian plan. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2213.52s)]
*  But it's a serious thing. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2221.8799999999997s)]
*  So this wasn't a slogan ish kind of, you know, trying to do this for domestic consumption politically within Iran, within the Islamic Republic or to lead Muslim Ummah was about really destruction of Israel. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2223.72s)]
*  And Israel learned much about that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2237.3999999999996s)]
*  The second element is the one I already mentioned. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2239.3999999999996s)]
*  They started basically running towards the weapons group, something that they didn't do for many, many years with indications that were public, that the FDD published again and again, that they started playing with the idea that actually they need to cancel the famous fatwa by the Imam Khomeini and allow the development of nuclear weapons. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2242.76s)]
*  And this was sanctioned by the Supreme Leader. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2264.96s)]
*  Nothing like that could be done without the Supreme Leader. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2267.28s)]
*  And the third thing, which is interesting, is the ballistic missiles issue. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2269.8s)]
*  They discovered basically at the October attack against Israel in 2024 that, you know, there's a limit to what the arrow and the THAAD anti missile systems can do. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2273.88s)]
*  And considering the size of Israel, the population centers, etc., that this could be actually a soft spot, a weakness, the efficiency of the Israeli defense apparatus that they can use. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2287.6000000000004s)]
*  By the way, Mark, they still didn't use their bigger missiles, their bigger ballistic missile, which is our warheads of over one ton sometimes. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2299.8s)]
*  And if they use them, we see much more devastation in Israel. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2308.6000000000004s)]
*  And all of these three elements led the intelligence branch and the operation branch to go to the political level in Israel and say to the government, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2312.6s)]
*  look, we are entering an area in which we won't be able to tell you in a short while, which would be weeks, where are they headed? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2323.24s)]
*  Because the plan is so dispersed in terms of enrichment, it's going to be so dispersed in terms of the weapons group. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2333.44s)]
*  We're going to lose control. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2339.56s)]
*  Our intelligence grip over what's happening is going to weaken and it's going to weaken in a way that we simply will not be able to tell you exactly where they are. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2340.92s)]
*  And it's now your decision. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2354.8s)]
*  The recommendation was to strike knowing that Israel does not have the absolute capability to be effective in tackling the entire nuclear program. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2356.68s)]
*  So saying we're going to take the Iranian air defenses, we're going to take much of their surface to surface missile abilities. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2370.9199999999996s)]
*  We're going to take some of their ammunition. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2378.72s)]
*  We're going to take much of their nuclear installations. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2381.12s)]
*  We don't know how to do for do effectively enough. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2384.88s)]
*  We hope that the US would join the US knew about these plans. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2388.4s)]
*  This is the reason President Trump ordered non-essential diplomats out of the region beforehand. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  And Israel would have never done it if the US would have said, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it at this point, because we have the conversations in Oman on Sunday. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2400.12s)]
*  And in that regard, the Israelis feel certain that they didn't break any sort of I don't want to say even a red line, but any sort of line that was drawn in the sand by President Trump. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2413.52s)]
*  And according to the public statements made by the president right afterwards, and I would say the more than quite content that he has shown to this attack, I think it's very clear that there was a coordination here. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2427.12s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that the US committed to be part of the strike. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2441.12s)]
*  I don't think they committed. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2445.6s)]
*  Yeah, we probably heard my debate with Barack about whether President Trump was in on this deception operation that Israel was running against the Iranians that really caught them literally and figuratively in their beds. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2447.96s)]
*  I mean, my view is he was based on the signaling and the leaks to reporters that he wasn't in on a offensive operation against Iran. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2459.72s)]
*  There were no military, there were no US pilots, obviously operating in this, but he certainly knew about it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2472.72s)]
*  He didn't red light it. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2478.32s)]
*  He probably green light it because knowing your Prime Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu would not have gone forward without some kind of green light. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2480.88s)]
*  I kind of call it 50 shades of green. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2487.96s)]
*  There was some shade of green that I'm sure that President Trump provided to Netanyahu. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2490.08s)]
*  And then, as you said, he seemed very happy in that truth post on Thursday or Friday, really taking credit that this was US military equipment doing devastating damage to the Islamic Republic. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2495.96s)]
*  But talking about devastating damage, I want to focus a little bit in on this ballistic missile question because I saw some reporting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2510.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, our research has shown that Iran has probably three thousand ballistic missiles. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2518.4s)]
*  I know the official numbers are more like two thousand, but we've run the numbers. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2524.56s)]
*  Three thousand ballistic missiles, quite an inventory. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2528.6s)]
*  There was also reporting and I'm wondering if this is confirmed by your Israeli government sources that Iran had plans to quadruple. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2531.24s)]
*  At least eight, nine, ten, eleven thousand the number of ballistic missiles in a few years and take it up to twenty thousand within six years. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2540.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that would have given them devastating capabilities where they wouldn't even have to use nuclear weapons to destroy central Israel. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2548.92s)]
*  They could relentlessly fire ballistic missiles in the hundreds at the state of Israel and do massive damage. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2555.92s)]
*  Is that consistent with what you've been reporting or what you've heard? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2562.52s)]
*  And yeah, it's absolutely. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2566.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolutely. That's the that's the second ingredient that I mentioned in my previous answer. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2569.4s)]
*  And I would specifically as to coordination with Israel. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2575.08s)]
*  Look, I never bet against America and I never bet against the Barack in Washington, D.C. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2578.92s)]
*  OK, he's he's just a fantastic reporter. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2585.0s)]
*  I can only talk about what my reporting has shown. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2588.96s)]
*  I'll just give you two examples. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2592.6000000000004s)]
*  One example is that I remember myself at least twice in recent months calling good sources that I have within the Israeli government asking about the tense conversation between President Trump. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2594.6s)]
*  Or at least this is how it was described by one or two media outlets in Israel, in Israel. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2607.2s)]
*  And I the response I would get from my sources is what was described in the media is untrue. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2613.84s)]
*  And that is not the description of the conversation was that actually a great conversation specifically on Iran. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2621.48s)]
*  And I would say, hey, but I've heard otherwise from my some of my Israeli colleagues here. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2627.48s)]
*  And they would say, we know you did. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2633.44s)]
*  And there is a reason to that. And so I don't know if that deception was also towards journalists. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2635.72s)]
*  I don't want to say I do want to say and you don't need sources for that. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2641.92s)]
*  You just need to Google Steve Wittkopf's speech in a fundraiser on Wednesday night in New York. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it was a Hatzala fundraiser. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2654.3199999999997s)]
*  And I would advise anyone who wants to understand how coordinated the US was just to listen to Steve Wittkopf's speech. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2657.6s)]
*  I see Wittkopf is probably the closest person in the world in terms of international relations to the president. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2665.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it would be fair to say. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2673.36s)]
*  And what Wittkopf said there, I found quite amazing. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2675.44s)]
*  It was not only that the enrichment of uranium in Iran is a risk to Israel's existence and a risk to the US security and the world's security, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2679.6s)]
*  but also ballistic missile program is a risk to Israel's existence. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2689.44s)]
*  Something that, by the way, the Israelis didn't really say before that. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2696.04s)]
*  Now they're saying it today. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2700.8s)]
*  Netanyahu is talking about this today. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2702.1200000000003s)]
*  He went to Batyam to the place in which an Iranian ballistic missile landed and destroyed several apartment buildings. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2704.36s)]
*  And he said, just imagine that they would have had twenty thousand. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2712.88s)]
*  But Steve Wittkopf said that beforehand. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2716.5600000000004s)]
*  And he said that in New York on the record, it's on Twitter. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2719.36s)]
*  I saw that that night. It's not after the fact, after the attack. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2723.36s)]
*  And I was marking this. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  So I was doing it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2728.32s)]
*  It was a mental note by him positioning himself there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2729.32s)]
*  It was absolutely clear that the administration understands the worries of Israel, but more so that it understands that any operation against Iran is not only focused on nuclear enrichment. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2734.44s)]
*  It's also focused on their ballistic abilities, very in line with what Israel thought about this ballistic program. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2749.6s)]
*  By the way, you know, supervising, trying to prevent a nuclear program is difficult. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2759.6s)]
*  Trying to do so with ballistic missiles is almost impossible. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2767.3199999999997s)]
*  It's almost impossible because you can import those. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2773.16s)]
*  You can manufacture them. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2776.72s)]
*  They have no trace on like uranium and rich uranium. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2778.6000000000004s)]
*  You don't have an international agency or a treaty to prevent countries from developing these kind of ballistic missiles. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  These are not intercontinent ballistic missiles. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2789.0s)]
*  It's extremely difficult. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2792.6400000000003s)]
*  So that's that's another aim that's very ambitious. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2794.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there is actually an international missile control body and agreements that have been reached with multiple countries that limit the range and payload of the missile. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2797.36s)]
*  And I think one of the criticisms of the JCPOA, which I made back in 2015, others made as well, is that agreement was not only fatally flawed on the nuclear side, but it didn't cover ballistic missiles, including ballistic missiles that were capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2808.96s)]
*  So it sounds like Israel has done significant damage both to the nuclear program and is working at trying to limit and degrade the Iranian ballistic missile inventory and ballistic missile production capability. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2823.44s)]
*  We'll see how how well that goes. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  What's your sense of how much time is left? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2838.88s)]
*  I mean, what what are Israeli officials saying with respect to the way forward? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2841.4s)]
*  Is this is it literally days or is it potentially weeks? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2845.7999999999997s)]
*  It's potentially weeks. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2850.64s)]
*  I'm not sure that Israel has weeks. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2852.52s)]
*  This also goes again to President Trump and whatever the decision the decision that he'll make. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2855.6s)]
*  Sorry, this is what you just heard is the kind of stuff that you hear. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2864.16s)]
*  OK, so basically what the what the idea is is saying is don't go into the shelter now, but you might need to go to the shelter in the next few months. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2871.0s)]
*  That's that's the sound that you just heard. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2880.92s)]
*  So so basically the idea is telling me, you know, a few days at least a few days at least to reach our initial aims and my guess mark. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2883.6s)]
*  And I'm guessing right now I'm speculating that they have a plan for Purdue. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  They have a contingency if the US says no. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2901.7999999999997s)]
*  Now, I'm not sure that it is as effective, but I'm deaf. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2905.2s)]
*  You know, my speculation, knowing the idea is that they have a contingency there and. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2911.64s)]
*  Israel is also ready or is sort of making itself ready to the possibility that the Iranians won't want to stop at a certain point. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2919.68s)]
*  And now that's dangerous. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2928.28s)]
*  That's dangerous because you don't want to have another Ukraine, Russia in the Middle East. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2929.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's a very kind of the Iraq-Iran war lasted for for eight years. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2935.2400000000002s)]
*  As you know better than me, it only stopped after Khomeini decided that it is crucial for the survival of the regime and the Republic to stop the war. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2940.44s)]
*  And he drank the cup of poison to quote the expression he used. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2951.96s)]
*  The Israelis are quoting to me this expression. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2956.88s)]
*  They are quoting to me this. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2960.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's very important because I think this is highly irrelevant, highly relevant to today. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2961.84s)]
*  The reason that Khomeini drank the poison chalice is because well, actually Khomeini drank the poison chalice is because Khomeini went to Khomeini with former president Rafsanjani and said to Khomeini. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2967.56s)]
*  We have to end this war because the United States just shot down a passenger airline. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2981.72s)]
*  They're claiming they did it by mistake. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2987.68s)]
*  We know as Americans, they did it on purpose. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2989.8s)]
*  This means the United States is about to intervene in the war. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2993.04s)]
*  We can fight Iraq and Saddam. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2996.08s)]
*  We cannot fight the United States of America because that is potentially regime ending. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=2998.08s)]
*  And Khomeini after that bitter war and over a million lives lost made that decision to end the war because he believed the United States was going to intervene. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3003.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it actually underscores what the Israeli officials are saying, what many of the United States are saying, which is if President Trump wants to end this war, the credible threats of military intervention is indispensable to that. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3012.04s)]
*  Khomeini needs to understand President Trump is serious about unleashing B-2 bombers and 30,000 pound massive ordnance penetrators to take down Fordow, but also may not stop there, may join the Israelis in going after leadership assets. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3028.9599999999996s)]
*  And I guess I know you probably may have to run to a shelter soon. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3044.0s)]
*  I want to ask maybe a final question on that, Nadav. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3048.56s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that if Khomeini decides to continue to escalate that Israeli political leaders will decide to go after Khomeini himself? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3051.6s)]
*  I think we may have lost Eyal. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3065.92s)]
*  The Wi-Fi may have frozen. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3070.48s)]
*  So I think with that, we will end the interview. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3072.16s)]
*  Hopefully Eyal is safe in the bunker. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3075.0s)]
*  And I want to thank Nadav, Eyal and Barak or Eyal very much for joining us. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3079.88s)]
*  We're going to be watching certainly for further signs of Israeli strikes. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3086.0s)]
*  What are Trump administration red lines at the negotiating table? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3090.04s)]
*  What would trigger a US response? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3093.52s)]
*  And also something that we haven't talked a lot about on this live podcast, but we certainly have talked about on many others. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3095.76s)]
*  What are the escalation scenarios from Hezbollah, the Houthis, other Iranian terror proxies? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3103.4s)]
*  I'm also very concerned about attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad or in the United States. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3109.44s)]
*  So obviously we'll be looking for that and discussing that in greater detail. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3115.48s)]
*  It's going to be more updates to come here on the Iran breakdown. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3120.1200000000003s)]
*  Please look out for season two. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3122.92s)]
*  We're going to be dropping it later this summer. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3124.56s)]
*  Had an overwhelming response from our listeners and our viewers. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3126.52s)]
*  We're top three percent of podcasts, which I think is really confirms that 2025, as I expected, was going to be the Iran year. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3130.52s)]
*  And we've had some wonderful guests who've obviously attracted a lot of interest and support. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3138.6800000000003s)]
*  So for deeper analysis, please stay plugged in all of these work across our policy, military and regional coverage. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3143.28s)]
*  And until next time, please stay alert, stay informed and join me when we break it down all over again. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyoGsvpl3c&t=3151.04s)]
