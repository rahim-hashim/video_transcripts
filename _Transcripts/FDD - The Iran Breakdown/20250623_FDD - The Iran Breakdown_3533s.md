Video Description: The shadow war is over. This weekend, the United States took direct military action against Iran’s nuclear program for the first time, in a coordinated operation with Israel that targeted the regime’s most heavily fortified enrichment sites.
The strikes were historic. The question now: Did they actually work? What was hit — and is anything still operational?
Host Mark Dubowitz is joined by David Albright — president and founder of the Institute for Science and International Security and one of the world’s leading nuclear experts — to break down the damage, the regime’s next moves, and what comes after Operation Midnight Hammer.

# THE IRAN BREAKDOWN | Assessing the U.S. Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Facilities
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8)
*  They're working on the delivery system not just to hit Israel or Europe, they want to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  hit continental United States. Can't allow that to happen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=9.52s)]
*  The Islamic Republic means what it says when it says death to Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Eventually we will attack Iran's nuclear facility because there's no other choice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Israel cannot allow Iran to go nuclear. Israel is committed to defend ourselves by ourselves [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=20.12s)]
*  and we will do whatever it takes with whatever we have so that Iran does not become a nuclear [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=24.36s)]
*  power. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=28.68s)]
*  This is the Iran Breakdown. So let's break it down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=29.5s)]
*  David Albright, wonderful to have you here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=37.58s)]
*  It's good to be here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=39.54s)]
*  David, you're a physicist, you're a weapons inspector, you've been doing this for decades. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=41.1s)]
*  I've known you for 20 years. I can't believe we've been working on the Iran issue for that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  long so I want to welcome you to the Iran Breakdown. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  David, let's break it down. I think everybody out there, the real question is not the success [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=51.82s)]
*  of the strikes but also the concerns about what's left. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=59.3s)]
*  But before we get into that, I want to talk a little bit about your background because [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=62.86s)]
*  you've been working on these issues for many, many years and you were one of the few experts [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=65.86s)]
*  around the time of the Iraq War who was deeply skeptical that Saddam actually had a nuclear [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=71.26s)]
*  weapons program. Tell us a little bit about that and then also about your work on Iran [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=76.06s)]
*  and maybe the difference between what you found back in the early 2000s and what you've [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=80.7s)]
*  seen with respect to Iran's nuclear weapons program since. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=84.94s)]
*  It does go quite a bit back in time. It goes to the late summer, early fall of 2002 and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=88.18s)]
*  we had information that the evidence of the Bush administration which centered on aluminum [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=97.66000000000001s)]
*  tubes was not any good. I first heard about it from an IA, International Atomic Energy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=103.9s)]
*  Agency colleague in 2001 who basically said that the evidence was being spun up. We were [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  a different kind of organization so it was hard for us to get our message out. But essentially, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=120.78s)]
*  I went and talked to various centrifuge experts because the whole claim was the aluminum tubes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=127.14000000000001s)]
*  would be made into centrifuges that then would spin and give Saddam the ability to rapidly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  make weapon-grade uranium. The CIA called it the Zippa-type centrifuge. I went to Gerdon [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=138.3s)]
*  Zippa who I know. He was one of the founders of the whole centrifuge operation and he said [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  this is ridiculous. We had a close colleague who consulted with Oak Ridge who said that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=150.94s)]
*  it's just not true. I tried to get that across but we learned that we need to be more effective [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=156.9s)]
*  because the real trouble was it wasn't that no one knew. It was that the voices that did [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=163.9s)]
*  were suppressed. It really is an issue of getting your voice heard. Now while that's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=170.9s)]
*  going on, the Iranian opposition group and the CRI said there's a nuclear site near [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=177.94s)]
*  Natanz and also Iraq in Iran. We could quickly find this site near Iraq. It was a heavy water [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=183.94s)]
*  production plant. It took some work to find the site near Natanz and the opposition group [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=190.94s)]
*  had said it's a fuel fabrication plant. So I had to use our sources and methods to find that it was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=197.94s)]
*  actually a gas centrifuge plant and we've been able to find it. We've been able to find it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=204.94s)]
*  We've been looking for that plant for a couple years. What I did is I teamed up with CNN [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=211.94s)]
*  and they confirmed the finding that it was a centrifuge plant and then they did a spot featuring [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=219.94s)]
*  our work in December 2002. Interestingly Zarif was the one brought on as Iran's ambassador. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=225.94s)]
*  So this is Jabhat Zarif who was former Iranian foreign minister but before that was the ambassador [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=232.94s)]
*  to the United Nations who negotiated the 2015 deal with Obama. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=237.94s)]
*  That's right. He was sort of brought on to deny it all but not completely. But it actually [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=241.94s)]
*  helped the International Atomic Energy Agency which had stalled out. Iran, they knew about this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=248.94s)]
*  They were approaching Iran, let us in, let us in. Iran said okay, next month, next month. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=254.94s)]
*  And we decided to go public because it just got ridiculous and the IAEA director general's office [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=260.94s)]
*  was nervous at first. But after the story appeared they called me and thanked me. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=267.94s)]
*  So it helped. And what it did is it forced Iran to admit to having this enrichment program. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=272.94s)]
*  So it's not a, this is like if Iran had this massive secret enrichment plant, the IAEA continued to work [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=278.94s)]
*  and led by Ali Hynonen who you know well, and they found one secret site after another. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=286.94s)]
*  Some were missed. There was a, you know, Iran was playing the old game of we're caught so why don't we admit [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=292.94s)]
*  90% and hide 10% and what the 10% they were hiding was their nuclear weapons program. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=301.94s)]
*  So for example the Fordow enrichment site which was part of the nuclear weapons program, they hid. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=307.94s)]
*  And we didn't know about that. We just knew about Natanz and it was the same with the International Atomic Energy Agency [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=313.94s)]
*  and U.S. intelligence. So in the telling the truth they were also lying. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=319.94s)]
*  But it was a massive, massive secret nuclear program and there were major undeclared activities and materials [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=326.94s)]
*  that led to a UN Security Council resolution in 2005 or so that they violated their safeguards agreement. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=334.94s)]
*  So you were deeply skeptical that Saddam had a nuclear weapons program. No one listened. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=342.94s)]
*  But you became increasingly concerned about Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=346.94s)]
*  And no one listened. We couldn't get the Bush administration to pivot. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=351.94s)]
*  I mean the most we could get out of them and it was David Ensor at CNN was a comment sort of well after we deal with [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=355.94s)]
*  Baghdad we'll deal with Tehran. And they were slow to the game to really try to find ways to confront what Iran was doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=363.94s)]
*  So fast forward today. I mean you mentioned what we knew, what we didn't know. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=374.94s)]
*  And I think that's on everybody's mind is what do we know and what do we not know in the wake of these strikes by the United States [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=378.94s)]
*  and Israel against Iran's nuclear program. So I want to jump right into that and then we can provide some more history [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=384.94s)]
*  and more context as we talk about the various sites. But you mentioned Iraq, you mentioned the Tans, you mentioned Fordow, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=390.94s)]
*  three major sites that were targeted by Israel and the United States. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=395.94s)]
*  The question that is on many people's minds is that's great. Looks like an operation of real incredible tactical brilliance. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=399.94s)]
*  But if we lost strategically, in other words, are there is there hidden material, hidden centrifuges, hidden capabilities, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=406.94s)]
*  nuclear weapons scientists who have not been taken out by the Israelis and all that Iran has to do is wait and work covertly at developing a nuclear weapon [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=413.94s)]
*  somewhere in some bunker in some tunnel that we don't know about or that the United States and Israel haven't targeted. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=424.94s)]
*  How worried are you about that? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=430.94s)]
*  I'm not that worried. I mean, I think you have to be realistic about what you're trying to accomplish and you have to be systematic. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=432.94s)]
*  What has been accomplished is to pretty much destroy the Natanz underground site, the pilot site. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=443.94s)]
*  That's you're talking 15,000 centrifuges, most of which are advanced centrifuges. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=451.94s)]
*  And just understand, because I want to go site by site, because we're going to go really technical on this Iran breakdown episode [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=458.94s)]
*  because I think there's too much discussion in five minutes sound bites on major media and not enough opportunity to go deep with the one of the most foremost technical experts. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=464.94s)]
*  So talk about Natanz. What was at Natanz before the strikes and what's your assessment of what's left standing? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=474.94s)]
*  Well, Natanz was the workhorse of the enrichment program. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=481.94s)]
*  It's where they would make the five up to five percent enriched uranium. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=484.94s)]
*  And it has about 15,000 centrifuges. So it can make quite a bit. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=487.94s)]
*  But if you're going to make weapon grade uranium, which appears to have been Iran's intent, which I can explain a little later. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=492.94s)]
*  But 70 percent of that effort has to take place at Natanz. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=501.94s)]
*  And so if you knock that out, you've knocked out a great amount of their capability to make weapon grade uranium. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=505.94s)]
*  And David, why? Why does 70 percent of that effort have to take place in Natanz rather than at Fordow or some other facility with a small number of advanced centrifuges enriched material that they can then take to weapons grade? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=512.94s)]
*  Why is Natanz so important to the Iranian nuclear weapons program? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=524.94s)]
*  When you're enriching, it's not a linear process. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=527.94s)]
*  I mean, you have to spend a lot more effort to go from, let's say, natural point seven percent to concentrate that up to four and a half percent. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=530.94s)]
*  It just takes more takes more work. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=539.94s)]
*  And so the as you but if you wanted to go from, let's say, 60 to 90, you only need about one percent. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=542.94s)]
*  So it's 99 percent of the way there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=549.94s)]
*  So even though it looks like a big gap, 60 to 90 in terms of the enriching, increasing the concentration of the in the isotope that's desired as uranium, 235, it's not much effort at all. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=551.94s)]
*  And so Fordow becomes important as it was originally designed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=564.94s)]
*  It was designed to make weapon grade uranium. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=569.94s)]
*  It was called the Al Ghadir project under the Ahmad Plan. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=572.94s)]
*  And it was going to get its five percent enriched uranium for Natanz. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=575.94s)]
*  There was a formal document between the Ahmad Plan people and the Atomic Energy Organization to provide the five percent enriched uranium. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=579.94s)]
*  And then in this much smaller facility that has no more than three thousand centrifuges, they would take the five percent and turn it into 90. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=588.94s)]
*  OK, so just to look back just for our viewers to understand. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=598.94s)]
*  So you've got yellow cake, which you mine and you turn that into uranium hexafluoride. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=601.94s)]
*  That conversion takes place at a facility called Isfahan, which we can talk about through a conversion facility. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=607.94s)]
*  Correct. You take that uranium gas and then you move it to Natanz. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=612.94s)]
*  You then enrich that to three point six, seven percent or whatever it is, four and a half percent. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=617.94s)]
*  It's been four and a half, four and a half percent. Right. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=623.94s)]
*  And that's the workhorse. So that's generating large quantities of four, four and a half percent enriched uranium. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=625.94s)]
*  You take that stockpile and then you move that to Fordow or or that's right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=632.94s)]
*  And some of it was moved to the pilot plant to make 20 percent and the pilot plant at Natanz at Natanz. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=637.94s)]
*  Right. Also 60 percent. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=643.94s)]
*  It one of the for a couple of years it was Ron was making the 60 percent at a fairly slow rate. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=646.94s)]
*  But last December, it decided to take its 20 percent stock and enrich most of it to 60 percent. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=654.94s)]
*  So it went from several kilograms or so a month to over 35 kilograms a month. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=660.94s)]
*  And that's done in times that was done at Fordow. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=667.94s)]
*  OK, so that's the workhorse that takes the four percent. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=670.94s)]
*  Make it four percent makes the four percent. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=674.94s)]
*  It also has a facility that can make the 20 percent. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=677.94s)]
*  It then takes that stockpile, goes to Fordow, takes that 20 percent to 60. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=680.94s)]
*  And Fordow is also where they'll take it to 90, which is weapons grade uranium. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=684.94s)]
*  So you're saying that with Israel, the United States destroying the Natanz facility, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=688.94s)]
*  and it sounds like even the IAEA has confirmed that that the facility both above ground and below ground has been destroyed. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=692.94s)]
*  They've essentially destroyed the workhorse of the nuclear program that you need for four percent and for 20 percent. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=699.94s)]
*  Yeah. And the 20 percent was also being made at Fordow. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=707.94s)]
*  So but but the point is, is that the number of centrifuges you need to go from five to 20 and then onward is a lot fewer than what you need to make the five percent. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=711.94s)]
*  And again, some of this Natanz was supposed to be a civil facility, only making four and a half percent, three and a half percent to be then sent back to Esfahan to be converted into uranium oxide to go into reactor fuel. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=723.94s)]
*  And one of the signals that something is really amiss is Iran didn't do that in the last two, three years. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=737.94s)]
*  It was producing four and a half percent. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=744.94s)]
*  It was then converting it into 20 percent. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=748.94s)]
*  And then and then in the last six months or so, really accelerating its conversion of that enrichment of that material to 60 percent. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=751.94s)]
*  So it was all screwy. And that's not a peaceful program. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=758.94s)]
*  I mean, there's no need to to go to 20 percent at that amount, let alone 60 percent. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=762.94s)]
*  So in a sense, we characterized it at my institute as like a slow motion breakout that they wanted to get into a position to be able to make a considerable amount of weapon grade uranium in as short of time as possible in the least number of centrifuges. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=768.94s)]
*  And before the bombing, they reached a point where they would have been able to use just maybe five, let's say, thousand that thousand centrifuges, maybe 1700, the ones that all the advanced centrifuges afford out and be able to make enough for a bomb in a few days and enough for nine in within a month. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=783.94s)]
*  And so that capability is now gone. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=797.94s)]
*  So that capability has been destroyed. Now, I know a lot of folks have been concerned. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=801.94s)]
*  There have been satellite images a few days before the initial Israeli bombing of Natanz that trucks pulled up at the Natanz facility. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=804.94s)]
*  And the assumption is that material and equipment was taken out. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=813.94s)]
*  Are you do you assume that the material was taken out? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=817.94s)]
*  And if so, isn't it possible that Iran pulls out the centrifuges, takes the enriched material and then diverts it to some clandestine site where they built another enrichment facility under a mountain in a tunnel? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=821.94s)]
*  And from there, they can use the centrifuges and the enriched material to make the most of the material. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=833.94s)]
*  Yeah, and that's and that's the worst case. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=837.94s)]
*  I mean, in terms of what the trucks took out, we don't know. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=840.94s)]
*  I mean, we assume they've been moving the stocks. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=844.94s)]
*  The 60 percent were both at Esfahan and at Fordow and a little bit at the pilot point. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=847.94s)]
*  So I think that's the worst case. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=852.94s)]
*  And I think that's the worst case. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=855.94s)]
*  And we believe the I believe the Esfahan, the material, Esfahan and Fordow was probably moved early on. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=859.94s)]
*  And and that these bombings have been trying to destroy infrastructure. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=867.94s)]
*  And we and we have to keep this in sort of an environment where we have to keep the infrastructure in place. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=871.94s)]
*  And I think that's the worst case scenario. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=877.94s)]
*  And and that these bombings have been trying to destroy infrastructure. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=881.94s)]
*  And we and we have to keep this in sort of in a structured or think about in a structured way. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=885.94s)]
*  You want to you want to make the main sites inoperative. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=891.94s)]
*  You want to do permanent damage to parts of them that are bottlenecks for reconstitution. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=896.94s)]
*  And then you have to deal with the stocks. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=903.94s)]
*  I mean, Israel could have gotten lucky and when it bombed Esfahan the first time, maybe it could have destroyed a lot of them at one point a couple of years ago when the IE was still reporting on the quantities. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=905.94s)]
*  Eighty five percent of the 20 percent and 60 percent was in one building at Esfahan. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=916.94s)]
*  And that building was targeted by Israel in the first first attack of Esfahan. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=921.94s)]
*  But I would assume they moved it out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=927.94s)]
*  Let's talk about Esfahan, David. So we have a sense of Natanz is destroyed. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=929.94s)]
*  Esfahan has been a very important facility, didn't get a lot of attention in the media in the initial days. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=933.94s)]
*  But explain to us what is at Esfahan. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=938.94s)]
*  Our understanding is that there's two conversion facilities, but also there's, as you said, there's stockpile of enriched material that is likely buried in tunnels. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=940.94s)]
*  There's also been recent reports. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=950.94s)]
*  I think it was Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, who said just recently about a potential third enrichment facility sitting in Esfahan. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=952.94s)]
*  That came as quite a shock to me because I never assumed there was another enrichment facility sitting at Esfahan. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=962.94s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't either. And Esfahan historically was one of the first on declare questionable activities of Iran. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=969.94s)]
*  But it was they were buying uranium conversion capabilities to go from natural uranium to uranium hexafluoride. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=978.94s)]
*  And they were getting help from China. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=985.94s)]
*  They were in the process getting a lot of undeclared uranium of various types. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=987.94s)]
*  And it's taken a long time to make that main conversion facility. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=993.94s)]
*  And most of the enriched uranium, or much of the enriched uranium, most of it that we've seen produced at Natanz and Fordow, depended on uranium hexafluoride from the uranium conversion. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=998.94s)]
*  OK, so that's gone. There's another facility. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1011.94s)]
*  And then Iran was adding things to the site, fuel fabrication capabilities, making fuel for the Tehran research reactor. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1014.94s)]
*  It added metal lines so it could make enriched uranium metal. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1023.94s)]
*  Talk about the metal because that's obviously a very it's a key bottleneck for a nuclear weapons program. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1027.94s)]
*  Yeah, and that's right. And so it was part of the Imaad plan. And they had finished a pilot plan. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1031.94s)]
*  So the Imaad plan was a plan for a structured nuclear weapon. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1036.94s)]
*  Well, I don't use the word structured. I think it was just a crash nuclear weapons program. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1039.94s)]
*  And the reason I don't use it is because then what came next? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1044.94s)]
*  And it creates this false dichotomy, which I think partly lies at the heart of the failure of the U.S. intelligence community to properly assess Iran, which is it looks at a mod is what Iran would restart. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1048.94s)]
*  It wouldn't restart a unstructured nuclear weapons program. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1064.94s)]
*  It wouldn't have a non-structured nuclear weapons program post Imaad. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1067.94s)]
*  So Imaad was a well thought through crash nuclear weapons program to make five nuclear weapons, four delivered by missiles. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1071.94s)]
*  But it got scared and it shut it down. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1080.94s)]
*  But also at that point, it wasn't able to make weapon grade uranium. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1083.94s)]
*  They got scared after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1086.94s)]
*  And so they and they also had no source of weapon grade uranium. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1090.94s)]
*  And the IAEA was really pressing them on and finding secret sites. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1094.94s)]
*  And I think they were scared that the IAEA was soon to find the secret sites associated with the Imaad plan. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1098.94s)]
*  And they knew they could go, in a sense, go in a more reduced way, more covert and deal with the bottlenecks. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1105.94s)]
*  The principal one was producing weapon grade uranium. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1114.94s)]
*  And now they've managed, ironically, at the same site, Al Ghadir. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1118.94s)]
*  They now, until recently, developed the capability to actually start with natural uranium and then make weapon grade uranium at Fordow. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1123.94s)]
*  But they could accelerate the process by running 60 percent through to get them a jump start on the amount of weapon grade uranium they had. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1132.94s)]
*  So it started as a nuclear weapons production site. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1140.94s)]
*  It sure looked like one by the before this bombing attack started. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1143.94s)]
*  OK, so jump back into Isfahan. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1149.94s)]
*  So we have this facility that takes yellow cake into uranium hexafluoride that gets pumped into centrifuges and then enriched to higher levels. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1151.94s)]
*  But we also have this conversion facility that takes weapons grade, 90 percent enriched uranium, turns it into uranium metal. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1158.94s)]
*  And you need uranium metal for a nuclear warhead. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1167.94s)]
*  Do you need that also for a crude nuclear device? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1170.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1172.94s)]
*  You can do it otherwise, but it's extremely difficult. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1174.94s)]
*  And I don't think it's ever really been done in practice. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1177.94s)]
*  So isn't that a critical bottleneck and node in the nuclear weapons program? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1179.94s)]
*  It is. And I should have probably finished. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1183.94s)]
*  I got diverted. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1186.94s)]
*  But so Iran knew how to make, learned how to make metal, but it had never made it out of uranium when they shut down Amman. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1188.94s)]
*  And and later the Atomic Energy Organization creates facilities at Isfahan to make enriched uranium metal and then tested it a couple of years ago and then stopped. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1196.94s)]
*  But it was it was it alarmed the kind of the international community that cares about this, the Europeans, the United States, Japan, that why would Iran have a capability to make enriched uranium metal? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1206.94s)]
*  And they and they tried to concoct some reason, but it made no no real sense. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1219.94s)]
*  And so it was one of the first sites taken out by Israel. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1224.94s)]
*  The first tech went after that, that that metal enriched uranium metal conversion facility. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1228.94s)]
*  Now, we don't know for sure what happened to the equipment that was in the pilot plant was called Shahi Maladi. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1234.94s)]
*  And where is that? Is that was that rolled into the Atomic Energy Organization? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1242.94s)]
*  We know the military centrifuge program run under Amman was run into the Atomic Energy Organization. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1249.94s)]
*  The IAEA was able to establish that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1256.94s)]
*  And so do they this is their other equipment that didn't get rolled in and has been in storage and and it could have been stored at this facility, Turqas Abad, which had all these shipping containers of old Amman plant equipment and material. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1259.94s)]
*  So so there is an uncertainty. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1275.94s)]
*  But knocking out the facility at Esfahan to first order creates a bottleneck. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1278.94s)]
*  And and so you and that's the first things you have to do is destroy the infrastructure that is critical to making a nuclear weapon. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1284.94s)]
*  And some of it is really can be quite brutal. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1291.94s)]
*  They something we would never do. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1295.94s)]
*  They decided that one bottle potential bottleneck they want to create is in the intellectual capital. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1299.94s)]
*  So they wanted to wipe out kind of a weapon here as elite and and make it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1305.94s)]
*  They know Israel's well aware that people can be replaced. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1311.94s)]
*  But in the short term, it's extremely disruptive. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1314.94s)]
*  And that's why I think I would never see this as what's going on as a strategic mistake. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1319.94s)]
*  If I could just jump back to that for a bit is that the. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1323.94s)]
*  You had a program on the verge of being able to make weapon grade uranium in days, make the bomb in a matter of months. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1328.94s)]
*  And it's crude in a sense, in a sense, it's not missile deliverable. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1336.94s)]
*  It's actually quite a sophisticated design combining elements of technology from the fifties and elements from the seventies. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1340.94s)]
*  And so it's half a meter across and and and has had good Soviet nuclear weapons technology implanted in some of it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1348.94s)]
*  So so I think it's it's I would not call it a crude device, but it may not be ready to be put on a ballistic missile. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1359.94s)]
*  And now we've gone to a point where they're going to they're going to have to do things in the garage or in tunnels or whatever to try to make any weapon grade uranium. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1367.94s)]
*  And not in the short term, probably. And there and their ability to make the bomb itself has been set back, I think, by several months. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1377.94s)]
*  So we were thinking, you know, assessing maybe they need six months to make this device in a reliable manner. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1386.94s)]
*  Some thought it was shorter. But now we think it's it's longer. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1394.94s)]
*  It's not it's not two years longer, but it's it's months longer. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1398.94s)]
*  And that period of time is probably growing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1402.94s)]
*  So I think so I would say that this has been a very it's been successful. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1405.94s)]
*  It's just that not all the not everything is done and that you have to get the the rest of the program discovered and destroyed or rendered useless. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1410.94s)]
*  And it can be done militarily or it can be done diplomatically. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1421.94s)]
*  But I think the the what Israel's accomplished in a little over a week is very successful. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1425.94s)]
*  So we've talked about in the times we've talked about is for both conversion facilities. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1433.94s)]
*  The fact that the Israeli strike destroyed the uranium metal facility, which could be reconstituted and the facility to make uranium hexafluoride and the facility to make uranium hexafluoride. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1438.94s)]
*  But they've got large stockpiles of no, not so much of enriched uranium. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1450.94s)]
*  Well, no, uranium hexafluoride. Correct. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1454.94s)]
*  Natural, which is what they need to run an enrichment program in the long run. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1457.94s)]
*  So we talked about the fact that they were close for four to six months. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1462.94s)]
*  I believe that's what your institute had assessed to develop a crude nuclear device to actually make it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1466.94s)]
*  And you think that has been set back. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1472.94s)]
*  Let's just go to the final or two nodes of this nuclear program for now in Iraq, because I want to understand your assessment of the damage that was done to both. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1474.94s)]
*  Let's let's jump to Iraq and then we'll end with four dough because that's obviously got the most attention. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1485.94s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the Iraq heavy water reactor, where that was, what it's used for, where it was before the JCPO of 2015 and where it was today before the Israelis struck it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1489.94s)]
*  And it was it was a reactor design that Iran was creating in the 1990s with the help of Russian entities that were providing a key design assistance, designing the fuel. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1502.94s)]
*  And it was going to use natural uranium, heavy water, and it would be very nice to make weapon grade plutonium in. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1516.94s)]
*  And they hit it. It's one of these Iranian lies that they were faster in building the heavy water production plant. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1525.94s)]
*  And that's what the Iranian opposition group pointed out as facility near Iraq. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1534.94s)]
*  And that's where it got its name. And Iran's line after that was, well, we just want to have heavy water. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1539.94s)]
*  We want to sell it. You know, in three years, three months later, four months later, they realized the absurdity of that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1545.94s)]
*  And they admit, oh, yeah, we're going to be building a reactor next to this heavy water production plant. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1551.94s)]
*  And it became a major bone of contention in the in the negotiations of the JCPOA, where the U.S. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1557.94s)]
*  insisted that it that the core be changed so it couldn't run on natural uranium. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1563.94s)]
*  It could only it would run on enriched uranium and much less plutonium would be made in it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1569.94s)]
*  And it would be poor quality plutonium. And it was a big struggle. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1574.94s)]
*  And Iran fought this kind of core change. But the United States stuck to its gun and got it through. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1579.94s)]
*  Moreover, they got through that that the fuel would would be made in such a way that would be very hard to chemically process, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1586.94s)]
*  because it also was discovered that Iran was trying to put together the capability to separate the fuel and end up with. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1594.94s)]
*  Well, let me say it this way. Process the fuel and end up with separated plutonium. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1605.94s)]
*  So they have a plutonium pathway to the bomb. And it appears to have been a project of the Atomic Energy Organization. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1609.94s)]
*  It was not part of Amman. There's very little plutonium work in Amman. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1617.94s)]
*  So the Atomic Energy Organization seemed to want to be able to have a capability to generate separated plutonium. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1623.94s)]
*  And and and it would be weapon grade plutonium. So you could use it. They could have their own bomb program. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1629.94s)]
*  So was Iraq proliferation proof before these strikes or was a concern that that Iraq could actually be repurposed and turned into a plutonium bomb producing facility? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1636.94s)]
*  Yeah, the original it's called the calendria, which holds the fuel rods. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1648.94s)]
*  It goes inside this core that holds the heavy water was destroyed. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1653.94s)]
*  But then Iran and its usual kind of I would say confused way kind of said, oh, by the way, we have another one. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1659.94s)]
*  Confused or duplicitous. Yeah. Well, it's why would they admit to it? I mean, it's always it's always amazing to me. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1668.94s)]
*  You know, sometimes Iran does reveal things. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1674.94s)]
*  So maybe someone doesn't just needed it politically to stick it to to somebody and felt they would suffer no consequences, which is essentially what happened. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1676.94s)]
*  And but so the reactor was never was never fully modified to this new way. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1686.94s)]
*  And it's been in kind of limbo where Iran says we're going to finish it or be commissioned by in twenty twenty six. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1693.94s)]
*  The work doesn't appear to be happening quickly, but it but Iran keeps saying we're going to finish it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1700.94s)]
*  And I think we've all learned that we should take them at their word. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1707.94s)]
*  And I think Israel just decided let's just be cautious and destroyed the the the reactor core. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1711.94s)]
*  As far as we can tell, it was they went through this the outer dome, concrete dome with at least three three weapons. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1720.94s)]
*  One would blow open the hole one or two, and then they went in, caused serious damage in the core area. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1730.94s)]
*  And then they also to be safe, took out a section of the heavy water production plant. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1737.94s)]
*  So so I think that Israel was trying to do what John Kerry always promised. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1742.94s)]
*  Make sure there's no plutonium pathway to the bomb. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1748.94s)]
*  OK, so we've talked about the Natanz enrichment facility destroyed. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1751.94s)]
*  We've talked about the Isfahan to conversion facilities destroyed. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1755.94s)]
*  We've talked about the Iraq heavy water reactor, which could make potentially make plutonium for plutonium bomb destroyed. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1759.94s)]
*  Now let's get the photo one that got a lot of attention. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1766.94s)]
*  And that certainly was what President Trump was most concerned about and ordered B-2 bombers to drop these 30,000 pound massive [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1769.94s)]
*  ordnance penetrators to to to try to do severe damage to the photo facility. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1777.94s)]
*  The U.S. has declared it's been obliterated. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1783.94s)]
*  President Trump has declared President Trump. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1786.94s)]
*  Thank you for the distinction. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1788.94s)]
*  President Trump has said it's been obliterated. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1789.94s)]
*  What's your assessment of how much damage was done to to Fordo? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1792.94s)]
*  Well, we could only look at the the holes in the surface, you know, what's ejected and then and also compare to the design of the plant. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1796.94s)]
*  We have the design of the plant thanks to the Nuclear Archive, because as I mentioned, the plant was designed during the Ahmad Plan. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1808.94s)]
*  And David, to say a few words about the the Nuclear Archive and how we know even more about this Ahmad crash nuclear weapons program. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1815.94s)]
*  Again, this is a result of of Mossad. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1824.94s)]
*  Correct. That's right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1826.94s)]
*  Seizing the this archive, learning about the archive and then seizing it in 2018. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1827.94s)]
*  And they decided to share it with the world. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1833.94s)]
*  And so they gave whole copies to the United States, Britain, France, the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1837.94s)]
*  And you saw it as well. Correct. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1845.94s)]
*  And I and we saw quite I saw quite a bit of and wrote on it extensively. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1846.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1849.94s)]
*  That's right. With people from FDD, Ali Hynone and Andrea Stricker. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1850.94s)]
*  And so we produced, I don't know, 20 reports looking at the various aspects of the Ahmad Plan. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1856.94s)]
*  And then and then we produced a book. So we went through it a lot. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1862.94s)]
*  Went and saw the archive. I saw it twice. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1867.94s)]
*  Andrea was with me one of the times and and had four visits to just meet with the Mossad people who did analyzing the people analyzing the archive to just meet with them to collect documents and then be able to interview them about different aspects of what they were finding and what things meant. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1869.94s)]
*  So John Kerry said in 2015 when people were criticizing the JCPOA that the Iranians hadn't come clean on their nuclear program and with full disclosure and transparency that it didn't matter because we knew everything we needed to know about Iran's nuclear weapons program turned out that with Mossad taking the archive in this daring operation in 2018 and pulling out the details of the Ahmad Plan. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1892.94s)]
*  I think we learned we learned more. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1916.94s)]
*  Al Ghadir was not known. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1918.94s)]
*  And it was a surprise to the Israelis too. So, I mean, we when we charted up the all the facilities in Ahmad came up with about 20 facilities or activities that were being carried on it and safeguarded facilities, making five proof up to 5% of rich uranium and tons to give to Fordow. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1920.94s)]
*  So they could make weapon grade that would be an activity that we charted up and there were about 20 23 half were not known and and half of the sites were not known half the sites and this is from straight from the Mossad people to analyzing the documents understand that so you're saying in 2015 John Kerry says we know everything we need to know about the nuclear program. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1945.94s)]
*  The Mossad goes in grabs a nuclear archive and we look at it and we look at all the sites and the details and more side also says there are half these sites that we don't know that and they can't speak for us intelligence but I'm pretty safe that to say that what us intelligence knows often comes from [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1966.94s)]
*  Yeah, on this and so I think the it was it would the archive was belittled at the time but it was a profound. I think it's the greatest espionage atomic espionage action, it pulled off and and to get this complete rendition of a secret nuclear weapons program was it was a phenomenal success and it and it and it's and really has fed into International Atomic Energy Agency. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=1987.94s)]
*  And the Atomic Energy Agency actions certainly we benefited but it's it's helped understand the whole how do you how do you stop this program that there was a complete roster of employees. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2016.94s)]
*  Of the amount of the not the Ford out not the Al Gideon people a lot had things like laser enrichment. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2031.94s)]
*  The gas centrifuge enrichment but on the weaponization part to make the bomb itself there was a complete roster of employees with you know names fathers names national IDs education and so it it's a wonderful source of intelligence to be able to follow because the mod people when that program ended. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2041.94s)]
*  The nuclear weapons program didn't end but but they they then went into successor organizations where they you know from our view of the ideas. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2064.94s)]
*  And and do things that are under the rubric the supreme leader has not given approval to build the bomb. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2072.94s)]
*  David I don't think I actually realized that I mean I was very focused on the capabilities and the the nodes and the sites and the details that came out of the nuclear archive but what you're actually describing is it's that but it's also the names and details of the scientists who actually worked on that program. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2088.94s)]
*  Some of whom many of whom may still be alive many of them that probably it's been a long time 20 years for many moved on but many are still working at the final successor organization SPND and some were caught or detected working at all the mod sites recently and on question. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2108.94s)]
*  So must have helped Mossad put together its list of known nuclear scientists who are actively engaged in this program and you can see who they know who they work with what it so you it's it's invaluable and I think. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2128.94s)]
*  And I think the intelligence value of the archive has been tremendous and it's also been tremendously important just to show what this what Iran has done and that this and I think one of the things that I feel the US intelligence assessment did in a very negative way. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2142.94s)]
*  Yeah and I only talk about what's in the unclassified version I have no idea the nuances but but it would worry me greatly if what I'm going to say about the unclassified version is somehow it's different in the classified version but but it created this false dichotomy it's like a light switch either it's on or off stopped in 03 hadn't restarted in 07 and had and then they get these reports every year. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2164.94s)]
*  Yeah they're not building the bomb they're making parts it's in a sense it hasn't restarted and Tulsi Gabbard said the same thing just recently crap she was parodying the intelligence assessment the official one but what's changed in the last couple years is that I think there's so much evidence of reason. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2188.94s)]
*  Accelerated work that the intelligence people have either leaked or said that Iran shortening the time frame it may need to build a nuclear weapon but they then say no but there is no program started but but that's it's sort of I don't know what to call it it's a logical thing that's not the point. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2206.94s)]
*  Well John Radcliffe the CIA director I think put it really well in the in recent weeks when he said you know Ron got to the 99 yard line of a football game right and a team that's on the 99 yard line has the intention to score a touchdown. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2224.94s)]
*  That's right and that's another way to put it but it's also what it what it is is that the public thinks often and you hear it all the time there is no nuclear weapons program in Iran so what's the concern and that and and and if they do the analysis in the sense of you know it why would they make 60% in this large quantity why would they have done that. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2240.94s)]
*  And 60% is 99% of what you need for weapons grade uranium. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2262.94s)]
*  And that's outside the on classify that intelligence assessment they said we don't consider if it's the issue of it's safeguarded and yet that's that symbolizes the whole problem with the intelligence assessment that that it's not about a decision by the supreme leader it's about preparing being ready speeding up the process if you are decided. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2266.94s)]
*  And it's a little bit like a weapon ear saying you know be confronted with building the bomb and he says to his leadership well I haven't thought about that in 10 years you know why don't you give me five to finish I mean there if they if the leadership decides to have the bomb it's going to want it quickly and so I think the what Israel's trying to do is that it understands the nuclear weapons capabilities the weaponization as we call it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2291.94s)]
*  And and it's decided to try to make it much harder for Iran to actually build the bomb itself. And that's it again I don't support killing scientists but that's why they did it was to try to erase some of the experience and and force Iran to bring up a new generation that takes time. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2320.94s)]
*  They've they went after the headquarters of SP and D. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2341.94s)]
*  So SP and D. Just explain to our viewers a few words on SP and D. That that is the central headquarters. Yeah. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2345.94s)]
*  And it was run by it was one of it was like the third or so successor organizations to to to Ahmad capturing the people who worked in a mod and and and and most in Fakhrasati finally started SP and D. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2352.94s)]
*  around 2011 but he also grew it. I mean he he turned it into kind of us an Iranian version of DARPA to be able to do all kinds of advanced military research. But in it where the Ahmad people they still worked on high explosive projects relevant to nuclear weapons they worked on. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2368.94s)]
*  And they kept their skillsets intact and and we believe at the Institute solved some of the bottlenecks in making a neutron initiator or keeping making sure your your current on on using multipoint initiation systems to that set off the high explosives. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2387.94s)]
*  So I think it's right. You brought you brought up most of our guys that it worth worth remembering this. This was for many people. He was considered sort of the Robin Robert Oppenheimer of Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2410.94s)]
*  We call them the Groves Leslie Groves. Explain that for a sec. Well, if you haven't seen Oppenheimer. Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2421.94s)]
*  Yeah. You remember the character? Oppenheimer was in charge of one aspect of the bomb making the the the weapon the weaponization. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2426.94s)]
*  Fakhrasati and Leslie Grove was in charge of making sure you had the fissile material. You had the the delivery system, you know, all the he didn't run a missile bomber program but he may had to make sure that there was a bomb that could be delivered. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2436.94s)]
*  And so he had he had it was a huge organizational challenge. And so Groves wasn't a nuclear expert. But he was an organizational planning expert. That's right. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2453.94s)]
*  And a tremendous manager and Fakhrasati was that he was also also a physicist and knew about centrifuges knew about weapons design. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2465.94s)]
*  So he had a he was more technical, but still it was his managerial capabilities that I think were the most important. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2473.94s)]
*  And Mossad killed him in a quite a daring operation where he was taken out inside Iran on his way back from his as I recall his his country house to Tehran, where a a if I remember it was a gun that was brought in and one ton gun that was brought in and [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2482.94s)]
*  parts reassembled inside Iran put on a flatbed truck mounted. He knew about the route back from his country house to Tehran. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2501.94s)]
*  And as he was approaching he was driving the car at the time with his wife next to him as I recall his bodyguards in different cars. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2510.94s)]
*  A sharpshooter sniper sitting in Tel Aviv was able to use AI to calibrate the shot and eliminate the lag because 2000 kilometer distance and take out Mossad Fakhrasati in his car without harming his wife or his bodyguards. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2518.94s)]
*  And that was that was the end of Mossad Fakhrasati. Of course he gets replaced and I've seen reports that at least 10 senior nuclear weapons scientists on the Mossad list were eliminated. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2541.94s)]
*  I've also heard there may be an additional four that have been taken out that haven't been publicly reported, but that that's somewhere between 10 and 14 of the senior weapons scientists on Mossad's target list. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2552.94s)]
*  And I assume if it's on Mossad's target list, they're there for a reason. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2563.94s)]
*  Yeah, no, and it's and most of the names that we see are related to the weaponization side. There's there's one who worked on centrifuge. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2567.94s)]
*  The theoretical aspects of centrifuge development and operation, but it largely was skill sets needed for the weapon side and also to train. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2577.94s)]
*  I mean, these people are they can have they can work in SP&D. They can then teach at the university. Fakhrasati was also a professor. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2589.94s)]
*  And their IRGC run universities. So their whole purpose is to feed the military industrial complex, including the nuclear. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2599.94s)]
*  So it did. So places like Shaheed Basheti University really should be viewed as as military facilities and and many in most of these people have positions there. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2609.94s)]
*  Actually, it's interesting. Fakhrasati, as I understand the reason he was driving back from his country house to Tehran that fateful day was he was going back to teach a class. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2622.94s)]
*  Yeah, he was more open the last year of his life. I mean, he started he was a mystery figure for years. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2631.94s)]
*  And then suddenly he started showing up at a kind of non non military or non nuclear events and and would be filmed and he'd be on the Internet giving speeches. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2637.94s)]
*  And and so I think he he I think he probably felt he was safer and wanted probably wanted to, I don't know, be in the public domain more. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2650.94s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of hard to figure out and get the credit for what he had done. But let me let me link it back to Fordow. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2663.94s)]
*  We were we were talking about battle damage assessment. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2668.94s)]
*  And then I also want to just tie it back to what the Israelis seem to know, which I mean, Fakhrasati is just one example. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2672.94s)]
*  But we've seen over the past 10 days, just an extraordinary Mossad and IDF penetration of the highest echelons of Iran's nuclear military and security apparatus, which does sort of then start to raise the question. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2679.94s)]
*  If those trucks at Fordow were taking out centrifuges and enriched material, we don't know if they were taking out if they were. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2696.94s)]
*  Yeah, if they were. But even enriched material, it could be it needs to be tracked down. Right. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2702.94s)]
*  So even if enriched material, it may be tracked down. Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2707.94s)]
*  And it may be in, you know, feed and withdraw equipment. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2710.94s)]
*  It may have been, you know, tanks of five percent enriched uranium that are pretty heavy. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2713.94s)]
*  So it's it's hard to know. And and but it but it's something left the site and that needs to be discovered. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2720.94s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm promised to that. And Yahoo in recent days has hinted at that in his public comments is that, you know, they're they're tracking the enriched material, presumably the 60 percent enriched material. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2729.94s)]
*  But you were saying that in terms of your ability to assess battle damage on Fordow, your institute obviously had the blueprints for what it looks like. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2740.94s)]
*  Use the satellite imagery to try to figure out what kind of damage has been done both on the surface, but more importantly, below the surface. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2749.94s)]
*  Any any sense? Well, one of the things that struck me right away when I looked at the the first Maxar satellite images was that some of the the. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2757.94s)]
*  Three holes are right by the ventilation system and and and we were able to confirm that the ventilation system went in as designed because we went back and looked at the old imagery and could see the this ventilation system being constructed on the surface. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2769.94s)]
*  And so it goes from the kind of near the top of the ridge line all the way down into one side of the underground complex. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2788.94s)]
*  So it does go all the way down and and the three there are three holes near the ventilation system. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2796.94s)]
*  So those were going through a part of the mountain that was had either been vacated for the ventilation system or was softer rock, if I can put it that way. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2803.94s)]
*  And so I would imagine those got through and cause some amount of damage. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2816.94s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting because again, I think I had missed that. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2820.94s)]
*  I heard you talking about that the Israeli option was to go after the ventilation system and drop bombs down that system because you just ended. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2823.94s)]
*  I mean, if you have to have ventilation to make right work, right. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2831.94s)]
*  But you're also saying that also would be potentially a softer, softer way to target in terms of the rock formation as a way to get in. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2834.94s)]
*  So, David, I mean, I ask you to speculate, but and it's difficult because I know you do extraordinary technical analysis. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2841.94s)]
*  Don't like to speculate. But what's your sense? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2847.94s)]
*  Do you think Fordo has sustained the kind of damage that would take years to rebuild? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2850.94s)]
*  Is it has it been rendered? Well, that we don't know. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2855.94s)]
*  We don't know, because in the end, you need some intelligence information. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2857.94s)]
*  I mean, there was we haven't tried to look at any subsidence in the ground if something collapsed. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2861.94s)]
*  But the holes aren't that big and it's under 80 meters of rock. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2866.94s)]
*  And so it's it's it's a destruction. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2870.94s)]
*  If the ceiling cracks, you better not go in there and then you just have to abandon it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2874.94s)]
*  So so I think it's a little tricky to assess, but it doesn't have to be that the ceiling collapses and crushes everything. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2880.94s)]
*  So to put it out of permanent operation. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2889.94s)]
*  But I would imagine the US and Israel are trying to collect intelligence information through communication intercepts, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2893.94s)]
*  which probably right now are a little harder, but recruiting people who may have been in the program that know what's going on and trying to. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2900.94s)]
*  This happened a lot after the ninety one war against Saddam Hussein were people. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2909.94s)]
*  A lot of that program, nuclear weapons program, was not known in 1991 after the war ended. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2915.94s)]
*  And there have been lots of bombing of facilities. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2920.94s)]
*  Many of the nuclear weapons sites were never touched in any significant way. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2923.94s)]
*  They may have been hit accidentally because they had a transformer or something. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2926.94s)]
*  But in general, many were not touched. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2931.94s)]
*  But after the war and people in the program started to see that there's no future here, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2933.94s)]
*  they would come out with information and revealed, for example, this massive enrichment program using calutrons, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2939.94s)]
*  which was definitely not known to the Israelis or the United States. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2947.94s)]
*  But this one person coming out revealed the whole complex. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2950.94s)]
*  He had moved from site to site sort of in a in a support role and knew where everything was. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2954.94s)]
*  So let me summarize where we are for the last 10 minutes. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2959.94s)]
*  And because then I want you to talk about what we might be missing. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2962.94s)]
*  What is that potential facility capability that the Iranians may still have? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2966.94s)]
*  But let me summarize from what I understand. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2972.94s)]
*  Please correct me if I if I'm overly simplifying this. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2974.94s)]
*  The United States and Israel together have rendered the tons. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2978.94s)]
*  It's for conversion facilities for Doe and Iraq. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2982.94s)]
*  Let's call it non-operational. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2986.94s)]
*  There's a question for how long it would take to rebuild. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2988.94s)]
*  But right now they're non-operational. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2991.94s)]
*  The Israelis have eliminated 10, maybe 14 of the top nuclear weapons scientists, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=2994.94s)]
*  including those who were involved in some of whom may be involved in the original Ahmad program, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3001.94s)]
*  some of whom are younger, but have gotten only the technical skills, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3007.94s)]
*  but the operational and planning skills to run a a sophisticated weaponization program [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3011.94s)]
*  that could actually produce either a device and or a warhead that you would have fixed to a missile. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3019.94s)]
*  And the Israelis have shown extraordinary intelligence penetration. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3026.94s)]
*  The United States and Israel have shown extraordinary air force capabilities [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3033.94s)]
*  in terms of taking out these sites or rendering them non-operational. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3038.94s)]
*  But let me ask you what could be remaining and what the Iranian play would be. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3042.94s)]
*  We briefly touched on this potential enrichment facility at Isfahan. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3047.94s)]
*  I'm sure that Israel and the United States haven't destroyed every centrifuge. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3052.94s)]
*  It seems like they went after centrifuge manufacturing facilities. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3056.94s)]
*  All three were hit. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3060.94s)]
*  All three of the three we know were destroyed. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3062.94s)]
*  So their ability to actually manufacture additional centrifuges has been set back. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3064.94s)]
*  But they have they had thousands of centrifuges to begin with, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3070.94s)]
*  including advanced models that are you need smaller numbers and because because they're more powerful [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3074.94s)]
*  and because you need smaller numbers, they're easier to hide. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3080.94s)]
*  It's surely a safe assumption to believe that Iran has deeply buried tunnels, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3083.94s)]
*  not only in Isfahan, but throughout the country. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3088.94s)]
*  So let me give you the scenario and tell me why we need to worry less about this than than I am. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3091.94s)]
*  Iran just takes whatever it has left. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3099.94s)]
*  It takes its advanced centrifuges. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3102.94s)]
*  It takes its stockpile of 60 percent enriched material. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3104.94s)]
*  It moves that into a deep tunnel. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3108.94s)]
*  Maybe it's this Isfahan facility. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3112.94s)]
*  Maybe it's somewhere else. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3114.94s)]
*  And they begin to they spin up the 60 into 90 percent weapons grade uranium. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3115.94s)]
*  So now they have 90 percent bombs worth, multiple bombs worth potentially of weapons grade uranium. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3120.94s)]
*  Now they have to take that and turn it into something right because enriched material is is not threatening unless it's turned into a bomb. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3128.94s)]
*  And for that, they need weapon scientists and they need uranium metal. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3137.94s)]
*  Uranium metal has been destroyed, but they may have the ability to reconstitute that quickly. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3142.94s)]
*  They may have some other facility we don't even know about in order to produce uranium metal. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3146.94s)]
*  And even though 10 to 14 top weapons scientists have been eliminated, they have others. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3151.94s)]
*  Combine that with the fact that Israel owns the skies. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3156.94s)]
*  The United States owns the skies. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3159.94s)]
*  Israel has shown a willingness, certainly in Lebanon, to keep going back in even under a ceasefire and take out key Hezbollah capabilities and has made it very clear they will continue to do that in Iran. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3161.94s)]
*  I assume the United States will continue to use its capabilities if there's any evidence that they get of an Iranian nuclear weapon breakout. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3172.94s)]
*  OK, that's my assessment. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3182.94s)]
*  OK, and now let me respond. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3184.94s)]
*  Now respond. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3186.94s)]
*  OK, one is I think I think first of all that there's been quite a bit of shock in the Iranian nuclear weapons establishment. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3187.94s)]
*  And so I think I think there would be scared to start a nuclear weapons program in the present circumstances. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3195.94s)]
*  And so I think mostly what they're trying to do is hide. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3203.94s)]
*  And yes, they could have, I would guess, two, three thousand advanced centrifuges that were made but not yet deployed. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3207.94s)]
*  I mean, they surprised us last year. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3215.94s)]
*  They deployed something like seven thousand or so advanced centrifuges at Fordow and Natan. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3217.94s)]
*  So I mean, they so some can be hidden. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3224.94s)]
*  They have these stocks. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3227.94s)]
*  Again, we don't probably not the whole stock. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3229.94s)]
*  They've lost some. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3231.94s)]
*  And so, yeah, they you have to worry about that. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3233.94s)]
*  But if they went to make a bomb, one is their communications has been disrupted. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3237.94s)]
*  They they're missing pieces that that they need. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3243.94s)]
*  And it's a linear process. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3246.94s)]
*  If one piece is missing, like making metal, you can't make the bomb. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3248.94s)]
*  And at any moment, they could be discovered and then blow the whole thing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3253.94s)]
*  So so I think I would be surprised if they were working on making weapon grade uranium now or thinking about making the bomb components themselves. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3257.94s)]
*  I mean, so that's my first reaction. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3266.94s)]
*  The other is this situation has to be dealt with. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3269.94s)]
*  The first wave, in a sense, was to deal with the larger infrastructure and the ability to to enrich uranium. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3271.94s)]
*  And in any but an insignificant or a small way, we're not called insignificant. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3282.94s)]
*  Now, what you have to do is either hunt down this stuff and that's and Mossad would would have to be the one responsible, probably assisted by the U.S. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3288.94s)]
*  But Mossad is typically the one that's going to push the envelope to find these things. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3298.94s)]
*  The other is you have to think about the endgame where in my mind, this is this the history is it doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme, according to this old adage. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3303.94s)]
*  And what the 1991 situation after the throwing Saddam out of Kuwait makes sense to me is a modified way that what we're looking for is a ceasefire deal. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3313.94s)]
*  And in that deal, it is a ceasefire deal. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3325.94s)]
*  It's not an arms control deal. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3329.94s)]
*  And in that ceasefire deal, Iran would stop its enrichment program, agree to dismantle it, and there would be inspections. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3331.94s)]
*  I don't think they don't need to be as intrusive as the ones in Iraq after 91. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3339.94s)]
*  But they would that Iran would be expected to cooperate and like that situation in 91, if they don't, then military action can be taken. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3344.94s)]
*  And it was. And so and again, it's not a long term plan. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3352.94s)]
*  You want to do this to dismantle the program under it. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3356.94s)]
*  And then that's where you could have more more confidence that you're getting all the 60 percent. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3360.94s)]
*  I know exactly how much was made and the same with the 20 percent, the five, the up to five percent. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3367.94s)]
*  And but you do it in that context. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3373.94s)]
*  And then what that means is don't make a deal too quickly. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3376.94s)]
*  Don't don't stop the war too soon. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3379.94s)]
*  You you want to make sure that that if this is going to work, that it is a ceasefire deal where Iran is agreeing to these conditions. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3381.94s)]
*  And it's not you can offer sanctions relief or not. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3389.94s)]
*  But it's really the main thing is, is that it's a very targeted goal to end enrichment and end the nuclear weapons related work. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3392.94s)]
*  And it's been done before. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3401.94s)]
*  And and we know how to do it. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3403.94s)]
*  And so will Iran agree? I don't know. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3406.94s)]
*  But I think but in terms of thinking about the problem, that's what we should be thinking of not not having a deal where, OK, now you don't enrich for a year. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3408.94s)]
*  Right. And in and in and Ron wants to claim they have a right to enrich. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3417.94s)]
*  Fine. So long as they don't and don't have the capability to enrich free to proclaim whatever right they want. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3421.94s)]
*  But I think that to me is the way forward. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3428.94s)]
*  And I and I hope the Trump administration would would be moving in that direction. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3431.94s)]
*  Yeah, no, it seems that there's always been that option for Hamenei. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3436.94s)]
*  He could either go to Oman or the United States and Israel would would go to Fordow. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3439.94s)]
*  It sounds like the United States and Israel got a Fordow. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3444.94s)]
*  And now it's an opportunity to go back to Oman and do that kind of agreement that permanently and fully dismantled Iran's nuclear program. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3447.94s)]
*  I just got a message that Iran has launched missiles at Qatar towards the other day. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3455.94s)]
*  The U.S. bases in Iraq. Yeah. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3459.94s)]
*  So a small number of missiles launched. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3461.94s)]
*  Obviously, there will be a lot more detail coming out. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3463.94s)]
*  But this could either be how many deciding to escalate and go after U.S. military bases in some kind of profound and sustained way, which which could be the end of his regime. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3466.94s)]
*  Or it could be a symbolic gesture in order to actually show we're still standing as a precursor move to going back to Oman and negotiating the kind of agreement that you're talking about. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3477.94s)]
*  Thank you, David. Thank you so much. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQFxKKaJJ8&t=3488.94s)]
