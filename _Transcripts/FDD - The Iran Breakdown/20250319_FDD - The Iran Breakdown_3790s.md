Video Description: Welcome to The Iran Breakdown, hosted by Mark Dubowitz.
If you know anything about Mark, you know he lives and breathes one mission: stopping a #nuclear #iran and ending the Islamic Republic.
Back in 2018, The New York Times put it this way: “Mark Dubowitz’s campaign to draw attention to what he saw as the flaws in the #irannuclear deal has taken its place among the most consequential ever undertaken by a Washington think tank leader.”
This excerpt was actually a hit piece that blamed Mark for President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal — the Times later issued multiple corrections to the piece because it was riddled with so many errors. 
A year later, The Atlantic dubbed FDD “D.C.’s ground zero for research and policy recommendations aimed at highlighting and fixing what Dubowitz saw as the flaws in the nuclear agreement.”
Even Tehran took notice. In 2019, the Islamic Republic sanctioned FDD and Mark, accusing them of being “the designing and executing arm of the U.S. administration” on Iran policy. *Guilty as charged.*
Why? Because a nuclear Iran isn’t just a threat — it’s _the_ threat. The regime’s race for the bomb is the most dangerous challenge coming out of Tehran, and in this episode, you'll learn why.
Here to help Mark break down Iran's nuclear file is Rich Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council as the director for countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction. He helped architect key parts of President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign — a campaign that aimed to block Iran’s every pathway to nuclear weapons. Or as the regime calls the campaign: "economic terrorism." Rich also served in the Senate and the House where he drafted many of the key pieces of legislation sanctioning the Islamic Republic. Like Mark, Rich is proudly sanctioned by the Islamic Republic.

*  You think that we're extorted today with the threat of nuclear weapons? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens when they actually go boom? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3.48s)]
*  I mean, and then they say, oh, you really want to come after us? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=5.48s)]
*  We might be able to go boom again. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=9.32s)]
*  Welcome to the Iran breakdown. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=11.16s)]
*  Let's break it down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=13.76s)]
*  Welcome to the Iran breakdown. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=15.36s)]
*  I'm your host, Mark Dubois. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=16.64s)]
*  If you know me, you know I live and breathe one mission, stopping a nuclear Iran and ending [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=18.28s)]
*  the Islamic Republic. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=22.16s)]
*  Back in 2018, the New York Times put it this way, quote, Mark Dubois's campaign to draw [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=23.16s)]
*  attention to what he saw as the flaws in the Iran nuclear deal has taken its place among [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=28.32s)]

*  That was an excerpt from the New York Times hit piece on me that blamed me for President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=37.52s)]
*  Trump's decision to withdraw from the Obama Iran deal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=40.96s)]
*  That had to print a major correction to the piece, by the way, because it was riddled [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=43.36s)]
*  with so many errors. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  A year later, the Atlantic dubbed the FTV, quote, DC's ground zero for research and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=48.120000000000005s)]

*  the nuclear agreement. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=57.92s)]
*  Even Tehran took notice in 2019, the Islamic Republic sanctioned FTV and me personally, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=60.08s)]
*  accusing us of being me, quote, designing and executing arm of the US administration [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=64.8s)]
*  on Iran policy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Guilty as charged. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Because a nuclear Iran isn't just a threat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  It's the threat. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=75.16s)]
*  The regime's race for the bomb is the most dangerous challenge coming out of Tehran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=76.16s)]
*  In this episode, we break down why. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=80.44s)]
*  Joining me today is someone who knows this file inside and out, FTV's Rich Goldberg. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=82.48s)]
*  When it comes to Iran's nuclear program, Rich matches my obsession step for step and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=87.76s)]
*  maybe even outpaces me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Rich served in the National Security Council as the director for countering Iranian weapons [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=94.76s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=98.12s)]
*  He helped architect key parts of President Trump's maximum pressure campaign, a campaign [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=99.68s)]
*  that aimed to block Iran's every pathway to nuclear weapons, or as the regime calls [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=104.28s)]
*  the campaign, economic terrorism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=108.92s)]
*  Rich also served in the Senate and in the House, where he drafted many of the key pieces [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=111.56s)]
*  of legislation sanctioning the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=114.96s)]
*  And yes, like me, Rich is proudly sanctioned by the Islamic Republic, as are six of our [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=117.88s)]
*  other FTV colleagues, eight in total. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  I've known Rich for decades, a friend, a colleague, and a hands down one of the sharpest minds [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  in the space. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=130.6s)]
*  There's no one better to walk us through the threat and the strategy to stop it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=131.6s)]
*  I'm Mark Dubwitz, and this is the Iran Breakdown. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=135.64s)]
*  So let's break it down. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=138.2s)]
*  Rich Goldberg, great to have you on the podcast. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=145.24s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=147.56s)]
*  I feel like we know each other and now we're on a podcast together. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=148.56s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's amazing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it occurs to me, Rich, I think I've known you almost two decades. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  I worked with you on Iran policy, beginning when you were a young staffer working for [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=156.8s)]
*  then Congressman Mark Kirk. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=161.52s)]
*  And then obviously in the Senate, we're working for Senator Kirk. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  And then Rich worked in the White House as the director in charge of countering Iran's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=167.72s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=173.12s)]
*  So big jobs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=175.4s)]
*  Also, I think you took some detours as chief of staff to governor round of Illinois and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=176.4s)]
*  served our country with distinction in the U.S. Navy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=181.96s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for your service. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank you for all you've done. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=188.84s)]
*  And I can think of no better person to talk about Iran policy under the Trump administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=189.84s)]
*  than you, Rich. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=194.36s)]
*  So let's break it down. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=195.44s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=198.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=199.28s)]
*  Let's begin where we are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=200.28s)]
*  Trump has come in. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=202.44s)]
*  He's facing a serious threat in terms of Iran's expanding nuclear program. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=203.44s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=209.92s)]
*  Position us with respect to the nuclear threat that we face and then we can talk about the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=210.92s)]
*  way forward. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=216.0s)]
*  So I always like to make analogies that translate this to people at home listening. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=217.28s)]
*  And if you're somebody who's watched the Super Bowl recently and you think about football [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=224.76s)]
*  I think the Iranians are sort of on the one yard line right now at the nuclear threshold. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=229.6s)]
*  Remember the three key legs of the nuclear stool for the Iranian nuclear weapons program. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=234.96s)]
*  You know this, Mark. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=240.12s)]
*  They need fissile material, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=241.12s)]
*  So they need the nuclear material that we always hear about in the news. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  They're enriching uranium. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=246.04s)]
*  They're at 60% high in rich uranium. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  They were caught at 84% high in rich uranium went by international inspectors. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=249.76s)]
*  They obviously are producing also 20% high in rich uranium. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=254.24s)]
*  They're producing low in rich uranium. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=256.92s)]
*  We know that weapons grade uranium threshold is 90%. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=259.12s)]
*  They're there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=263.76s)]
*  They're not actually producing it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=264.76s)]
*  Just to clarify, they've come really close to it and been caught there in the 80s. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=266.32s)]
*  But understanding that with all the advanced centrifuge technology that they have developed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=272.04s)]
*  and deployed over the last four years, they have reconfigured those centrifuges, put them [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=276.0s)]
*  into what we call cascades and designed their ability to produce weapons grade uranium when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=281.28s)]
*  they choose to do so. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=288.84s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=290.92s)]
*  I think they've proven to us the technical capacity. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=291.92s)]
*  And if you look at some of the estimates that are out there of how long it would take them [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  to take their current stockpiles of 60%, 20% and move to that 90% to have enough fissile [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  material for one bombs worth, we're talking about a long holiday weekend. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=305.88s)]
*  And then you add on days and weeks after that to get two bombs worth, three bombs worth, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=309.7s)]
*  four bombs worth and so on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=313.26s)]
*  And so from the fissile material threat, it's sort of in the rear view mirror. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=315.58s)]
*  There was a time at which we would say, oh, they just have this much stockpile. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=319.96s)]
*  They don't really know how to get the weapons grade. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=323.78s)]
*  They're still working on it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=325.46s)]
*  They're still doing R&D on advanced centrifuges. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=326.58s)]
*  I think that time has come and gone. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  And we should talk about what that means prospectively for any sort of arrangements that you would [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=331.82s)]
*  because it changes the dynamic fundamentally. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=337.78s)]
*  That's one leg of the stool. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=341.34s)]
*  Second leg of the stool, delivery systems. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  If you had a nuclear weapon, how would you deliver it? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=346.14s)]
*  Well, they have ballistic missile, they have cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=349.02s)]
*  weapons and they've proven that they know how to use them and they will use them in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  fact. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=359.14s)]
*  And twice last year we saw them use ballistic missiles against the state of Israel for the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=360.14s)]
*  first time in history. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=364.02s)]
*  So the delivery systems are there and continue to be tested. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=365.74s)]
*  And by the way, we know that they have a space launch vehicle program that's a cover for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=369.62s)]
*  an ICBM program, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Program. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=373.54s)]
*  They're working on the delivery system not just to hit Israel or Europe, they want to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=377.3s)]
*  hit the continental United States. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=381.74s)]
*  The Defense Department, our intelligence community has been telling us that for years and they [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=384.46000000000004s)]
*  continue working towards that goal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=387.62s)]
*  So the material, they are already there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=390.3s)]
*  Delivery system certainly against Israel, against Europe is there, soon to be potentially [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=393.68s)]
*  against the United States. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=397.98s)]
*  And then the last question is the weapon itself, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=400.32s)]
*  That's the part that we've never been able to say, gotcha, you're doing the weapon. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=404.06s)]
*  You know, we had the intelligence community telling us that they halted the formal weapon [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=408.12s)]
*  program. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=411.9s)]
*  Back in 2003, we had evidence from the International Atomic Energy Agency showing that at least [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=413.9s)]
*  it went on in different ways through 2009. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=419.16s)]
*  The nuclear archive that the Israelis found, the Mossad brought out of Iran back in 2018, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=423.8s)]
*  shows us details and then some of these sites that the UN has tried to get into and has [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=429.2s)]
*  taken soil samples to in certain places, finding evidence of nuclear material. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=433.82s)]
*  All sort of has alarm bells going off saying, we think something's still happening somewhere, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=438.72s)]
*  but nobody can say here it is, smoking gun, you're working on the weapon here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=444.48s)]
*  We know that there's a secret nuclear military organization called SPND with nuclear weapons [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=449.12s)]
*  scientists still employed, which was headed until his death by the godfather of the nuclear [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=454.48s)]
*  weapons program, Osama Fakhrizadeh. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=460.0s)]
*  But we haven't been able to say you're doing weapon work and the IC, the intelligence community, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=461.6s)]
*  never changed its position since 2007 that the program had halted and there was no formal [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  weaponization activity going on until recently. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=472.68s)]
*  We know now in the last few months that has changed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=477.56s)]
*  Now you have people caveating and saying different, well, we don't think they're making a nuclear [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=481.24s)]
*  weapon today, but no longer can the intelligence community tell us that Iran is not engaged [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=487.6s)]
*  in a weaponization activity. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=494.32s)]
*  In fact, we have leaked unclassified reports saying that they are working on computer modeling [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=495.76s)]
*  towards a weapon, which the UN itself, the JCPOA, the old Iran nuclear deal called a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=501.9s)]
*  weaponization activity. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  It's obviously one of the first steps as you're testing, as you're thinking about how, by [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=509.58s)]
*  the way, the United States doesn't test nuclear weapons today. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=514.02s)]
*  We haven't done it in many, many, many years. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=516.1s)]
*  How do we test our nuclear stockpile? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=517.9s)]
*  Right, so computer modeling. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=518.9s)]
*  Computer modeling. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=519.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=520.9s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=521.9s)]
*  It's not like nothing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=522.9s)]
*  This is a real part of weaponization activities that they're working on. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=525.54s)]
*  Why are they doing it? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=529.06s)]
*  What else are they doing? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=530.06s)]
*  They're working on it where we don't have answers to those questions. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=531.2199999999999s)]
*  One last thing I'll leave this topic with is what if they're not working towards a warhead? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=535.0999999999999s)]
*  What if they're not working on the miniaturization aspects that we all saw in the nuclear archives [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  and what we think they were working on back in 2003 in the Ahmad program and fitting a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=545.5s)]
*  nuclear weapon on a missile to deliver in a traditional sense and then building up a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=549.9s)]
*  stockpile of these nuclear weapons? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  What if they just want to go boom in the desert? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=556.5s)]
*  A crude nuclear device to do that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=559.02s)]
*  Well, that's a lot shorter amount of time, probably a lot easier to accomplish. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=561.42s)]
*  Which give us a sense of how long this will take. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=566.14s)]
*  The estimates of the US intelligence community about building a warhead versus a crash program [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=569.62s)]
*  and a crude nuclear device. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=574.66s)]
*  What are we talking about in terms of months, years? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=575.66s)]
*  The public estimates that you've seen are a year, 18 months depending on Israeli estimates, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=577.66s)]
*  American estimates. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=583.66s)]
*  To build a warhead. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=584.8s)]
*  On the warhead? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=585.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=586.8s)]
*  We're talking about six months or less on the crude nuclear device. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=587.8s)]
*  We don't know where they're at right now. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  Maybe they're already working on it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=593.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  Just to put a final point on that because there's been so much discussion about building [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  a warhead that they could have fixed a missile. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=599.76s)]
*  Why would Iran decide to short circuit it, do a crash program and just merely do a crude [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=603.28s)]
*  nuclear device in four to six months? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, you declare yourself a nuclear power. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  You show that you are a nuclear power. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=612.3599999999999s)]
*  You cross the threshold. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=614.56s)]
*  You don't actually know what else they're doing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=616.64s)]
*  You don't know where else they've built certain things. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=619.16s)]
*  Where did the material come from? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=623.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of hypotheticals built into this, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  If something goes boom, there was fissile material involved. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=627.54s)]
*  Did it get diverted? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=630.84s)]
*  Did they, in the known sites where the IAEA, the UN inspectors go and see things, did they [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=631.84s)]
*  close them down for a certain amount of time? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=637.86s)]
*  Did they say there was a fire in a facility while they start diverting nuclear material? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=639.88s)]
*  Is there some other place they're enriching uranium that we don't know about? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=645.18s)]
*  Is there a crash program somewhere? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  That would be involved. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=650.62s)]
*  If that ever happened, you would have to wonder how, what steps led to that moment. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=652.18s)]
*  But the minute it happens, the intel picture just gets flooded with reports of rumors of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=658.28s)]
*  this is going to happen. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=664.4599999999999s)]
*  Oh, Hezbollah has a suitcase bomb now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's a dirty bomb potential now to terrorist organizations. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=668.06s)]
*  I mean, just the whole strategic paradigm shifts. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=671.78s)]
*  Buying Iran more time, everybody's a little more afraid. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=675.9599999999999s)]
*  You think that we're extorted today with the threat of nuclear weapons? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=678.66s)]
*  What happens when they actually go boom? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, and then they say, oh, you really want to come after us? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  We might be able to go boom again. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=687.66s)]
*  Maybe we got more surprises for you in a couple months. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=688.9s)]
*  Which is two things I want you to address. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=691.38s)]
*  I mean, first of all, you've laid out today that Iran is a threshold nuclear weapons power, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=697.9799999999999s)]
*  It has the fissile material that produce multiple bombs. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=698.9799999999999s)]
*  It's got long range missiles to deliver it to Israel, Europe, and one day to the United [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=701.1s)]
*  States. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=705.22s)]
*  And it's begun initial weaponization work, which puts it on a pathway to develop a warhead [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=706.62s)]
*  or a crude nuclear device. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=712.1s)]
*  So two questions come out of that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=713.96s)]
*  The first is, when did all this nuclear expansion occur? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=715.82s)]
*  I mean, we had a nuclear deal in 2015. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=720.02s)]
*  President Trump withdrew from that deal in May of 2018. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=723.1s)]
*  And so give our listeners just a view of when all of this expansion occurred. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=727.06s)]
*  Did it occur under Trump? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=731.3s)]
*  It occurred under Biden? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  When did this actually happen? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  And the second thing to address is the JCPOA. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=736.26s)]
*  I mean, is it not fair to say that this is exactly what the JCPOA was designed to do, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=739.5799999999999s)]
*  was to prevent all of these pathways to nuclear weapons? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=743.8599999999999s)]
*  And which one we have been better off if we had stayed in the JCPOA and not withdrawn [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=747.26s)]
*  in 2018? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=751.26s)]
*  Would Iran be much further away from having nuclear weapons than they are today? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=753.18s)]
*  So I think we need to address that before we talk about the way forward. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=757.5s)]
*  There are two fundamental fatal flaws in the JCPOA that directly result in the threat in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=761.54s)]
*  front of us today. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=770.0999999999999s)]
*  And that threat was inevitable because of the JCPOA. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=771.62s)]
*  Two fundamental ones. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people talk about sunsets and, oh, they should have been longer sunsets. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=776.6999999999999s)]
*  I honestly, I could care less about sunsets because it's just being held to the promise [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=781.1s)]
*  of a radical Shiite maniac dictator in Iran who just wakes up one day and says, yeah, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=787.5s)]
*  I have a sunset. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=794.9s)]
*  It's today. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=796.5s)]
*  Thank you for whatever the JCPOA says. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=797.5s)]
*  Two things. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=800.5s)]
*  Number one, verification and number two, dismantlement. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=801.5s)]
*  Neither occurred. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=804.9s)]
*  The first thing you would do, you would think, in a business negotiation, in any negotiation, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=806.98s)]
*  is to say to the other party, show me everything you got. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  Declare your program. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=818.22s)]
*  I want maximum information on everything you currently are doing and have done so that [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=819.9s)]
*  I know if you're making a concession, so I know the extent of your activities and knowledge [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=825.34s)]
*  and advancement and who's worked on what and what facilities you have and how many things [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=830.02s)]
*  you put away somewhere. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=833.5s)]
*  They never came clean in the JCPOA. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=835.84s)]
*  They never were forced to declare all their past nuclear weapons activities and show a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=838.86s)]
*  chain of custody from 2003 onward to 2018. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=843.84s)]
*  In fact, when you see satellite imagery emerge in 2018 of sites, unexplained warehouses with [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=849.1600000000001s)]
*  containers being moved out of buildings, soil being thrown up and down to try to hide things [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=859.88s)]
*  from inspectors, multiple other sites inspected in 2019, 2020, showing the presence of nuclear [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=864.5999999999999s)]
*  materials completely unexplained, yet somehow we think tracing back to that nuclear weapons [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=872.64s)]
*  program, you have a fundamental breakdown in verification, which means anything they [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=879.1199999999999s)]
*  assured us in JCPOA, anything they conceded or said is a restriction, you have no idea [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=885.7199999999999s)]
*  of knowing if it's a restriction. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=891.38s)]
*  When then Secretary of State John Kerry was lead negotiator for the United States on the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=892.9200000000001s)]
*  JCPOA said at the time, Iran doesn't have to come clean because we know everything we [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=897.48s)]
*  need to know about Iran's nuclear program. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  What's your reaction to Kerry's assertion? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=905.6s)]
*  John Kerry did not know that there was a secret nuclear weapons archive sitting in a warehouse [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=909.88s)]
*  in Tehran. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=914.6s)]
*  He certainly never knew the contents of it and I don't think anybody else did until the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=915.6s)]
*  Israelis revealed it and we've learned a lot about the program from those documents. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=921.12s)]
*  And then you could go down the list of sites like Turkuzebad and others that have been [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=926.96s)]
*  visited by the IAEA. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=932.76s)]
*  John Kerry probably can't even spell it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=934.32s)]
*  He's never heard of them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=936.2800000000001s)]
*  So how does he know all about the program? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=938.2s)]
*  Never heard about these sites. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=939.64s)]
*  Why is there nuclear material there, Mr. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  Kerry? He has no idea because they've never fully come clean. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=942.0400000000001s)]
*  He's never been inside of a military site, by the way, neither has the IAEA. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=945.08s)]
*  They've never visited SPND offices. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=949.56s)]
*  Couldn't even tell you where they are. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=952.04s)]
*  No one's interviewed a nuclear weapons scientist and sat down and said, tell me what you did. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=953.88s)]
*  What do you mean? Nobody could tell me in accounting of exactly how many nuclear capable [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  missiles they are there they have and where they are. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=962.4799999999999s)]
*  So the program is completely unverified. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  There are aspects that are subject to verification, but in totality, the program is unverified. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=969.8s)]
*  Therefore, if I were conducting a negotiation and I don't even know what the person on the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=976.48s)]
*  other side of the table has to give up and I'm saying, sounds good. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=982.08s)]
*  You're making a really good concession here. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=986.08s)]
*  How do you know? You don't even know everything you got. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=988.2s)]
*  Right. So you can't verify what you don't know. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  That's one piece. Right. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=993.5600000000001s)]
*  And dismantlement? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=994.48s)]
*  Dismantlement. The minute we decided that we were just going to take Iran's promise to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=995.2s)]
*  not do certain things for now, for the moment or for 10 years or for 15 years. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't care how long they promise for. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1006.28s)]
*  If you allow them to keep R&D on centrifuges, you allow them to keep facilities open. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1008.64s)]
*  They will just wait around for that moment where they turn a key and they whip it back out. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1016.24s)]
*  And then they deploy more advanced centrifuges and then they figure out and then they can just [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1021.76s)]
*  enrich uranium. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1026.08s)]
*  So that's exactly what's happened. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1027.76s)]
*  The only piece of the JCPOA where you had like a sort of dismantlement was at the Iraq [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1030.08s)]
*  Heavy Water Reactor, which dealt with the plutonium threat, the plutonium pathway to a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1036.04s)]
*  bomb. And even then what happened was they poured concrete into the core to render it [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1040.84s)]
*  dysfunctional until such time under the JCPOA. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1047.84s)]
*  They were supposed to retrofit the facility away from being one that could be a plutonium [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1050.8s)]
*  threat. Somebody can explain that one to you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1055.52s)]
*  But, you know, there's all these architectural models of how you're going to work it so it [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1058.68s)]
*  can't actually be used to be a plutonium threat in the future. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1062.16s)]
*  Never happened during JCPOA, never moved forward. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1065.88s)]
*  They always had delays. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1068.1200000000001s)]
*  And they announced after we got out of JCPOA and during the Trump administration that they [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  had hidden from inspectors pipes that are needed to rebuild the core and could do so at a [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1074.68s)]
*  moment's notice if they wanted to. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1082.0s)]
*  So they had no intention of abandoning the facility. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1084.28s)]
*  We didn't destroy the facility. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1086.3200000000002s)]
*  It was just we poured concrete into some pipes, into the core, which apparently they could [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1088.48s)]
*  just rebuild. The key enrichment facilities that we know about, we're talking about Natanz, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1094.4s)]
*  Fordow. They weren't dismantled. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1102.44s)]
*  They weren't destroyed. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1104.76s)]
*  They were like retrofitted. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1106.64s)]
*  In certain cases, we actually legitimized enrichment to continue like at Natanz. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1108.44s)]
*  And in Fordow, we said, yeah, you can keep this massive under a mountain facility that is [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1113.84s)]
*  completely dangerous and could one day be a nuclear weapons threat to us. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can keep it open and not destroy it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1125.36s)]
*  And we'll have the Russians come in and do radioisotope research in there and it'll be [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1128.48s)]
*  wonderful. What a great use for this nuclear weapons facility. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1133.16s)]
*  I mean, are you insane? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1136.44s)]
*  So no dismantlement, no verification. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1138.0s)]
*  So what happens? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1141.92s)]
*  And by the way, Rich, I mean, I wanted you to talk a little bit about this because the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1143.0400000000002s)]
*  deal was reached in 2015, right? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  A number of restrictions that were temporary that would sunset. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1148.5200000000002s)]
*  We're now in 2025. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  And talk a little bit about where we would have been had we stayed in the JCPOA and where [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1155.0s)]
*  we were heading in the next five years. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1160.48s)]
*  And if you could also talk about the other side of the deal, because a lot of folks focus [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  on nuclear physics, but they forget about the economic sanctions relief side of the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1166.0s)]
*  deal and the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars that Iran would otherwise have [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1169.88s)]
*  gotten as part of the deal. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1173.64s)]
*  Yeah. So if you go from 2015 to 2030, let's use like this 15 year time frame, you're [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1175.8400000000001s)]
*  going through a process where Iran gets everything. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1181.72s)]
*  They get massive sanctions relief. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1186.8400000000001s)]
*  All of the tools of economic pressure get put into a lockbox under the deal. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1188.88s)]
*  Can't use that. They can sponsor terrorism. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1194.2s)]
*  They can build their long range missiles. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1196.4s)]
*  They can foment wars throughout the Middle East. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1198.36s)]
*  They can plot plot assassinations. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1201.36s)]
*  The United States, anything you want. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1203.4399999999998s)]
*  All the sanctions that you would use against the regime are off the table. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1206.52s)]
*  Central Bank of Iran, oil, sector based sanctions, everything. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1211.28s)]
*  Gold, precious metals, everything is gone. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1217.3999999999999s)]
*  OK, so now you've handcuffed the United States with sanctions pressure across non-nuclear [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1220.08s)]
*  threats, by the way, in addition to the nuclear threat in exchange for what? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1226.0s)]
*  Well, in 2020. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1230.76s)]
*  Oh, they get more, by the way. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1233.44s)]
*  Oh, that's right. It's not in exchange for what we give them more in 2020. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1235.0s)]
*  The UN arms embargo, conventional arms embargo will go away. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1238.36s)]
*  Now they can. Right. And it went away. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1242.0s)]
*  It went away. Yeah. Oh, and then a couple of years later, 2023, 2023. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1244.08s)]
*  Yeah. A missile embargo will go away, too. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1248.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it went away. And it went away. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1251.56s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, guess what they waited for until that missile embargo went away. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1253.32s)]
*  Transferring ballistic missiles, transferring drones to Russia. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1258.8s)]
*  Right. After the arms embargo went away, drones went to Russia. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1263.2s)]
*  After the missile embargo went away, ballistic missiles went to Russia. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  Totally predictable. So wait a second. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1270.08s)]
*  So what are we getting out of this, Kim? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1272.64s)]
*  OK, so they've refrained from enriching uranium above a certain amount, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1274.28s)]
*  above a certain stockpile at one facility, while the other one's still open as well, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1279.3200000000002s)]
*  doing weird scientific R&D or something on radioisotope, supposedly. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  The Iraq reactor has been temporarily disabled [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1288.96s)]
*  for a certain amount of time until they would choose to rebuild it, which is a good thing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1291.96s)]
*  But all of a sudden, 2024 comes around, 2025 comes around. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1297.8000000000002s)]
*  Their work on advanced centrifuges is legalized. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1303.16s)]
*  They can start deploying more and more of these advanced centrifuges [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1306.6s)]
*  and figure out how to make weapons-grade uranium the way that they did over the last four years. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1309.52s)]
*  And then as you get to 2030, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1316.2s)]
*  basically everything's legitimate. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1319.28s)]
*  They figured out how to make the weapons-grade uranium [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1321.44s)]
*  using the sunsets for advanced centrifuges. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1324.52s)]
*  Now they can. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1328.0s)]
*  You're actually allowed under the deal in year 15 to make weapons-grade uranium. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1329.36s)]
*  The one thing they can't do is make a nuclear weapon. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1334.32s)]
*  But by the way, over that 15 year period, I mean, what is that? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1338.36s)]
*  One point five trillion dollars. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1341.52s)]
*  How much money have they reaped into their coffers? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1342.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think our colleagues at FTD had estimated over [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1346.28s)]
*  certainly over a trillion dollars in sanctions relief to fortify the economy, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1349.2399999999998s)]
*  have a massive slash fund to finance their proxies. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1354.0s)]
*  So basically, just by being patient, taking patient pathways to nuclear weapons, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  they get a massive economic windfall and you end up in 2030. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1362.68s)]
*  Essentially where we are today, except for the fact that today [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  the economy is on its knees, the real is collapsed, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1370.8000000000002s)]
*  has lost like 99.99 percent of its value since the revolution. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1374.0800000000002s)]
*  What does Yemen look like in 2030 under that deal? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1378.1200000000001s)]
*  What does Syria look like? What does Iraq look like? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1380.8000000000002s)]
*  What does Gaza look like? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1382.72s)]
*  What are all these places? Totally entrenched. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1383.76s)]
*  The region is owned by Iran. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1386.1200000000001s)]
*  That's very wealthy. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1388.0400000000002s)]
*  The missile program has advanced unfettered. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1389.76s)]
*  Can't do anything about it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1393.44s)]
*  They probably have ICBMs at that point. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1394.48s)]
*  And they know how to make weapons, great uranium. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1397.28s)]
*  So let me ask you this, because I remember, I mean, we, you know, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1399.92s)]
*  we spent a lot of time criticizing the the JCPOA. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1402.84s)]
*  You spent a lot of time advocating for President Trump to withdraw from the deal. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1407.32s)]
*  You and I are member writing a piece in the first week of the new Biden [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1410.96s)]
*  administration and was advice to our friends on the Biden administration, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  to Jake Sullivan and Brett McGurk and others who were coming in [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1419.76s)]
*  about a new Iran policy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1423.1999999999998s)]
*  President Biden obviously had spent a lot of time in the campaign trail [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1425.3999999999999s)]
*  criticizing maximum pressure, saying that the maximum pressure campaign [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1429.6s)]
*  of President Trump had failed and that he would come in with a new policy. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1433.1999999999998s)]
*  Talk a little bit about what that policy became [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1437.56s)]
*  and what we had advised them to do, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1441.36s)]
*  which clearly they did. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1444.4s)]
*  They decided not to do. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1445.64s)]
*  And really what happened in four years under President Biden [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1447.16s)]
*  to Iran's nuclear program? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1450.52s)]
*  We end 2020 with Iran [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1453.24s)]
*  basically broke from an accessible foreign exchange reserve perspective. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1457.52s)]
*  Right on the verge of a balanced payments crisis. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1462.48s)]
*  They're running low on cash down to what their last four billion dollars [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1465.88s)]
*  of accessible foreign exchange reserves. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1470.24s)]
*  Right. Oil exports at oil. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  Exports, you know, that that's a moving target. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1474.2s)]
*  Let's call it 300 to 500 thousand barrels per day, which is mostly illicit. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1476.96s)]
*  Down from had gone down all the way to, let's say, 100,000, 150,000 [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1480.3600000000001s)]
*  at some point bounce a little bit back up. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1484.0s)]
*  Now, there is a covid impact going on. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1486.64s)]
*  Granted, you assume that as you come out of covid, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  there might be a little bit bump up. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1493.48s)]
*  But if you have active enforcement of sanctions and the Chinese still fear you [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1494.68s)]
*  and it's not bumping up that much. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1498.8400000000001s)]
*  This is this is where it's plateauing. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  By the way, a lot of it is illicit oil that we saw in press reports [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1502.96s)]
*  going to Syria with IRGC smuggling. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1506.48s)]
*  It wasn't the general. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1508.6000000000001s)]
*  But bottom line is the economy is on its back. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1510.52s)]
*  It's on its back. Right. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1512.8000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, so Lamai has been killed in the past year. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1514.2s)]
*  For Cresa Day has been killed in the past year. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1518.3600000000001s)]
*  You have not seen the program jump on the nuclear side [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1521.24s)]
*  throughout the year. Very interestingly. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1524.96s)]
*  Well, we go back to one of your previous questions. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1527.8000000000002s)]
*  In 2019, when President Trump [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1531.08s)]
*  halted oil sanctions, exceptions for countries that were importing Iranian oil [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1534.56s)]
*  and tried for the first time to drive Iranian exports towards zero and succeeded. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1539.6799999999998s)]
*  We saw the Iranians for the first time violate the JCPOA in response [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1545.6799999999998s)]
*  because they realize, oh, boy, this is not good. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1550.0s)]
*  This is going to be destabilizing. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  We have to do something. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1554.36s)]
*  We got to scare people in Washington and Europe. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1555.32s)]
*  And Jevaz, are you going to do his press tour? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1558.16s)]
*  And we'll see who can talk to President Trump and scare him enough into backing down. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1560.5600000000002s)]
*  So they start breaking slowly through the caps of how much they're [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1565.5600000000002s)]
*  enriching the stockpile and advanced centrifuges being rolled out. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1569.44s)]
*  Right. But incrementally, increment, small steps. Right. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  Once Soleimani was killed, a lot of people focus on, you know, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1576.76s)]
*  were there rocket attacks and what happened? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1579.6000000000001s)]
*  That's not actually President Trump's decision to kill Kassim Soleimani, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  who's formerly the head of the IRGC Quds Force. Right. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1585.76s)]
*  Probably Iran's most successful strategic battlefield commander, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1590.32s)]
*  probably the world's most notorious terrorist that no one had ever heard of. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1595.08s)]
*  President Bush refused to take him out. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1598.32s)]
*  President Obama refused to take him out. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1600.04s)]
*  President Trump decided to kill him. Right. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1602.2s)]
*  And this shocked the Iranian system. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1604.44s)]
*  And what was the response from the Iranians with respect to their nuclear escalation [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1606.72s)]
*  after they took out the supreme leader's most trusted advisor? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1610.6s)]
*  It froze where it was. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1615.04s)]
*  Because? They continued this low level enrichment, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1617.0s)]
*  incremental expansion of their low enriched uranium stockpile. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1620.68s)]
*  But why? I mean, you would think at that point, they did not jump. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1625.2s)]
*  They would massively escalate. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1627.6000000000001s)]
*  And they didn't escalate because? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1629.72s)]
*  The one thing I remember clearly is President Trump coming out. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1631.2s)]
*  Everybody was wondering, he did a press conference, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1635.64s)]
*  everybody was wondering, what is he going to do in response [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1637.72s)]
*  to the ballistic missile strike that the Iranians had, almost symbolically, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1639.64s)]
*  to respond to the Qasem Soleimani strike. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1643.4s)]
*  The first words out of President Trump's mouth were [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1647.96s)]
*  they will never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1651.4s)]
*  And I think people missed it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1654.24s)]
*  I didn't miss it. I thought it was very intentional. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1656.28s)]
*  And later he started talking about, you know, we have dozens of targets, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1659.64s)]
*  you know, if they try something, you know. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1662.96s)]
*  The message was pretty clear. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1666.6s)]
*  I'm willing to go after Soleimani. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1669.36s)]
*  You escalate on the nuclear program. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1670.76s)]
*  You threaten us. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1672.68s)]
*  We have your sites. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1674.44s)]
*  We know where they are. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1675.8s)]
*  We can destroy them and we will. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1677.0s)]
*  And my recollection at the time, they did not escalate. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1678.92s)]
*  They did not escalate to a point where they would trigger that red line. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1681.48s)]
*  Right. They didn't go to 20 percent high [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1685.28s)]
*  enriched uranium, they certainly go to 60 percent high enriched uranium. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1687.28s)]
*  They weren't caught making uranium metal, key components of a nuclear weapon. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1689.92s)]
*  They didn't throw the IAEA out of facilities or withhold videotapes. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1694.76s)]
*  Oh, you know, when they did all those things I just said, starting in 2021, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1700.44s)]
*  when Iran's on its knees and you and I wrote a piece and said, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1706.08s)]
*  please, please, please understand you are inheriting [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1711.32s)]
*  just a historic amount of leverage. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1715.36s)]
*  This advice to President Biden. Correct. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1718.2s)]
*  See how I go full circle here. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1720.44s)]
*  It takes a while to be kept back. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  And we said, don't squander this. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1725.08s)]
*  Add to it. Use it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1727.8799999999999s)]
*  Get everything that President Trump would have gotten out of it. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1729.52s)]
*  Surprise them. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  I know Joe Biden said he wants to go back to JCPOA during the campaign. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  It would be a disastrous idea. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  Do not signal that. Don't do. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1740.4s)]
*  Go harder on pressure. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1743.0s)]
*  Use the pressure. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1744.8799999999999s)]
*  Get all the concessions we can now. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1746.12s)]
*  They didn't do that. Right. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1749.96s)]
*  In effect, I mean, do do what they then promised they would do, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1751.4s)]
*  which is negotiate a longer, longer, stronger and stronger and broader deal. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1754.16s)]
*  But of course, negotiating a longer, stronger and broader deal requires [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1758.2s)]
*  leverage. And your point is they were diminishing leverage [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1761.3600000000001s)]
*  as they were demanding a better deal. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1764.2s)]
*  Now, my perspective on this is that they ended up with like a split personality [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1765.68s)]
*  where half the administration wanted to just go full, full out appeasement. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1772.08s)]
*  You know, let's be the first to go back to JCPOA. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1777.4s)]
*  That's what the Iranians are demanding. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1779.88s)]
*  And then they'll come back into compliance. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1781.48s)]
*  Let's just lift all the sanctions and show that we're there. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1782.92s)]
*  And the other half are like, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1786.0s)]
*  I think this is a lot of leverage and maybe we can get something out of it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1788.56s)]
*  So we'll say we want to go back to JCPOA. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1791.8799999999999s)]
*  We won't go heavily on enforcement, but we won't relieve any sanctions. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1794.56s)]
*  And you end up in this muddle. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1799.36s)]
*  And of course, they appointed [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1801.96s)]
*  like the appeaser in chief, in my view, and Rob Mallee to be the special envoy. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1803.8799999999999s)]
*  And every single and one of the Iranians doing response, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1809.96s)]
*  it's like so predictable. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1812.92s)]
*  It's just outrageously predictable. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1814.52s)]
*  In fact, it was predicted. We predict. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1817.1200000000001s)]
*  That's right. It is predictable. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1819.24s)]
*  We said, if you offer appeasement in response, they're going to escalate [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  because that's always what they do. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1824.64s)]
*  They push, push, push until they see if anything pushes back. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1826.8000000000002s)]
*  They sense American weakness. They escalate. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1829.72s)]
*  They feel American steel. They stop. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1831.88s)]
*  So so what do they do? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1834.04s)]
*  They go up to 20 percent in January during the transition. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1835.52s)]
*  Biden comes in, does nothing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1839.28s)]
*  So now we're going back to JCPOA. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1841.0s)]
*  We want to deal Kumbaya. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1842.6s)]
*  They go up to 60 percent. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1845.4399999999998s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1847.76s)]
*  We tell the Europeans, don't even center them at the IAEA. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1849.1599999999999s)]
*  Stop what you're doing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1853.04s)]
*  Appeasement across borders. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1854.28s)]
*  You know, tell them we love them. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1855.8s)]
*  We want to go back to JCPOA, Kumbaya. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1857.1599999999999s)]
*  They're found doing, you know, manufacturing uranium metal. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1859.8s)]
*  They're limiting IAEA access. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1863.52s)]
*  All these things. No consequences. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1865.48s)]
*  No economic consequences. Quite the opposite. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1868.6s)]
*  We start loosening restrictions. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1871.04s)]
*  You start seeing oil exports starting to rise in a very considerable way. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1872.36s)]
*  More than you would account for just some coming out of Covid boom, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1876.68s)]
*  like a very significant rise in exports that's due to non-enforcement of sanctions [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1880.04s)]
*  and the Chinese understanding they can get away with it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1883.76s)]
*  We're loosening bank accounts to pay for more things. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1887.76s)]
*  Humanitarian channels being loosened to have more transactions [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1890.36s)]
*  that could be under the cover of humanitarian trade. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1894.4s)]
*  But who's going to be opposed to humanitarian trade if we just call things [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1896.92s)]
*  humanitarian trade? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1899.6399999999999s)]
*  Now we're able to give you more things to run. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1900.9599999999998s)]
*  So these are the billions of dollars released in frozen oil funds. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1903.56s)]
*  Well, this is before that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1908.1599999999999s)]
*  This is just allowing them to make debt payments out of oil funds and do, you know, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  just just pay for things more and process more transactions [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1913.1999999999998s)]
*  than maybe otherwise wouldn't have been done under the Trump administration. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1917.1999999999998s)]
*  None of it works. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1921.04s)]
*  They try to do a mini deal. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1922.4399999999998s)]
*  The Russians helped them broker in 2021 into 2022. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1924.6799999999998s)]
*  An interim nuclear deal that falls apart [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1928.4399999999998s)]
*  right around the invasion of Ukraine, where the Russians sort of pulled a plug on it [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1932.36s)]
*  at the time. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1937.04s)]
*  They wait out a couple of months. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1938.76s)]
*  Oh, what's going to happen? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1940.6799999999998s)]
*  Hey, let's go. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1942.32s)]
*  You know, it's OK. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1943.08s)]
*  You're sending drones to to Russia now to use against our Ukrainian allies. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  We want to pay you for it, actually. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's do a worse deal than the JCPOA even. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  They go to the table in late summer in 2022 [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1953.9199999999998s)]
*  and offer the JCPOA minus, which is to say [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1957.6s)]
*  you can by this point, Iran has been racing forward in its nuclear [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1962.6s)]
*  enrichment capabilities and production of enriched uranium. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1968.4399999999998s)]
*  That the breakout timeline that we always talked about, right? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1975.36s)]
*  Breakout time, how long would it take for Iran to produce enough [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1979.28s)]
*  weapons grade uranium for one nuclear device had gone from, you know, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1984.7600000000002s)]
*  the year under JCPOA at this point, I think it was down to six months. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1989.64s)]
*  It was getting like a four to six months window. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1994.88s)]
*  I mean, today it's a long weekend, as we talked about. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1996.68s)]
*  But at the time, in 2022, it was still around six months. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=1999.2800000000002s)]
*  So we started seeing reports at the breakout time [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2003.48s)]
*  under the deal being offered by the Biden administration, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2006.8400000000001s)]
*  would be about six months. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2010.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, how is that possible? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2012.6s)]
*  The JCPOA was a year. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2014.32s)]
*  You're now saying there's a deal on the table for six months. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2016.48s)]
*  Yeah, because they weren't going to require a single centrifuge [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2018.56s)]
*  that had already been manufactured and deployed be dismantled. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2022.6s)]
*  They just let them put them in a locker for the time of the deal, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2026.32s)]
*  which means you have to account for that capability that's in storage. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2030.0s)]
*  They could still, if they wanted to break the seal, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  bring the centrifuge out, install them and in six months have your bomb, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2037.24s)]
*  at least or bombs worth of uranium, at least. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2042.0800000000002s)]
*  And then you say, oh, you know, we'll give you more sanctions relief [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  than you got under JCPOA. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2048.64s)]
*  All of the new sanctions that the Trump administration had put on [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2050.0s)]
*  after leaving the JCPOA, we'll take those off, too. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2054.08s)]
*  So now you're actually getting all the JCPOA sanctions relief plus. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2056.8s)]
*  Oh, there was a negotiation to remove the IRGC, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2061.56s)]
*  the Revolutionary Guard Corps from the terror. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2064.76s)]
*  You remember, Mark, we had a whole campaign on this to say. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2066.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2069.36s)]
*  Gold Star families were writing letters to President Biden. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2070.48s)]
*  Please don't do this. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2072.8s)]
*  Why would you take the IRGC off the tear? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2074.56s)]
*  Now, he relented on that under heavy pressure in congressional votes [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2076.52s)]
*  and Senate votes was pretty clear to him that he was going to pay a price [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2080.52s)]
*  in the Senate if he went there and took it off the table. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2083.84s)]
*  But they look, by the way, let's be honest, they also look for ways [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  to still give sanctions like to the IRGC on an economic sense. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2089.1600000000003s)]
*  And one of their largest conglomerates were going to get sanctions relief. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2092.36s)]
*  So it wasn't like they weren't giving IRGC sanctions relief in the deal. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2096.68s)]
*  Didn't matter. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2100.12s)]
*  They couldn't still go enough to the Iranians. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2101.6s)]
*  The Iranians said, wow, you're willing to give us all of this. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2104.0s)]
*  You're so desperate now after we're already sending drones to Russia. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2106.36s)]
*  And let's see what happens next time. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2109.92s)]
*  And the deal collapses late 2022. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2113.0s)]
*  They didn't get to a next time yet because what happened? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2116.92s)]
*  Massa Amini is killed by the morality police. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2120.04s)]
*  There is a national uprising in Iran. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2124.4s)]
*  And it's no longer politically correct [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2127.6000000000004s)]
*  for the president in a midterm election to give sanctions relief to Iran. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2130.96s)]
*  This is the women's life freedom uprising, right? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2134.0s)]
*  As it turns out, you can try to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2136.52s)]
*  You can plot assassinations and kidnappings on US soil, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2140.0s)]
*  which was going on for those first two years. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2143.84s)]
*  You talk about Iranian-Americans in a crazy, like movie-like plot [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2146.1200000000003s)]
*  of trying to kidnap somebody from New York. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2151.96s)]
*  Right. This is Marcy Elenajad. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2154.08s)]
*  Correct. Right. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2155.8s)]
*  We had already learned about the plots against Pompeo, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2157.16s)]
*  against Bolton and others. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2159.52s)]
*  There are indictments already. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2160.92s)]
*  I mean, it's none of that inhibits you from giving billions of dollars [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2162.0s)]
*  to the Islamic Republic. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2166.28s)]
*  But when women celebrities start going on social media, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2168.52s)]
*  standing with the Iranian people, then as you're nearing the midterm election [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2173.16s)]
*  2022, the White House realizes this might not be a good thing. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  We can't do this deal right now. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2181.8s)]
*  So they wait. The midterm passes. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2183.88s)]
*  You go into 2023. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2186.1600000000003s)]
*  They're looking around. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2189.04s)]
*  Is the national uprising still going on? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  Is Iranian women still fighting? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2191.92s)]
*  The protests got crushed. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2193.5600000000004s)]
*  Iranian women get killed, thrown in prison, raped, tortured. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2194.6800000000003s)]
*  They eventually break the back of women's life freedom [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2198.2000000000003s)]
*  by launching chemical weapon attacks against Iranian schoolgirls. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2200.5600000000004s)]
*  OK, so basically they break the back of this uprising. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  And now the space opens for more opportunities. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2209.76s)]
*  Correct. Now, they still kind of feel weird about doing a deal. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2212.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, the politics in Congress have completely shifted. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  That never that that fundamentally changed. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  Remember, there's a law that if a president does a nuclear deal with Iran, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2224.76s)]
*  it has to get submitted to the Congress. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2229.44s)]
*  And they get a month basically to look at it and maybe vote to disapprove it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2231.6000000000004s)]
*  That's getting disapproved in 2023 because of the Masami uprising. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2236.0s)]
*  No matter what you try to give Iran sanctions relief, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2239.8s)]
*  Congress is voting on a bipartisan basis to reject it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2243.04s)]
*  So they can't do a deal that gets submitted to the Congress. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2246.52s)]
*  So Brett McGurk, the time the Middle East coordinator for the NSC goes to Oman. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2250.96s)]
*  And you can see it charted out in the press reports. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2257.6s)]
*  Some sort of overture, something that's still not very public. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2261.04s)]
*  Where there's almost like a gentleman's agreement being offered. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2265.4s)]
*  We're going to find money. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2269.36s)]
*  We're going to relax sanctions. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2271.6s)]
*  And you're not going to go farther than you are today. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2273.84s)]
*  You're not going to go to weapons grade uranium. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2277.92s)]
*  You're not going to. And we'd like you to knock off [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2280.76s)]
*  some of the things you're doing with Russia, attacks on US forces in the Middle East. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2283.56s)]
*  That would be nice to. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2287.76s)]
*  Money starts materializing for access to the regime. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2289.76s)]
*  Ten billion dollars in Iraq that have been tied up under US sanctions for years [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2294.56s)]
*  suddenly becomes available, transferred to Oman, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2300.0s)]
*  available for what the Biden administration says humanitarian transaction purposes. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2303.4s)]
*  We do a hostage deal where we pay six billion dollars for five hostages in Iran. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2308.56s)]
*  Can you has ever been ever heard of that as a ransom? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2315.44s)]
*  It's crazy. Six billion dollars, one point two five billion dollars per person. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2317.72s)]
*  That's nuts. That's not a hostage deal. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2322.04s)]
*  That's a way of packaging more money moving for the regime's access. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2325.1600000000003s)]
*  And so money that had been trapped in South Korea under our sanctions, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2329.2400000000002s)]
*  oil revenue gets moved to accounts and cut her. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2332.08s)]
*  And over the summer of 2023, we see oil exports to China [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2336.04s)]
*  skyrocket to the moon, cannot be explained by sanctions evasion. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2341.48s)]
*  It is an active policy. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2346.6800000000003s)]
*  Clearly, with the consent of the United States government, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  we're talking crossing two million barrels per day at one point in August 2023. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2350.48s)]
*  Massive windfall there for the regime. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2355.7200000000003s)]
*  By the way, a great deal for the Chinese, too. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2357.6s)]
*  They're sucking up Russian oil cheap because of the way our sanctions were designed for Russia. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2359.6s)]
*  Now they're sucking up Iranian oil at discount because we're allowing them to do it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2364.2400000000002s)]
*  We're just basically filling their SPR. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2367.84s)]
*  I mean, what a crazy policy for the United States at this point on every level. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2370.0s)]
*  And and what happens within a few months? October 7th. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2375.2400000000002s)]
*  And we saw reports that Hamas's budget tripled in 2023. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  I wonder how that's possible. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2384.84s)]
*  Well, of course, if you start allowing all kinds of sanctions [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2386.6800000000003s)]
*  really for the regime, their budgets go up, their terror budgets go up, et cetera. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2389.44s)]
*  OK, I want to ask you now, I mean, I listen to certain I've been following [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2392.92s)]
*  events since October 7th. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  I think you've done a very eloquent critique of Obama administration, Iran policy, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2397.6400000000003s)]
*  Biden administration, Iran policy. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2403.04s)]
*  We are where we are today, which in some respects, it's a mixed place. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2404.7200000000003s)]
*  Right on the nuclear side, Iran's a threshold nuclear weapons power. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2409.08s)]
*  On the other hand, their so-called axis of resistance has taken a beating. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2412.4s)]
*  Thanks to the Israelis, who've really done severe damage to Hezbollah and to Hamas [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2416.2s)]
*  and to Iran's own strategic air defenses and and some weaponization activities. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2421.84s)]
*  So we are where we are today. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2428.44s)]
*  But here's the challenge, dear Rich, because again, easy for you and I. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2429.72s)]
*  And we've done it often and I hope eloquently to critique [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2433.52s)]
*  what has happened in the past. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2437.44s)]
*  But now we President Trump is in office. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2438.68s)]
*  He just put out a presidential memorandum to reinstate maximum pressure. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2441.88s)]
*  And we've seen some of that already taking place, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2447.12s)]
*  some of the enforcement actions under that. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2450.48s)]
*  So it's clear we're going to get more economic pressure, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2452.7200000000003s)]
*  hopefully a return to what President Trump did in first term Trump. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2454.96s)]
*  But he is facing a Iranian nuclear weapons program that is at the cusp. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2459.08s)]
*  So where do we go from here? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2464.8s)]
*  So I think there's several several things going on here. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2466.88s)]
*  Number one. This is still the same president who killed Qasem Soleimani. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2470.4s)]
*  Still the same president who talked about having all kinds of sites in Iran [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2477.36s)]
*  and that the regime was clearly afraid of crossing nuclear red lines. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2481.92s)]
*  It would be, I believe, a grave mistake for the regime to cross nuclear red lines, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2487.1600000000003s)]
*  believing that they think better, that they think this is a different president, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2492.84s)]
*  that maybe he won't act or something won't happen. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2497.6800000000003s)]
*  So there is a credible military threat, in my view, always attached [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  to President Trump being president, particularly towards the Iranians, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2505.56s)]
*  because he proved to them that he maintains a credible military threat [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2509.56s)]
*  if they cross red lines that he perceives to be a threat to the United States [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2513.6400000000003s)]
*  and our interests. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2517.92s)]
*  Plus. But let me stop you there. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2520.1600000000003s)]
*  But here's a big plus. Here's a big plus. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2522.52s)]
*  OK. Even if you said, oh, I'm not sure. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  Or if I'm in Tehran, I don't know. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2528.56s)]
*  I saw this news reports and I saw this leak and I saw the statement. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to assign a 30 percent chance, a 20 percent chance [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2536.52s)]
*  that maybe he would use force. OK. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2541.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't speak for the president. I speak for the White House. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2544.08s)]
*  This is my own view analysis. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  They have no strategic air defense today. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2548.88s)]
*  You've taken that chance. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2551.36s)]
*  You're really going to take that chance, either with the Israelis [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2553.6000000000004s)]
*  or the United States, you're going to cross red lines. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2556.0s)]
*  And by the way, not just nuclear red lines, other red lines, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2557.96s)]
*  knowing that you have no strategic air defense, the Israelis have wiped it out. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2560.92s)]
*  And clearly, you can try to get the Russians to replace the system. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2564.36s)]
*  You can try to remanufacture one of your knockoffs of the Russian systems. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  The Israelis clearly have shown they can just take it out again. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2572.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2576.0400000000004s)]
*  That seems like a high risk calculation for the supreme leader. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2576.84s)]
*  Now, maybe he maybe would pay a price. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2580.36s)]
*  We'll see. Can't predict the future. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2582.6400000000003s)]
*  But you have to have a credible military threat in the back. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2585.6000000000004s)]
*  You don't have to talk about it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2588.8s)]

*  It doesn't have to be what you lead with. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2591.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. I mean, the idea of speak softly and carry a big stick, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2594.36s)]
*  I think actually is appropriate and actually is sort of how I see [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2597.7200000000003s)]
*  President Trump speak about things and how he's going to do it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2602.04s)]
*  Trump speak about things and conduct himself. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2605.44s)]
*  He can say he would like to have a good relationship with Iran. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2608.96s)]
*  That's appropriate. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2612.76s)]
*  We should want to have a good relationship with Iran. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2613.56s)]

*  It's crazy. It's unnatural. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2620.08s)]
*  The people of Iran are pro-American. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2621.7200000000003s)]
*  We know that. We should. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2624.08s)]

*  Their regime is completely detached from normalcy. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2628.0s)]

*  We should aspire to that. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2647.8s)]

*  while threatening that they could be a nuclear weapon power, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2685.0s)]
*  I can't allow that to happen. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2687.08s)]

*  And by the way, God forbid, they actually got the weapon [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2698.2400000000002s)]
*  with long range missiles. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2701.32s)]

*  I mean, we're using all the tools of economic coercion here [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2764.1600000000003s)]
*  to try to recreate on steroids [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2767.44s)]
*  the trajectory we were at 2019, 2020. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2771.4s)]
*  By the way, that's going to take a little bit, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  but it's already having an impact. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2776.28s)]
*  I mean, the minute he signed that order, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2778.4s)]
*  you saw the real start to crater. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2782.0s)]
*  Now, it needs to be a constant campaign. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2785.5200000000004s)]
*  You and I know this about sanctions, right? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2788.6000000000004s)]
*  It a lot of this is narrative economics, a lot of it's psychological to the market, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2791.2000000000003s)]
*  but also actual action and concrete action. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2795.88s)]
*  Non enforcement is sanctions relief. We know that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2798.88s)]
*  And if you have every couple of weeks something happening, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2802.16s)]
*  a warning to the market, a sanctions target, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2805.04s)]
*  real action taken against the Chinese and looking at [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2809.64s)]
*  who are the state on enterprises in China that might be one or two steps removed [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  from the entities that they think we can't get to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2817.96s)]
*  that are actually involved in the import of all this illicit cargo. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2821.04s)]
*  You start creating real, real crushing pressure on them. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2824.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, Rich, I would add, I mean, it's very interesting that, you know, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2828.7999999999997s)]
*  you talked about the real the Iranian currency and the real dollar exchange rate [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2831.32s)]
*  even the Islamic Revolution, 1979, 46 years ago, 70 to one. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2835.6400000000003s)]
*  After JCPOA 2015, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2840.56s)]
*  I remember roughly around 35000, 38000 to one. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2843.88s)]
*  It is now approaching a million to one. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2849.4s)]
*  It is it is remarkable. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2852.52s)]
*  And that is, as you say, it's an expectation from the currency market [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2854.32s)]
*  that more and more pressure is to come. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2858.76s)]
*  So the regime is facing this economic pressure. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2861.4s)]
*  They are seeing their currency meltdown. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2864.1600000000003s)]
*  And now they're going to do what the regime always does, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2866.88s)]
*  which is they believe they can rope a dope President Trump [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2870.04s)]
*  the way they rope a dope many American presidents, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2872.76s)]
*  pull them into negotiations, prolong those negotiations. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2875.6000000000004s)]
*  And in doing so, relieve the economic pressure, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2879.88s)]
*  get some kind of deal. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2883.6800000000003s)]
*  JCPOA plus agree to some temporary restrictions. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2885.56s)]
*  President Trump calls it the greatest deal ever negotiated. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2889.8s)]
*  This time around, he submits it to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2893.1200000000003s)]
*  Republicans line up, as they often do, in favor of President Trump's initiatives. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2898.48s)]
*  So he gets 53 Republicans, 14 Democrats decide to join Republicans [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2902.88s)]
*  because they'd rather have this deal than than war. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2908.4s)]
*  So 67, 70 senators ratify the deal. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2912.1200000000003s)]
*  It's a treaty with Iran. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2915.52s)]
*  Now Iran has a treaty much more difficult to withdraw from a treaty [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2917.68s)]
*  than from an executive agreement. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2921.16s)]
*  Iran gets massive sanctions relief. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2923.04s)]
*  The Iranian nuclear crisis ends. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2926.24s)]
*  Iranians wait out President Trump in four years time. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2928.96s)]
*  They hope they'll get a Democrat who's not willing to use American power [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2931.6s)]
*  or they get an isolationist Republican who doesn't want to confront Iran. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2935.72s)]
*  Game, set, match. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2939.6s)]
*  Iran, Israel is done. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2941.68s)]
*  Israel's military option is over. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2944.2s)]
*  And Israel will now face a richer, empowered Iran [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2946.48s)]
*  that, again, is going to just take patient pathways to nuclear weapons [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2952.6s)]
*  and wait till whatever restrictions are put in place disappear. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2956.44s)]
*  I worry about that scenario. Do you? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2961.44s)]
*  I don't. Good. I don't. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2964.2s)]
*  There's a lot of straw man built into that hypothetical, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2967.16s)]
*  starting with the fact that I don't think Donald Trump is naive or stupid. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2971.0s)]
*  And I think he's pretty clear eyed about what the Iranians [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2975.4s)]
*  would want to get out of a negotiation and what the bottom lines are [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2979.88s)]
*  for what a good deal, whatever that might be. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2983.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's go there. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2987.12s)]
*  What what is a good deal look like in your eyes? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2988.32s)]
*  Like, what are the bottom lines with respect to in the nuclear [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2990.4s)]
*  in the nuclear realm? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2993.52s)]
*  So I go back to my criticism of JCPOA. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2995.08s)]
*  I think this is and remember, this is a deal that the president has called [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=2997.88s)]
*  the worst deal ever. Right. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3001.64s)]
*  I mean, he believes that he says it over and over again, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3004.44s)]
*  one of the worst deals ever made. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3007.04s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3009.28s)]
*  What did I say the two clear deficiencies, fatal flaws of the deal were? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3011.4s)]
*  Verification, verification, dismantlement and dismantlement. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3016.64s)]
*  OK, I would start number one by saying to the Iranians today, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3019.56s)]
*  if they were to try to use all their influence operations [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3025.04s)]
*  and all their networks and their people say, oh, they want a deal, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3029.04s)]
*  they want to do a deal and you're afraid of them snookering you [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3032.76s)]
*  into some terrible deal, there is an easy way to know if you're serious. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3035.92s)]
*  Provide us information about your program. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3041.28s)]
*  Here is the list of things that we need from you to have a serious negotiation. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3043.92s)]
*  You need to declare all the aspects of your past [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3048.36s)]
*  nuclear weapons activities, all your sites, up front, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3051.7200000000003s)]
*  up front where material is today, stockpiles, nuclear [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3054.96s)]
*  capable missile stockpiles. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3059.16s)]
*  You know, tell us more about SPND. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3061.12s)]
*  We want a full understanding of all this. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3063.2799999999997s)]
*  We want a full picture of what you have to negotiate over. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3064.88s)]
*  And then we want to verify it, right, because you can't just like say, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3069.3199999999997s)]
*  oh, yeah, no problem. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3073.0s)]
*  Here's our program, right. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3074.3599999999997s)]
*  Some like piece of paper that the Iranians scribbled out. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3075.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, oh, OK, so full disclosure on the program up front. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3077.52s)]
*  OK, OK. And then I'm already fundamentally a massive change [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3081.0s)]
*  in behavior by the regime if they were to do that. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3085.6s)]
*  If you could verify the full declaration, a complete declaration of their program. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3088.2s)]
*  You would at the very least, first of all, have tons more information [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3095.8399999999997s)]
*  about their program eyes into the program in areas that we've never visited before. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3100.16s)]
*  It would have to include military sites, right, and have IAEA personnel [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3104.8799999999997s)]
*  go to those sites to verify what's in the document. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3108.56s)]
*  And then at that point, you can then say, OK, step two, dismantle it. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3112.0s)]
*  You don't get to just have a turnkey nuclear weapons program [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3119.2s)]
*  for the day of your choosing in the future. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3122.8799999999997s)]
*  They do two of those basically a lot of details there, you know, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3125.3199999999997s)]
*  but but at a fundamental high level, you do those two things. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3130.2s)]
*  You have removed the existential danger. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3135.56s)]
*  And people will say to you, which we totally agree with you. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3138.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, full verification, full transparency on the nuclear program, full dismantlement. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3142.68s)]
*  I mean, take this program down to where it used to be under international law [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3147.72s)]
*  when there were multiple UN Security Council resolutions, right, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3152.12s)]
*  requiring the end of enrichment, right, which, by the way, is one of the requirements [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3154.8799999999997s)]
*  in the order from President Trump is for the UN ambassador, at least the phonic, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3159.6s)]
*  to work with our partners to snap back the UN sanctions as well, which would, by the way, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3165.3999999999996s)]
*  restore prior UN Security Council resolutions that order Iran to halt all enrichment activities. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3169.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. OK. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3175.4399999999996s)]
*  So we all agree that's where we need to be. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3176.6s)]
*  We also have been tracking this issue for two decades, tracking the Iranians, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3180.24s)]
*  tracking their negotiators. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3184.4s)]
*  And let's say for the sake of argument that that is a fantasy that Iran says, absolutely not. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3186.2799999999997s)]
*  You're not getting into our military sites. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3192.2799999999997s)]
*  You're not learning about our program. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3194.3199999999997s)]
*  You're not interviewing our weapons scientists. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3196.2799999999997s)]
*  And if you we are absolutely not dismantling our program. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3197.92s)]
*  We have built this program. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3201.24s)]
*  We've invested tens of billions of dollars in this program, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3202.64s)]
*  both in direct investment and the costs we've paid. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3205.32s)]
*  We need this for our national security. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3209.1200000000003s)]
*  We need it for civilian energy. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3210.88s)]
*  There is no way we are going to dismantle this program. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3212.76s)]
*  So either you do a deal with us short of that, way short of that, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3215.28s)]
*  or we are a threshold nuclear power and a long weekend we're going to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3220.96s)]
*  What does President Trump do? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3226.76s)]
*  I think if you actually read what he's saying here, here are the words that he's already stating. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3228.6400000000003s)]
*  He's answering your question. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3235.24s)]
*  He has said, I don't want to have military conflict. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3237.12s)]
*  I don't want to be bombing Iran. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3241.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't I don't want to have this confrontation. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3243.0s)]
*  We should have a deal where you have a verified nuclear peace agreement, he calls it. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3244.6s)]
*  I see that as being something that is verifiable, full declaration, fully verified. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3250.96s)]
*  We have that and dismantlement. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3256.56s)]
*  So the threat does not exist now or in the future. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3259.04s)]
*  Because remember, go back to the policy statement in the NSPM, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3262.32s)]
*  nuclear weapons and extortion and the nuclear extortion racket. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. How do you end the nuclear extortion racket? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3271.0400000000004s)]
*  Those two elements take care of that. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3273.44s)]
*  That nuclear threshold concern, which is a permanent extortion, is removed. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3275.8s)]
*  I don't want to do that. I want a deal. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3281.76s)]
*  And then he says, interestingly, and I think if we have this deal, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3283.28s)]
*  the risk of an Israeli military attack would be dramatically reduced, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3289.64s)]
*  which is sort of the nicer way of saying, if you don't do this deal, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3294.8799999999997s)]
*  maybe there will be a military strike. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3301.3599999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's by Israel in the future. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3303.56s)]
*  Now, maybe it's by the United States, too. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3306.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a decision for the president and something that the regime can't discount. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3308.3599999999997s)]
*  But he's not removing a military threat. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3313.12s)]
*  He's not saying he's not going to back Israel potentially in the future [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3317.64s)]
*  with a military threat. He is leading with diplomacy. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3321.44s)]
*  He's leading with pressure. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3325.04s)]
*  And he's saying you cannot be a nuclear threshold state. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3327.24s)]
*  Now, there's other elements here, right? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3333.64s)]
*  The sponsorship of terrorism, proliferation of missiles, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3335.2s)]
*  assassination plots and all that. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3340.44s)]
*  They are addressed in his order as the malign activity [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3342.88s)]
*  that we're still addressing. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3346.08s)]
*  And listen, let's say there's another scenario here, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3347.92s)]
*  which is that they don't negotiate and they don't cross a red line. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3352.96s)]
*  They just sort of try to stay in the status quo for four years, right? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3357.3199999999997s)]
*  Because there is a four year clock. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3361.12s)]
*  Or what the Iranians do, which is what they've done for 20 years. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3363.72s)]
*  They appreciate that the US red line today is 90 percent [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3366.44s)]
*  in rich uranium, weapons grade uranium, as you've described. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3371.52s)]
*  But I don't know that that is true anymore. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3376.0s)]
*  That might have been under Biden, Joe Biden's red line, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3378.24s)]
*  famously made completely inane by saying the reason why we won't snap back [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3382.56s)]
*  UN sanctions because they might go to weapons grade uranium, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3388.0s)]
*  which means, by the way, it's not even a military red line. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3392.16s)]
*  It was a political red line at that point. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3394.24s)]
*  So I don't even know 90 percent was actually fair enough. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3395.92s)]
*  But when you look at the policy, you look at the president's statement, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3399.16s)]
*  you look at the language between he and the prime minister [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3403.92s)]
*  and the way he answered questions about what he supported in Israeli. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3406.96s)]
*  Again, I don't speak for him. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3410.16s)]
*  I'm not putting words in his mouth or the White House's mouth. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3412.96s)]
*  They speak for themselves. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3415.08s)]
*  But I see a dynamic where you don't know what the really they're working [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3416.76s)]
*  on weaponization right now, they're doing computer modeling. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3422.32s)]
*  Who's to say that's not a red line at some point? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3424.96s)]
*  Who's to say that more construction at an underground facility [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3427.28s)]
*  that could be where they go to move and break out isn't a red line? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3431.6s)]
*  You know, why is 90? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3436.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, one of the things I think we need to agree on, as I've said [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  at the beginning, we should concede the fact that they already have the 90 [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3440.3999999999996s)]
*  percent capability. They've proven it to us. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3445.0s)]
*  You're waiting for them to produce 90 percent. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3448.0s)]
*  You're just waiting for them to be at the breakout [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3450.3199999999997s)]
*  because they can get all the way there right before they go to 90 percent. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3453.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're as you said, they're 97 percent of what they need [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3456.2s)]
*  technically to get to weapons grade uranium. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3459.32s)]
*  So they effectively are there. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3461.4s)]
*  So the red lines can't be that last step, right? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3462.8s)]
*  Which might be the hardest to prevent at that point. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3465.44s)]
*  It has to be something before then. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3468.44s)]
*  But then the regime's game is to build redundancy, right? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3470.28s)]
*  It's to build, as you say, additional enrichment facilities even deeper underground. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3474.48s)]
*  It's to build even more advanced centrifuges, next generation centrifuges [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3478.44s)]
*  that can enrich uranium even faster is to build up their stockpiles [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3482.84s)]
*  of enriched material and actually bury that in deep tunnels underground [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3486.84s)]
*  in places like Isfahan. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3491.0s)]
*  It's to have the weapon scientists working on warhead design [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3493.12s)]
*  but doing it in a way where they can pretend that there's some dual use [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3497.96s)]
*  civilian purpose for this, right? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3501.32s)]
*  And create a big debate between the US and Israeli intelligence community over [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3503.04s)]
*  are they really working on weaponization or not? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3507.44s)]
*  I mean, this this is the game. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3510.16s)]
*  This is exactly how they played it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3512.0s)]
*  By the way, going three years of not having eyes at a centrifuge [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3514.6s)]
*  manufacturing plant is crazy. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3517.64s)]
*  Right. That's a crisis every single day that goes on. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3519.96s)]
*  Right. So the question is, where is this administration going to set its red line? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3521.96s)]
*  And the second question from you may want to answer this or not. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3526.08s)]
*  I mean, I'm of the view that we have a sort of a bit of a mismatch [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3529.48s)]
*  and we've had it for many years. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3533.88s)]
*  The Israelis have the will to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3535.64s)]
*  The Israelis have impressive capabilities, but limited compared to ours. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3539.56s)]
*  We have impressive capabilities, but the radiance have always questioned our will. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3545.16s)]
*  So I think if you're going to actually walk into a negotiation [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3550.4s)]
*  where you're going to insist on full verification, full disclosure and full [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3554.48s)]
*  dismantlement, then you have to give the Israelis the capabilities to match their will. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3558.48s)]
*  And there, you know, what I'd like to see as one example [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3563.48s)]
*  is have Israeli pilots go to Missouri, get trained up on our B-2 bombers [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3567.16s)]
*  that carry these massive ordnance penetrators. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3571.88s)]
*  There are 30,000 pound bombs that are capable of destroying these [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3574.52s)]
*  deeply buried underground facilities and essentially put them in the plains [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3577.92s)]
*  and then start the negotiation and say to the Iranian supreme leader [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3583.0s)]
*  and his lackeys, I am serious about a verifiable peace deal. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3587.24s)]
*  I am serious about a verifiable nuclear deal. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3592.52s)]
*  I want to make Iran great again. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3595.44s)]
*  But if you don't, you don't comply, then the Israelis now have everything they need. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3597.7599999999998s)]
*  They have the will. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3603.0s)]
*  They've clearly demonstrated that. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3604.4s)]
*  And now they have all the capabilities to destroy your nuclear program. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3605.96s)]
*  So that's your choice. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3609.7200000000003s)]
*  And by the way, when the Israelis are going in to destroy your nuclear program, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3610.92s)]
*  they may go after other leadership assets. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3614.4s)]
*  They may go after economic assets. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3617.2s)]
*  At the end of the day, you may be left without a nuclear program and a regime. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3619.2400000000002s)]
*  Now let's negotiate. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3623.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, I think that they clearly [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3625.7200000000003s)]
*  know that President Trump has the will. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3629.76s)]
*  If they don't, it's a miscalculation. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3632.28s)]
*  They know we have the capability. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  They know Israel has the will. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3637.2000000000003s)]
*  I think they're not sure if Israel has the capability. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3639.0400000000004s)]
*  And we built into to all of this is the assumption that maybe they don't. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3642.5600000000004s)]
*  And that's why we need to give them more capability. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3647.76s)]
*  I actually think that's sometimes an assumption that works against us [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3650.0400000000004s)]
*  and against the Israelis. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3652.88s)]
*  They've shown us an amazing amount of technological creativity, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3654.36s)]
*  operational creativity in how they already responded inside of Iran twice. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3658.56s)]
*  Once that wiped out their air defense and other critical assets. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3665.7599999999998s)]
*  So I don't know that it's the right assumption [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3670.24s)]
*  that they couldn't do something today. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3673.04s)]
*  But as you say, I think it's also helpful for us to make sure our ally [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3675.7999999999997s)]
*  has everything it needs to make sure it can. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3679.88s)]
*  If it deems it in its existential [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3683.0s)]
*  right to exist and ability to exist and to take out a threat like the Iranian nuclear program, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3686.28s)]
*  that's that's a force multiplier for us to have an ally like Israel [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3691.88s)]
*  with the capabilities and the will to take out major threats. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3695.92s)]
*  That's right. I want to end with that. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3699.52s)]
*  Again, I think if President Trump wants a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear crisis, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3701.64s)]
*  if he wants a deal that will permanently prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3706.92s)]
*  then it's a question of leverage, economic leverage, economic pressure, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3712.64s)]
*  the credible threat of military power, both American and Israeli. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3717.44s)]
*  Rich, thank you for your tour de force on Iran's nuclear program. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3721.6s)]
*  We're going to be coming back to you. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3725.44s)]
*  I think this is going to be a fascinating year. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3726.64s)]
*  I think 2025 will be the Iran year where big decisions will be made [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3728.64s)]
*  and no one knows is better than you do. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  So thanks for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you again. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3735.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3738.12s)]
*  Big thanks to Rich for delivering an expert, no nonsense breakdown of Iran's nuclear ambitions [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3739.8s)]
*  and a clear eyed assessment of how U.S. policy can actually stop the regime in its tracks. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3744.5600000000004s)]
*  As Rich laid out, the clock is ticking. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3749.44s)]
*  If you want to hold Iran's sprint to the bomb, we need to bring back maximum pressure, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3751.7200000000003s)]
*  the suffocating economic sanctions, the credible military threat [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3755.8s)]
*  and zero tolerance for reeling in stonewall. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3758.84s)]
*  No concessions, no half measures, full transparency, full dismantlement. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3761.2000000000003s)]
*  Anything less isn't a strategy, it's surrender. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm Mark Dubowitz and this has been the Iran Breakdown. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3769.28s)]
*  Thanks for listening and I'll see you next time when we break it down again. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZueaB27hZE&t=3772.1600000000003s)]
