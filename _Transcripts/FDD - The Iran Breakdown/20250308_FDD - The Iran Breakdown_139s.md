*ABOUT*
Tehran’s fingerprints are on some of the most critical challenges that the world grapples with today. Because its illicit activity spans the globe, the Islamic Republic dominates international headlines. From exporting terrorism and racing for the nuclear bomb to brutal human rights violations, news on Iran is often dark and convoluted.
Further widening this information gap, many consequential stories from inside Iran—like the regime’s decaying legitimacy and the restless population’s insatiable hunger for freedom— don’t always make it out of Iran. That has regime fingerprints on it, too.
The international community’s conflicting views on ‘the Iran threat’ also muddy the water.
To make it make sense, Mark sits down with some of the top voices on Iran to unpack and explore the fundamental dynamics that shape it. In 10 episodes of The Iran Breakdown, viewers and listeners will build a sturdy foundation for responsible Iran-watching.
