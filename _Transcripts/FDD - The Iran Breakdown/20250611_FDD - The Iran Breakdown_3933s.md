Video Description: Mehdi Yahyanejad was raised in the Islamic Republic. Now, he's fighting it from the outside... with code. From founding the digital platform that helped power Iran’s Green Movement in 2009 to coordinating resistance through online activism, Mehdi has seen firsthand how technology empowers dissidents and fuels regime resistance. As the Islamic Republic faces external challenges coupled with internal decay, the regime is cracking. Mehdi and Mark discuss how the right digital tools can help the Iranian people finish the job.

**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY)
*  It would crack down, it would kill people, it would make people disappear as long as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=0.0s)]
*  it could manage the propaganda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=5.3s)]

*  I'm Mark Dubois. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=19.72s)]
*  If you want to understand how the Islamic Republic survives and how it might finally [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=20.72s)]
*  fall, you need to understand the digital underground. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=24.48s)]
*  My guest today is Mehdi Yanyajad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=28.0s)]
*  He's an Iran-braised, MIT-trained physicist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=29.84s)]
*  He's a tech entrepreneur and dissident who's built platforms that punch far above their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=32.72s)]
*  weight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=37.36s)]

*  We talk about the regime's ideology and why it's collapsing, how activists are fighting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=51.08s)]
*  a digital war against Tehran's censors and repressors, and how artificial intelligence, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=54.88s)]
*  yes, AI, could help take down one of the world's most repressive regimes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=59.68s)]
*  Let's break it down. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  All right, Mehdi, welcome. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  It's wonderful to have you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for inviting me to your podcast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm introducing actually a new feature to my podcast, which is we usually give our [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  guests only water, but today I'm going to give you some whiskey. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=77.88s)]
*  No, I definitely appreciate it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=80.48s)]
*  I've learned that he helps me to come up with better ideas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=81.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk about the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  As we say at FTD, if we don't drink, the Islamic Republic wins. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=95.0s)]
*  I really want to start at the beginning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=96.0s)]
*  You have an amazing life story. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=97.0s)]
*  Your father was in the Shah's army. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=99.6s)]
*  I think like many Iranians, he hoped the revolution would bring freedom. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=102.16s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about your dad, about your family, but also you were raised in Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=109.08s)]
*  You were educated in Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=115.48s)]
*  You left when you were in your 20s, I believe. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=117.12s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=119.12s)]
*  You came to the United States, you trained at MIT. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=120.12s)]
*  We're going to get all into that, but I want to ask you from your father's perspective, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=122.88s)]
*  when did he realize that this freedom revolution, this Iranian revolution was really an Islamist [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=129.16s)]
*  revolution and that it had really been hijacked by the regime's thugs? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=139.16s)]
*  My father, back in the 70s, he was part of the Iranian army. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=140.16s)]
*  Of course, like a lot of other officers, he was trained during the Shah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=147.88s)]
*  It was a professional army where they were very disciplined. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=156.76s)]
*  They were dedicated to Iran as a nation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=160.0s)]
*  They were very patriotic and they wanted to see freedom, democracy in Iran. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=165.16s)]
*  Back then, of course, a lot of Iranians had good feelings about Islam. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=172.84s)]
*  They didn't know what Islamic fundamentalism is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=176.72s)]
*  They just thought that maybe the Islam they were practicing, they had a positive feeling [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=182.2s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=188.56s)]
*  A lot of people in the army, similar to my dad, were not necessarily happy with what [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=190.44s)]
*  was going on for various reasons. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=197.28s)]
*  Mostly because of lack of democracy and freedom and what they perceived to be a Shah as a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=202.68s)]
*  puppet. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=213.32s)]
*  Looking back at the history, we know he was not a real puppet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=214.32s)]
*  He had a lot of like, he was trying to make Iran stronger and so on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=220.32s)]
*  But that's how the perception was back then. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=224.76s)]
*  Through my father's experience, I saw how the Shah Rajiv fell and how the army crumbled [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  and how the Iranian army didn't protect the Shah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=238.4s)]
*  For example, my dad and some of his colleagues, they had promised to each other that if the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=242.88s)]
*  Shah would order the Iranian army to shoot people, shoot at protesters, they would defect [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=250.24s)]
*  the army. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=257.04s)]
*  But the Shah, of course, never did and that never happened. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=258.04s)]
*  My dad pretty much was sympathetic to the revolutionaries. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=264.4s)]
*  Very quickly, he realized that this is not the revolution they were looking for and the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=269.64s)]
*  Islamic fundamentalism is a beast that caught them by surprise. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Khomeini was really adept at this, wasn't he? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=283.88s)]
*  At really deceiving the Iranian left, Iranian women, people who were really trying to bring [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=287.28s)]
*  freedom and democracy and greater civil rights to Iran. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=295.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=300.04s)]
*  And Khomeini was very good at actually co-opting them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=301.04s)]
*  He was very good at co-opting them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=305.56s)]
*  He was also co-opted, I mean, he co-opted, of course, the love people who were for freedom [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=307.76s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=314.0s)]
*  He also, of course, take advantage of all the opportunists who joined his movement. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=315.0s)]
*  I mean, I asked my dad, what was the time that you realized this revolution is not going [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=320.6s)]
*  to get anywhere? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=325.24s)]
*  He said, actually, I saw the sign the very first day after the revolution. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=326.24s)]
*  That was the day the army accepted, basically, surrender to the people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=330.48s)]
*  And my dad was joyful and he thought that this is now the first day of freedom in Iran [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=336.52s)]
*  and so on. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=344.32s)]
*  And he was going to the base, army base. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=345.32s)]
*  And on the way to the army base, he saw one of the officers who was the most one of the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=348.96s)]
*  most abusive officers in the army against the revolutionaries before the fall of the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=354.92s)]
*  Shah's regime. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=363.28s)]
*  And he saw him on a back of a motorbike with Khomeini's picture and driving on the streets [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  of the city. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=375.28s)]
*  Basically, the guy has overnight switched from totally being an abusive officer to a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=377.44s)]
*  poor Khomeini dedicated person and riding on the back of a motorcycle was a no-no for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  a disciplined officer in a Shah's army. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=393.44s)]
*  But the key was he was an opportunist, but he had been very abusive and he certainly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=396.08s)]
*  was going to be very abusive as now one of the henchmen of Khomeini. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=403.96s)]
*  So Khomeini was able to basically recruit a lot of these opportunists at the time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=404.96s)]
*  And the next few years, he cracked down a lot of factions who supported the revolution [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  and brought victory for the revolution. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  And we know the history, so basically the fundamentalist Islam became the main component [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=425.52s)]
*  of this regime and they started exporting it throughout the Middle East and all the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=432.0s)]
*  things that, I mean, to Lebanon, to Iraq, to Syria, and so on, to Yemen. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  So a lot of these things came as a surprise to a lot of people who back then were hoping [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=443.24s)]
*  for something. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=450.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=451.8s)]
*  Well, we had Roya Hakakian on our show recently and she said the same thing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=452.8s)]
*  I mean, she was a teenage girl who lived through the Islamist revolution and it was the same [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=455.76s)]
*  thing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=461.72s)]
*  They really saw it in the beginning as this opportunity for hope and for freedom and for [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=462.72s)]
*  the lifting of censorship. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  And she's a poet, she's an author, she loves books. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  And she thought all of a sudden, now these are the books that I can read. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the darkness of the Islamic revolution descended on her and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  her family and they fled. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=480.68s)]
*  I want to ask you about your life early in Iran. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=482.92s)]
*  I mean, you studied at Sharif University, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=485.68s)]
*  Iran's top technology university, kind of Iran's MIT. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=489.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=493.96s)]
*  Did your first degree there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=494.96s)]
*  And then you went to, actually went to MIT. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=496.88s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that story. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=501.52s)]
*  How did you get from Iran to Cambridge, Massachusetts? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  How did you get to MIT? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=508.08s)]
*  And tell us also a little bit about what changed for you when you got to the US, you left the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=510.28s)]
*  Islamic Republic, you come to the United States of America during your early 20s. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=515.28s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=519.8s)]
*  So when I was growing up in Iran, we were at a time that there was no freedom of press, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=520.8s)]
*  there was no internet. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=528.68s)]
*  We actually were kind of blind to all the abuses that the Iranian government has created. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=530.68s)]
*  I mean, there was, for example, in the 80s, they killed a few thousand prisoners and international [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=539.72s)]
*  community didn't know much about it at that time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=548.28s)]
*  People in Iran didn't know about it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=550.92s)]
*  We didn't know about it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=553.28s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know about it until I left Iran. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=554.28s)]
*  So we were living in dark pretty much. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  And it was, I mean, I left at a time that Rafsanjani was still president in Iran. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=561.24s)]
*  So what year was this? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=568.28s)]
*  It was 1997, I guess, and I said it was right before Khatami got elected. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=569.28s)]
*  So that was, I mean, I saw the only experience of dissent I witnessed was once one of the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=575.8s)]
*  student groups had a sit-in and some of the Basiji militias, they tried to break it up [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  and so on. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=592.68s)]
*  So I kind of like, I mean, I saw it firsthand, but still it was just one incident in four [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=593.68s)]
*  years that I... [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=600.12s)]
*  So the student protests, as I recall, please correct me if I'm wrong, were more in the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=601.12s)]
*  late 1990s. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=605.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=606.48s)]
*  1999 or so. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=607.48s)]
*  They started back, yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=608.48s)]
*  So the first biggest incident was in 1999, so two years after I left Iran. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=609.48s)]
*  But what happened was, of course, there was that two years of free press that was not [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=615.12s)]
*  completely free press, but the comparison to what was going on before, it was huge early [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=622.12s)]
*  on during Khatami's presidency before, of course, the regime totally cracked down and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=629.44s)]
*  shut down all the newspapers and so on. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=638.72s)]
*  But then I came also, I mean, I came to Boston. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=641.0s)]
*  It was just getting exposed to American free media. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  How did, I mean, you're young Iranian, you're at Sharif University. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=647.4000000000001s)]
*  You can apply freely to MIT? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=651.6400000000001s)]
*  It was very hard. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=654.24s)]
*  Not that many people, of course, got in back then. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=655.48s)]
*  We were pretty much probably the first generation of... [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=658.2s)]
*  There was a big gap in immigration from Iran. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=662.5200000000001s)]
*  So from 79, when a lot of people left Iran, to late 90s, when we came as the first generation [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=665.1600000000001s)]
*  of Iranian students from Iran who were able to get into American universities. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=676.96s)]
*  I went to Turkey to take GRE exam, which helped us to get in and so on. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=684.56s)]
*  I mean, we had to go on a bus for 36 hours or something to get to Istanbul because the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=691.16s)]
*  exam wasn't happening in Iran or TOEFL exam and so on. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=697.68s)]
*  But we had solid, I would say, education in Iran. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=701.8s)]
*  I was part of the physics Olympiad team in Iran. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  Then I think after pretty much our first generation, more Iranian students came to the US and came [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=713.28s)]
*  to Canada and so on. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=721.04s)]
*  Of course, a lot of people who were not happy with what was going on in Iran, that was a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=722.96s)]
*  major reason a lot of people left. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=728.92s)]
*  Obviously, you need entry visas to get in the United States. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=730.92s)]
*  Did you need exit visas? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=733.64s)]
*  Did you need permission from the regime to leave and go to school? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=734.64s)]
*  No, you didn't have to get the permission. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=737.48s)]
*  Did the regime come to you and say, hey, Mehdi, you're going to MIT, it's great, lots of opportunity, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=739.6400000000001s)]
*  congratulations, by the way, here are some of the things we want you to do for us? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=744.6s)]
*  So they didn't. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=749.32s)]
*  Actually, there was one physicist, a very successful physicist who stayed in Iran and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=750.84s)]
*  he was against the fact that we were leaving because he was, I think he came from a more [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=759.72s)]
*  patriotic background. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=766.36s)]
*  He was like, we have to stay despite what is happening in Iran and so on. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=767.64s)]
*  This brain drain. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=771.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=772.68s)]
*  So he was against the brain drain and so on. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=773.0s)]
*  He stayed in Iran and for each time he was going to the conferences, he hadn't done his [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=777.4s)]
*  military service. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=782.84s)]
*  They had to leave some bail to be able to leave and so on. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=783.8s)]
*  He was bothered with this process to the extent that he went to head of the parliament back [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=791.24s)]
*  then who was Haddad Adel and he was connected to Khamenei through some, I think his daughter [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=798.6s)]
*  married to Khamenei's son. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=807.32s)]
*  So he found Haddad and said, look, I have, I mean, each time I want to go to a conference [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=809.8s)]
*  outside Iran, you're creating so much problem for me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=817.16s)]
*  If you continue to do this, I'm going to leave Iran. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=821.4s)]
*  And this is like, I mean, one of the stars of like a very successful physicist in Iran. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=824.84s)]
*  And Haddad came back and said, if you are unhappy, just leave. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=830.44s)]
*  We are actually, we are happy if unhappy people leave who are not satisfied here. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=836.12s)]
*  So you get this opportunity at MIT. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=843.16s)]
*  You come to the United States. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=846.2s)]
*  I assume it's the late 1990s and you're exposed to the US. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=848.36s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about like that eye-opening experience. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  You land in Cambridge and you're obviously at one of our top universities and you're meeting [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=859.4s)]
*  people from all over the world and you're experiencing American democracy for the first [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  time in all its glories and all its challenges. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=872.4399999999999s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=877.0s)]
*  I was totally blown away. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=880.04s)]
*  It was really amazing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=881.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, coming from Iran, that was, you know, I mean, especially that time it had no internet. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=883.48s)]
*  It was, you know, kind of like coming from total darkness to Boston, which is like, you know, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=889.24s)]
*  there are these all these amazing universities. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=895.24s)]
*  There are all these amazing lectures that happen all the time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=898.04s)]
*  All the famous people were like, you know, admired and they show up and you could just [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=902.12s)]
*  go to their lectures and, you know, I mean, there might be 20 people that, you know, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=907.16s)]
*  listening to them. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=912.36s)]
*  You're like a kid in a candy store. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=915.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=915.72s)]
*  I mean, MPR was on at my dorm, kind of like listening to all the debates that were going on. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=916.36s)]
*  I know, I mean, these days, MPR doesn't get a good, I mean, there are people critical of it, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=924.6s)]
*  but I mean, it was really like just hearing all the debates and people who were openly [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=930.52s)]
*  debating things on the radio and newspapers and so on. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=935.56s)]
*  So compared to the National Islamic Republic radio, it was more open. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=941.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=945.96s)]
*  The sound of the debate were broad. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=946.92s)]
*  It was totally different. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=948.52s)]
*  Well, it really influenced me in terms of I'm a strong believer in free speech. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  I think at the end, I believe logic and arguments based on logic have value in itself. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=956.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of things, people have to just kind of like discuss them and debate them [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=968.12s)]
*  and get to the bottom of the issues and find solutions. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=974.52s)]
*  That experience plus, and then I went to West Coast and I was in Bay Area. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=980.28s)]
*  And of course, I was right at the beginning of all that social media revolution in Bay Area. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=985.96s)]
*  So I was, I mean, the time that Facebook was started, Reddit, Dig, and all that other websites. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=991.0s)]
*  I saw that too. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=999.96s)]
*  So I thought we need to do something similar for Iran. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1002.6s)]
*  And I created this website called Balatrine, which back then it was similar. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1005.88s)]
*  It used to work like similar to Dig. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  If people who remember what Dig was. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1013.08s)]
*  But then we modified it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1016.6s)]
*  Now it works more like Reddit. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1019.0s)]
*  And it became huge in Iran. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1021.8000000000001s)]
*  It was in four months, they had exponential growth in Iran. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1023.4000000000001s)]
*  This is 2006. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1030.3600000000001s)]
*  And then it got blocked in Iran. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1032.28s)]
*  Actually, there's a funny story behind that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1037.88s)]
*  Michael Ledin, who used to be at FTD, who had just passed away. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1040.2s)]
*  Yes, I heard that news. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1043.88s)]
*  He was, he posted something. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1046.44s)]
*  He had a blog back then. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1048.44s)]
*  He posted something that Khamenei has passed away because Khamenei hadn't showed up for, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1049.88s)]
*  he hadn't given a speech for two months. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  And Michael Ledin posted this on his English blog. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1059.88s)]
*  Somebody tried to get in touch with him. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1063.56s)]
*  And Michael Ledin posted this on his English blog. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1065.96s)]
*  Somebody translated, one of Balatrine users, translated from English to Persian, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1069.48s)]
*  posted on Balatrine. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1074.5200000000002s)]
*  And then the news got, the rumor caught on in Iran. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1076.44s)]
*  And everyone was questioning where Khamenei is. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  Somehow the regime was so sensitive about Khamenei's death rumor that they blocked Balatrine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  They blocked Iranian Revolutionary Guards, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1092.44s)]
*  Mosul Rezaee. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1098.6799999999998s)]
*  He had a website called Bustop. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1100.12s)]
*  They had made fun of Balatrine for posting this rumor. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1103.6399999999999s)]
*  They got blocked because they just by, you know, acknowledging that rumor, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  they got blocked too. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1116.36s)]
*  So it's probably the best thing that happened to you because all of a sudden... [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1117.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1121.32s)]
*  By the way, anybody inside the Islamic Republic right now [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1124.6799999999998s)]
*  who's listening to this podcast, working for the regime, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1127.56s)]
*  please block the podcast because it'll only increase the popularity of what we're going to do here. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1130.36s)]
*  So that's how we got blocked at the beginning. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1136.12s)]
*  But then the next few years, of course, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1141.48s)]
*  the user base grew because people started using VPNs to get to the website and so on, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1145.72s)]
*  proxies back then. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1150.52s)]
*  2009, there was a conflict in Gaza. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1152.68s)]
*  If you remember, it was February 2009. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1159.16s)]
*  Again, there were people on Balatrine who were against Hamas. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1162.76s)]
*  Iranian government took it on itself to punish Balatrine. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1169.08s)]
*  So they launched a hacking attempt to take down the website. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1174.84s)]
*  The website was down for two weeks. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1180.2s)]
*  And by the way, just to understand, I mean, because it's like Reddit, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1181.64s)]
*  you're not curating this, right? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1183.88s)]
*  It's an open platform where people are just logging in and expressing their opinion on the site. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1185.72s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1191.56s)]
*  They tried to take down the website. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  The website was down for two weeks. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1196.28s)]
*  We got it back and you got so much support from people who were user-based and also everybody else. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1199.0s)]
*  The website became the central place back in 2009 for all the freedom-seeking Iranians. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1206.84s)]
*  And then the 2009 election went wrong in Iran. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1216.36s)]
*  And basically the Green Movement started back then in June 2009. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1223.1599999999999s)]
*  Balatrine became the central place for all the things that are happening in terms of [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1226.9199999999998s)]
*  coordinating what's happening on the streets, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1232.9199999999998s)]
*  in terms of the messaging and Balatrine. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1235.0s)]
*  Up until that point in Iran, you either had Iranian government messaging and media [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1240.44s)]
*  or reformists who were basically a faction of the Iranian government who just... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1248.52s)]
*  Worth reminding everybody. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1254.76s)]
*  So it's 2009. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1255.72s)]
*  There is a re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1257.32s)]
*  Clearly a fraudulent re-election, a rigged re-election by the regime. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1263.0800000000002s)]
*  And Iranians take to the streets millions of Iranians, many of them in sort of North Tehran, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1268.28s)]
*  middle-class Iranians, yelling kind of, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1274.92s)]
*  death to the dictator. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1277.48s)]
*  President Obama, are you with us or are you with the dictator? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1279.72s)]
*  And also, where is my vote? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1282.3600000000001s)]
*  Because I am voting in this election and it is clearly not an election, it's a selection. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1283.72s)]
*  It's a selection of Ahmadinejad and it's fraudulent. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1288.76s)]
*  So you have this massive uprising and the regime responds obviously with brutal force. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1291.4s)]
*  But what's interesting is that this platform, this Iranian Reddit that you've created, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1298.68s)]
*  becomes the main platform for discussion, for coordination amongst Iranian opposition. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1303.8000000000002s)]
*  And what happened was through that process, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1312.44s)]
*  I mean up to that point I was mentioning Iranian government and reformists, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1316.6s)]
*  they were the ones who were pretty much controlling the discourse. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1322.28s)]
*  But through ballotering, Iranians who were against the regime, they found each other. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1325.32s)]
*  So that was the first time the anti-regime discourse that now these days we call it [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  ban-dazi like regime overthrowing the regime discourse, it got formed. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1337.32s)]
*  Because all these people were dissatisfied with the regime. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1343.64s)]
*  They just didn't know that there are all these other people who are out there. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1346.6000000000001s)]
*  They have the same beliefs with them. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1350.76s)]
*  They just haven't found each other. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1353.0800000000002s)]
*  And they, through ballotering, they found each other that this course started. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1355.0s)]
*  And of course, ballotering didn't have the kind of technical resources. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1362.76s)]
*  They moved to other places like Twitter and Facebook and so on. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1367.16s)]
*  So, but what I want to say, I mean, and they kind of over-throwing the regime discourse, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1371.24s)]
*  even though there were opposition groups before that, before 2009 and so on. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1379.32s)]
*  But it became pretty much very popular and caught on after 2009, I would say even around 2012, 2013. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1384.52s)]
*  Well, I think you're pointing out something very important, which we've discussed on this podcast, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1396.04s)]
*  which is really this sort of growing recognition amongst Iranians. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1400.44s)]
*  Now, they are supporters of the regime, they're opponents of the regime, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  but amongst opponents of the regime is sort of the sense of, well, we can reform the regime, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1408.3600000000001s)]
*  Khatami, Rouhani, Zarif, there are these regime insiders, and maybe even Raf Sanjani. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1413.56s)]
*  They're pragmatists, they're moderates. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1422.92s)]
*  They want to reform the regime. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1426.28s)]
*  They want to make the regime less repressive, less aggressive. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1428.52s)]
*  And maybe if we just go and show up in these elections and we choose a Rouhani or a Khatami, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1434.12s)]
*  they can bring reform and openness and improve our lives. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  But I think then what you're pointing out is really actually there are millions of Iranians [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1446.6s)]
*  who have now not only abandoned the regime, but believe the regime cannot be reformed, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1450.9199999999998s)]
*  it has to be overthrown. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1455.88s)]
*  And you're providing them with sort of this first social media platform [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1457.0s)]
*  where they can now understand they're not alone. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  There's actually literally millions of other Iranians who feel the same way. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1463.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1466.2s)]
*  And that discourse pretty much took on and I mean, starting in 2017, we've had mass protests. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1466.92s)]
*  I mean, there's been so far four major mass protests. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1474.7600000000002s)]
*  They have, I would say, I mean, of course, when these things happen, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1479.24s)]
*  some people thought that it is the end of the regime and so on. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1483.88s)]
*  But I see them more as breakthroughs. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1486.2800000000002s)]
*  So they kind of like show that, yes, there is a crack. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1489.0800000000002s)]
*  There is we can, there's an opening to take on the regime. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1492.2800000000002s)]
*  I think one thing I want to bring up is all these things happen, a lot of them unexpectedly. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1496.3600000000001s)]
*  Nobody was able to predict it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1504.2800000000002s)]
*  And we have to see them as breakthroughs because we are at the war with this regime. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1506.68s)]
*  We just haven't been prepared. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1511.88s)]
*  We didn't have the logistics. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1513.96s)]
*  We didn't have the resources to take advantage of this breakthrough and expand that front. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1515.48s)]
*  So four times they happened. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1521.88s)]
*  We just didn't take advantage of them. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1524.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course, they closed, but they are going to happen again. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1526.28s)]
*  We just need to be. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's what I want to talk about. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1531.64s)]
*  And in fact, I mean, I think as we're recording this podcast, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1532.6000000000001s)]
*  there are significant protests right now in Iran amongst Iranian truckers, right? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1534.76s)]
*  Who are engaged in a significant and national strike. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1539.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, getting very little media attention in the West. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1543.1599999999999s)]
*  But once again, Iranians were in the streets 2009. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1546.1999999999998s)]
*  Then they're back on the streets 2017 every year, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1549.08s)]
*  women like freedom back on the streets, brutally repressed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1554.6s)]
*  And now we're in 2025. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1557.96s)]
*  And sure enough, Iranians are back on the streets. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1560.28s)]
*  And it's that persistent and courageous view amongst Iranians that we are just going to [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1563.48s)]
*  continue to come back on the streets and express this now, I think, persistent and consistent [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1572.6000000000001s)]
*  chant, which is to overthrow the regime, death to the dictator. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1580.3600000000001s)]
*  And again, asking another US president, are you with us or are you with the dictator? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1583.72s)]
*  I think unfortunately, President Trump is engaging with the dictator on another round [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1587.48s)]
*  of nuclear negotiations and we can get to that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1591.56s)]
*  But what I want to talk to you about is digital resistance and the real risks. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  And so you've been part of weekly calls for a number of years with activists inside and [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1597.24s)]
*  outside Iran. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1603.8s)]
*  What's been working in that coordination and what's still far too dangerous to do? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1606.04s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about these discussions. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1612.52s)]
*  In every situation, you need to know the context and the people who are there are our source of [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1614.84s)]
*  information to understand the context. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1620.52s)]
*  When you are in a conflict, you have to understand the details, the mechanism. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1622.52s)]
*  You have to be able to ask to understand why the extremes can happen. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1630.28s)]
*  Let me open this up a bit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1634.28s)]
*  I mean, in any conflict, you have to understand, for example, why the Iranian government doesn't [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1636.84s)]
*  arrest all the activists in Iran? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1643.4s)]
*  Why don't they run them up? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1645.56s)]
*  What is preventing them? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1647.16s)]
*  Or on the other side, we could ask why the Iranian people, I mean, we are claiming 80 to 90% [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1649.0s)]
*  of Iranians are unhappy with the regime. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1657.32s)]
*  Why don't they come out one day? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1659.3999999999999s)]
*  Why don't they sit one day in a year and just, I mean, everybody come out in Tehran to take [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1661.8s)]
*  down the regime? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1668.1999999999998s)]
*  A massive protest, massive labor strikes. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1668.52s)]
*  But actually, some of the things that happened in 1979 that led to the overthrow of the Shah. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1670.6s)]
*  So you need to learn about the context to see why these extremes don't happen and [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1676.2s)]
*  where is the space to function. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1683.3200000000002s)]
*  Iran is, I mean, you need to understand, like Iran is now North Korea. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1687.72s)]
*  So there are dissidents there with some room to function. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1691.5600000000002s)]
*  And you kind of need to understand what's their limitations, what they can do, what they [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1696.44s)]
*  cannot do and what type of actions are doable in Iran. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1701.56s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, Mago. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1706.76s)]
*  Because I think it's something that I've really puzzled over. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  So on the one hand, so why doesn't the regime go and kill tens of thousands of Iranians [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1711.8s)]
*  and just make it clear we will not counter any dissent? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  If you go on the streets, we will kill you all. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1725.48s)]
*  They have certainly killed thousands of Iranians. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1728.6s)]
*  They've certainly thrown thousands of Iranians into prison and other brutal security prisons. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1731.0s)]
*  And they've raped and they've tortured and they use chemical weapons to break the back [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1736.36s)]
*  of woman life freedom by going after Iranian schoolgirls. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1739.56s)]
*  All of that is horrible and done at a scale in order to, you know, kill, in some respects, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1742.76s)]
*  kill the chicken to scare the monkeys, as the Chinese would say in their phrase. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1751.48s)]
*  But it's been selective. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1755.64s)]
*  It's been selective killing, selective torture. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1756.84s)]
*  It hasn't been mass killing. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1759.16s)]
*  So why haven't they actually killed tens of thousands of Iranians? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1760.52s)]
*  That's an important question. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1765.0s)]
*  I think it's not that they don't have the intent. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1766.2s)]
*  I mean, if they can get away with it, but they do it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1769.16s)]
*  Intent and capabilities. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1771.6399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1773.16s)]
*  A lot of these regimes, there is a mindset and that's operating there. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1774.28s)]
*  There's an image that they have created. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1780.68s)]
*  I mean, this regime wants to present itself as the savior of all the Shia Muslims [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1783.0s)]
*  in the world. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1790.28s)]
*  It wants to present itself that it's the good versus bad and the bad is America, Israel, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1790.84s)]
*  and so on. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1798.2s)]
*  And we are the good. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1798.84s)]
*  So it's functioning within certain limitations. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1801.0s)]
*  Of course, it would crack down. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1806.12s)]
*  It would kill people. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1808.76s)]
*  It would make people disappear. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  As long as it could manage the propaganda, there is a limitation to what they can do. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1811.96s)]
*  There's a limit to how many Muslims they can kill. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1818.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1820.04s)]
*  I mean, to put it really bluntly, so you can kill as many Jews as they want, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1820.52s)]
*  as many Christians as they want. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1824.6s)]
*  Killing tens of thousands of Muslims when you're projecting yourself as the leader of [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1826.84s)]
*  the Muslim world has some issues. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1831.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1834.76s)]
*  And they still have a base. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1836.28s)]
*  I mean, I know it's 15% of the population, 20%, 10%. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1838.6s)]
*  We don't know the exact numbers, but they still have a base. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1842.76s)]
*  And I think they're protecting those bases with four key issues. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1845.88s)]
*  Like, for example, in politics here, you have like, let's not make up our heads, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1852.6000000000001s)]
*  let's go back to Iran. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1859.0s)]
*  So there are four key issues there. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1860.28s)]
*  From my point of view, they are protecting that base. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1862.68s)]
*  There's one hijab, one anti-Americanism, another is anti-Israel propaganda. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1865.72s)]
*  And one being we are the savior of Shia Muslims. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1873.08s)]
*  The hijab, they got defeated. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1878.6s)]
*  I mean, Iranian women, of course, they are still trying to get back, you know, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1882.12s)]
*  that that was a front they want to get back to. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1886.04s)]
*  But the Iranian women have been so strong and so persistent. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1889.72s)]
*  They totally defeated this regime on that front. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1894.84s)]
*  Iranian, if you, there are videos from Iranian government supporters who are so angry, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1898.76s)]
*  but they have not been able to enforce hijab. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1904.44s)]
*  And they are even attacking the Iranian regime. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1908.52s)]
*  Then they're asking, why don't you enforce hijab anymore, as before? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1911.0s)]
*  Do you think that pillar, that one of four pillars of the Islamic Republic, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  and really of the Islamist revolution, is all but been defeated by the courage [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1920.6000000000001s)]
*  and resilience of Iranian women? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1926.84s)]
*  I think the hijab has been defeated. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  The other three, I think we are. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1931.8s)]
*  So anti-Americanism is to some extent defeated too, because it's just kind of most Iranians [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1934.28s)]
*  kind of like, why are you not having like, I mean, establish a relationship with Iran. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1939.6399999999999s)]
*  As they chant, the enemy is not America, the enemy is here. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1944.9199999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1947.56s)]
*  So they are puzzled. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1948.12s)]
*  And even a lot of people within the Iranian regime just kind of like, you know, question [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1949.9599999999998s)]
*  the anti-Americanism of the Iranian government. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1955.0s)]
*  So that front, I would say, I would think, Matthew, if they ran serious polls, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1957.8s)]
*  I don't believe any polls in an authoritarian society. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1962.04s)]
*  It's like, hi, it's Friday night. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1964.68s)]
*  I'm calling you from the Iranian polling company. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1966.68s)]
*  I'd like to ask you some questions about Bameneh. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1969.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1971.4s)]
*  I think he's wonderful. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1971.88s)]
*  He's a lovely supreme leader. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1972.68s)]
*  I fully support him. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1974.1200000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1975.0s)]
*  You know, polling would be a very difficult thing to do accurately, I think, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1975.48s)]
*  inside the Islamic Republic. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1978.28s)]
*  But it's fair to say that, I mean, Iran is probably one of the most pro-American [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1979.24s)]
*  countries in the Middle East, right? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1983.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1985.0s)]
*  Iranians love America. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1985.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1986.6799999999998s)]
*  And we see that from the Iranians who leave the country. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1987.8799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1990.12s)]
*  And really come to our country and become, you know, the best immigrants you could imagine. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1990.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1996.12s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1996.52s)]
*  On the other two fronts, again, they've lost to the majority of Iranians, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=1997.8s)]
*  but not necessarily to their supporters. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2003.72s)]
*  We have to, so they, among their own core supporters, anti-Israel propaganda still works. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2005.8s)]
*  They, being the defenders of Shia Muslims still works. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2014.76s)]
*  It got damaged last year because they didn't, you know, support Hezbollah and so on. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2021.08s)]
*  I mean, at the time that Hezbollah, at its toughest point, the Iranian government chickened out [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2027.96s)]
*  and they didn't show up. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2035.24s)]
*  So that's kind of like their supporters now questioning, I mean, what happened to you? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2036.52s)]
*  I don't think I actually registered, right? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2042.36s)]
*  Is that if one of the key pillars of the regime and the Islamic revolution is, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2045.88s)]
*  we are going to export the revolution. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2053.48s)]
*  We're going to export it through the Middle East and globally. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2055.72s)]
*  And one of our most successful exports has been Hezbollah, right? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2058.28s)]
*  Is to turn Hezbollah into an Islamic Republic proxy in Lebanon and through the heart of the Middle East. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2063.48s)]
*  And then they didn't show up as Hezbollah was getting a beating from the IAF in the West Side. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2071.96s)]
*  How that actually played back inside Iran, certainly amongst the opponents, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2078.76s)]
*  who I'm sure were very excited to watch Hezbollah getting beaten. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2083.32s)]
*  But amongst the supporters, which is something that I haven't really thought of, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2087.2400000000002s)]
*  you guys are supposed to support Shia Muslims and you didn't come to their rescue. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2090.6800000000003s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2095.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, they didn't show up in Syria. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2096.04s)]
*  They didn't show up in Lebanon. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2097.8s)]
*  And they didn't even make an attempt to kind of like, you want to show up? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think in one of his speeches, he said, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2105.96s)]
*  oh, I mean, they couldn't get to Syria or something like that. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2109.32s)]
*  Do you think the difference between not showing up for the Alawites [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2114.1200000000003s)]
*  and not showing up for the Lebanese Shia? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2116.44s)]
*  I think there's definitely a difference. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2118.92s)]
*  Among the core supporters of the regime, there's a big distinction between [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2121.88s)]
*  Hezbollah and Assad regime and so on. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2126.2799999999997s)]
*  In both cases, I mean, they literally abandoned. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2133.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2135.3199999999997s)]
*  They're closer than allies. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2136.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2137.3199999999997s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2138.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2138.44s)]
*  And I think, I know we are diverging from our conversation, but I think [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2139.0s)]
*  I think Khamenei, we always have to understand who the opponent is. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2143.88s)]
*  Khamenei is a leader who is a very calculated leader with the sense that [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2148.76s)]
*  he's not a dictator like Saddam who would make crazy, like, you know, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2159.88s)]
*  invade Kuwait and gets like totally defeated by the Americans. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2164.92s)]
*  Khamenei has a method, he's very methodological. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2173.48s)]
*  I think he gets enough input. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2176.84s)]
*  There are think tanks in Iran. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2181.56s)]
*  There are like, I mean, a lot of the things you read from people who work [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2183.32s)]
*  on think tanks in Iran and Twitter, I mean, a lot of them are right on Twitter and so on. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2189.8s)]
*  They are processing the information that comes out of the West. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2194.28s)]
*  I mean, I would say to them, they're fairly accurate in certain ways. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2199.7999999999997s)]
*  Certainly more sophisticated. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2205.7999999999997s)]
*  More sophisticated. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2207.16s)]
*  Than the sort of, yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2207.9599999999996s)]
*  Than the tutorial regimes of Saddam or Gaddafi or Kim Jong-un in North Korea, right? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2209.3199999999997s)]
*  There's more subtlety, sophistication in their analysis. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2216.4399999999996s)]
*  And that's one key to their survival. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2219.3199999999997s)]
*  And we have to understand that this is, they are not, this is not Saddam, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2221.9599999999996s)]
*  this is not Gaddafi. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2225.56s)]
*  And, but I think last year this hurt them because last year was a chaotic year. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2227.56s)]
*  You needed a leader who would make quick decisions. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2234.1200000000003s)]
*  And Khamenei was not one. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2237.8s)]
*  And Khamenei, each time there was something happening, he delayed and delayed [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  on his decision making and he pretty much lost his, you know, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2246.1200000000003s)]
*  the strategic depths that they had in the Middle East. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2251.08s)]
*  So Mefti, tell me, what is your view of the events that have occurred over the past year [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2253.96s)]
*  as Israel has decimated this axis of misery? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2258.36s)]
*  Certainly Hezbollah and Hamas, Islamic Jihad, has this redounded to the benefit of the [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2263.0s)]
*  Iranian opposition or has it created, you think, some problems? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2269.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2272.44s)]
*  We are at a fight with the Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2273.7200000000003s)]
*  And Iranian government is a, basically a representation, a Shia Islam representation [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2278.28s)]
*  of this Islamic fundamentalism beast that has been created in Middle East. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2285.5600000000004s)]
*  And I mean, this is a, basically past 40 years has consumed Middle East. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  Any, of course, defeating Hamas, defeating Hezbollah, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2296.44s)]
*  helps Iranian democratic movement hugely because these are, I mean, there have been [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2301.4s)]
*  reports of Hezbollah, for example, helping the Iranian government at the cracking down [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2307.24s)]
*  protesters inside Iran. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2312.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, they bring them as, you know, snipers and so on. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2314.68s)]
*  So, and I mean, Hezbollah probably does for them things that Iranian, even IRGC members might not do. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2319.64s)]
*  So those are things that Iranian dissidents and oppositions have definitely welcomed. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2329.64s)]
*  And has helped them just because it's kind of cracked, destroyed the image of Iranian [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2336.04s)]
*  government as, you know, this powerful Shia Islam that has built this structure in the [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2344.52s)]
*  Middle East from Yemen to Lebanon. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2353.24s)]
*  And, but I think also at the same time, just kind of like what's happening in Gaza and [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2356.36s)]
*  all the, you know, human rights issues, the destruction, the images that are coming out. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2364.12s)]
*  These are impacting a large portion of Iranian public. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2371.08s)]
*  I mean, Iranian government is using it as propaganda. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2376.04s)]
*  We have, I mean, we are advocating for a democratic Iran that's going to be, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2379.64s)]
*  it's going to recognize Israel. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2388.92s)]
*  It's going to be on a friendly term with Israel. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2390.8399999999997s)]
*  It's going to establish scientific trade, all that with Israel. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2393.64s)]
*  It's weakening our narrative. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2398.3599999999997s)]
*  It's weakening our discourse because just kind of like, I mean, all these images that are coming [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2401.0s)]
*  out of Gaza and it puts a lot of the Iranian activists on the spot to make a position. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2405.56s)]
*  And my advice is, I mean, privately to a lot of Iranian activists has been to stay away from, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2413.24s)]
*  you know, Palestinian, Israeli issue, because there are people out there who are so [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2418.8399999999997s)]
*  emotional about both sides of this case. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2423.24s)]
*  And this is going to be a distraction for us. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2426.2799999999997s)]
*  So we are hoping to be honest for an end to this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2430.52s)]
*  I mean, just kind of that's impacted our narrative and it's been an issue for, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2433.56s)]
*  I think, a number of Iranian activists inside and outside Iran and hopefully it gets resolved. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2440.6s)]
*  So, Matthew, I'm going to get us back to, because it serves the purpose of [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2447.3999999999996s)]
*  my podcast, which is My Selfish Purpose, which is really to learn from great experts. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2452.36s)]
*  And that actually was a really interesting insight that I hadn't really thought of. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2457.48s)]
*  And it does actually suggest that even in the support base of the regime, there are [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2460.92s)]
*  fact fractures and fissures within this 20% and within the 1% of the elite that, you know, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2465.1600000000003s)]
*  if you were smart and you wanted to actually do like serious offensive influence operations [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2472.1200000000003s)]
*  against the regime, the kind of influence operations that Islamic Republic in China [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2477.08s)]
*  and Russia and Hamas and Qatar are running against America, that if we actually were [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2482.2s)]
*  serious about this, we could actually intensify the fractures and fissures within the support [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2488.68s)]
*  base of the regime. But I want to get back to the opponents of the regime and what it means to [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2492.68s)]
*  organize how we can use technology. Now, something I read really struck me. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2497.48s)]
*  I kind of, I took it in two different ways. You said that we need to look at the Bernie Sanders [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2502.4399999999996s)]
*  campaign to understand what's possible. Now, I have to tell you, there's no senator in the [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2507.24s)]
*  US senators that I dislike more than Bernie Sanders for reasons that may be obvious to [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2513.0s)]
*  listeners and viewers. But it is interesting your insights into the fact that Sanders, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2518.04s)]
*  this kind of old guy from Vermont, right? Sort of like curmudgeon, was able to actually mobilize [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2524.04s)]
*  this massive grassroots movement using technology and using really smart and adept [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2531.64s)]
*  organizing techniques in order to push a grassroots campaign that elevated this [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2540.44s)]
*  curmudgeon from Vermont into sort of this personification of the working class American. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2546.8399999999997s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that. What can we learn from the Sanders campaign? And then I want [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2553.56s)]
*  you to also talk a little bit about how AI can be used. Absolutely. A lot of the Iranian [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2559.0s)]
*  dissidents and of course opposition, we are, I mean, just probably on the political spectrum, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2567.64s)]
*  we fall on the right just because we support free trade, we support freedom of speech. And a lot of [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2574.36s)]
*  other issues, we might fall on the more on the right side of the spectrum. But I think on a lot [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2582.44s)]
*  of organizing and mobilization, there are lessons to learn from the left. And that could be [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2587.48s)]
*  applicable for Iran. And I think in this case, Bernie Sanders, he was a fringe, I mean, candidate [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2594.36s)]
*  of everything, Democratic Party back in 2016. I mean, nobody really took him seriously because [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2602.04s)]
*  he didn't have the resources and so on. But he had the core support among his volunteers. He had [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2607.64s)]
*  a, and his campaign managers, I mean, wrote a great book about this. It's called Rules for [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2615.64s)]
*  Revolutionaries. They had a very small number of staff members, like 10 or 15. And they had [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2621.88s)]
*  100,000 volunteers. What they did was they set up workflows, online workflows, to manage all these [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2632.76s)]
*  100,000 volunteers. And they put them to work. They gave them tasks. They gave them tasks to call [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2642.36s)]
*  people. They gave them tasks to set up parties across the US to get more, sign up more people [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2648.6s)]
*  for the campaign. They came up with all these small tasks that were doable by people who needed [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2655.1600000000003s)]
*  very little training and was measurable and doable. And it could be done, managed by this whole [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2663.08s)]
*  online workflow. I think that's doable for Iran. I mean, Iran is, people are well connected. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2671.08s)]
*  Most of them are on the internet. We have at least a few percentage of population is [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2678.36s)]
*  highly dedicated to this, bringing down the regime. I mean, there are a large number of people who are [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2687.64s)]
*  against the regime, but I mean, there's a core percentage of people who are open to take risk. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2694.04s)]
*  I mean, people will come to the streets each time there are protests. We have to come up with methods [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2702.36s)]
*  similar to what was done in the campaigns, of course, in a different context, but set up [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2709.56s)]
*  workflows for civil disobedient actions, come up with, and actually use people who are in Iran [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2714.68s)]
*  to brainstorm for new ideas. Me sitting here in the US, I don't know all the things that are doable. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2723.8s)]
*  I mean, for example, I mean, people could come up with, let's say, walk on one side of the street [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2732.04s)]
*  on a certain day of the week to just show your solidarity and protest, or I know wear a certain [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2738.2000000000003s)]
*  color on a certain day. Things that are doable and they show people there is a solidarity. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2744.84s)]
*  I think one question people have to constantly ask in these scenarios, why don't people all, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2751.32s)]
*  like millions of people show up in Tehran in one day to take down the regime? The key thing is [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2758.04s)]
*  people don't have the solidarity. People don't trust that everybody else would show up. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2763.2400000000002s)]
*  If we can increase the solidarity factor over time by coming up with a small task that people [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2768.84s)]
*  can witness, people can see the impact, people can see everybody else is thinking the same, and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2776.12s)]
*  they have the discipline, they have developed the discipline to take actions, then we could get to [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2781.56s)]
*  the point that we actually would have millions on the street. But we had Masih El-Nujad on our show, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2788.04s)]
*  and she talked about a few of the campaigns that she ran. My camera is my weapon and White Wednesdays. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2793.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think that's what you're actually talking about, right? She was appealing to Iranian women [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  that show up on a Wednesday, wear white, express your rejection of hijab. Send me that video. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2805.56s)]
*  Sure. Send me that photo. I will use my social media network to broadcast that. And therefore, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2816.68s)]
*  hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Iranian women will see that. And now there's a sense of, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2822.92s)]
*  wow, there's actually a critical mass of Iranian women out there. I may not know it. I may not see [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2828.44s)]
*  it, but they're out there. And I see it now on social media. And that gives me the courage [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2833.88s)]
*  next Wednesday to come to the street, rip off my hijab, wave a white flag, wear white, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2839.88s)]
*  and express my opposition to gender apartheid. Absolutely. So what Iranian women did, I think, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2846.12s)]
*  is a very good example of what could be done. I mean, most people like Masih outside Iran, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2852.84s)]
*  there were activists inside Iran who were part of these type of activism, and they created this [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2858.12s)]
*  opportunity. I think what we could do, I mean, first build, like make this scalable, potentially [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2865.16s)]
*  use AI, because now, I mean, I think this is a regime that's stuck in, you know, 1400 years ago, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2874.8399999999997s)]
*  in terms of mentality, our advantage is technology to defeat this regime. I think [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2882.52s)]
*  people, a lot of people forget, for example, I mean, in major conflicts like World War II, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2890.36s)]
*  it was a constant innovation that won the war, combined with logistics. And this is a conflict [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2896.04s)]
*  that we need both. We need technological innovation plus logistics. So Masih, let me ask you, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2903.56s)]
*  because Masih was able to do this on really on her own on a sort of shoestring budget. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2910.28s)]
*  One would like that these, you know, people who are behind Bernie Sanders and his Sanders campaign, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2917.8s)]
*  it would be great if they were, let's say, on our side. Sure. And they really wanted to use their [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2923.0s)]
*  skills and energy and experience to help mobilize Iranians against this regime. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2927.88s)]
*  Maybe it's worth reaching out to them and see some of them would actually like to help. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2935.1600000000003s)]
*  But what's stopping this? Is this a lack of money? Is it a lack of [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2938.28s)]
*  ideas? I mean, why can't we literally tomorrow night start this and start to build these networks [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2942.76s)]
*  inside Iran? You've talked about, you know, really building networks, also using labor unions and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2949.96s)]
*  guilds and professional associations, connecting those professional associations and guilds with [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2956.1200000000003s)]
*  their counterparts abroad. I mean, this is sort of taking a page from the Cold War playbook. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2962.52s)]
*  That Ronald Reagan was using in Poland with Solidarity and Czechoslovakia with [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2968.28s)]
*  with Václav Havel. What is stopping us? Is there is it lack of unity amongst Iranians in diaspora? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2973.0s)]
*  Do you really need unity amongst Iranians and diaspora? Do you just need a few tech savvy [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2982.0400000000004s)]
*  Iranians who know how to use technology and understand the rules of revolution? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2988.1200000000003s)]
*  Now, was that the name of the book? Rules of revolutionaries. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2993.1600000000003s)]
*  Rules of revolutionaries and start to start to apply that overnight. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=2995.96s)]
*  I think a lot of it is the issue of resources. A lot of Iranian dissidents work on Iran. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3001.96s)]
*  They're actually doing a lot of this work on their free time, like and kind of like down there, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3008.44s)]
*  you know, at nights and weekends and so on. So there is not sufficient consistency. There is no [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3012.36s)]
*  one thing we've discussed. I mean, we need like a team of like five people who are fully dedicated. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3019.4s)]
*  Like they put all their time to just and have a good network. And I mean, they have contacts [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3026.2000000000003s)]
*  in Iran and so on to just make this happen. And so far, unfortunately, that like we haven't had the [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3031.8s)]
*  five people who would fully work on this. Do you know the five people that could do this? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3039.96s)]
*  I know. Do you know the talent that we could actually hire? I absolutely know. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3044.8399999999997s)]
*  They're philanthropists listening to this show. Right. I have no doubt we could raise the money [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3049.3199999999997s)]
*  in order to hire five people who have the talent to actually start to implement this tomorrow. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3056.6s)]
*  I mean, this needs to happen. I mean, this isn't like a no brainer. It needs to happen. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3062.12s)]
*  We need to. I mean, for example, I mean, I've been to one training by Marshall Ganz from Harvard. I [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3067.0s)]
*  mean, on all these like, you know, how to organize, how to mobilize. And these are skills that are out [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3073.72s)]
*  there. Like, I mean, people have done this. This is not something like I'm not inventing these methods. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3080.12s)]
*  We just have to put it together for a wrong context and bring together. I mean, sign up [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3086.12s)]
*  hundred activists outside Iran, get like a number of activists inside Iran to join and get this going. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3092.8399999999997s)]
*  And at the same time, of course, reach out to the people who are political figures. I mean, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3102.36s)]
*  indeed, like well known dissidents with a, you know, political. You know what I see in the diaspora, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3108.84s)]
*  and you know, I'm not Iranian. Sure. Clearly. But I've been working on this issue for 22 years and, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3114.44s)]
*  you know, met a lot of incredibly wonderful Iranians. I see a regime that has been actually [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3119.6400000000003s)]
*  quite effective at infiltration, at character assassination, at creating kind of fake dissidents [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3126.28s)]
*  that they mobilize, at running influence operations in Washington and in America, at [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3133.0800000000004s)]
*  standing up funding, supporting these so-called Iranian American organizations that are defending [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3141.0s)]
*  Iranian American interests, but it really are defending regime interests. I see an echo chamber, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3149.2400000000002s)]
*  an Iran echo chamber that's been created quite patiently, well-financed, that is really [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3154.52s)]
*  supporting the regime in Washington and around the country. So I actually see a regime that is on the [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  counterattack. They've kind of lost control inside Iran. They've got millions of Iranians who despise [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3168.44s)]
*  them, but they've launched a counterattack, not only a physical, brutal repressive one inside Iran [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3175.48s)]
*  against Iranian opposition, but outside of Iran, of infiltration, of character assassination, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3183.08s)]
*  in order to divide your community and in order to ensure that a divided community that's turned [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3189.64s)]
*  against itself will not be united enough to mobilize against the regime. Is that fair? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3195.16s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, if you go on Persian social media, there is constant, you know, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3200.92s)]
*  attack, basically character assassinations of dissidents happening by other people who are [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3205.96s)]
*  pretending to be dissident. And a lot of them, unfortunately, I mean, a number of them come from [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3213.7200000000003s)]
*  really questionable backgrounds. And this is a method, I mean, Soviets have used it. Other [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3220.68s)]
*  totalitarian governments have utilized it to go after the opposition and create [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3227.48s)]
*  friction between them and so on. I have advocated and I continuously advocate for [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3233.88s)]
*  all the dissident groups and opposition groups to maybe behind the scene to come up with an [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3241.96s)]
*  agreement, not necessarily unite, but not attack one another, not to use governance propaganda [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3250.92s)]
*  against one another. And at least align their activities. They don't have to necessarily come [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3258.84s)]
*  together like unified platform, unified message, because I mean, they have different disagreements [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3265.7200000000003s)]
*  than different visions and so on. But they can at least agree not to attack each other. They can [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3273.96s)]
*  work behind the scene together to even create, I would say, mediation group to lower some of [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3280.52s)]
*  the frictions and this, I mean, fights that. So if I may say with great humility, not being part of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3288.52s)]
*  your diaspora, but being part of another fractious diaspora called the Jewish community, I think the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3295.96s)]
*  notion that Iranians who are a wonderful, incredible, and very successful diaspora are going to unify [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3303.32s)]
*  around anything, given the the interfactional disputes between the royalists and the leftists [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3311.64s)]
*  and the secular democrats, not to mention all the other shades of opposition and dissent is fanciful. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3321.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think it'll ever happen. I think the regime knows that the regime sees the fractures and [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3330.8399999999997s)]
*  fissures and is running influence operations in order to intensify those fractures and fissures. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3335.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's done so quite successfully. But what I, again, learned from this conversation with [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3340.84s)]
*  Mehdi, and thank you, because I'm learning a lot, is it really actually does take just a small team [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3346.6800000000003s)]
*  of people who really understand the rules of the revolutionaries, who understand technology, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3353.7200000000003s)]
*  and actually need to focus these efforts inside Iran rather than on the Iranian diaspora. And that [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3359.6400000000003s)]
*  with the right technology, with the right understanding, with the right ways to organize, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3366.04s)]
*  could make a real difference inside Iran and put the regime on defense, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3372.7599999999998s)]
*  which is where the regime needs to be. And then again, with your technology talent and the talent [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3377.88s)]
*  of many Iranians, the talent exists. So it's a question of finding the talent, assembling them, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3383.72s)]
*  raising the resources, and then also getting into Iran the things that Iranians need [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3392.04s)]
*  in opposition. I mean, they need VPNs. You mentioned it, VPNs. They need things like [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3397.08s)]
*  Starlink terminals because the regime is shutting down the internet, internet blackouts. If you [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3400.6s)]
*  can't communicate, you can't mobilize, you can't mobilize, you cannot ultimately form an opposition [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3405.64s)]
*  against the regime. They need money for labor strike funds. They need help from governments. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3411.24s)]
*  I'm not optimistic that the US government is really going to provide the kind of help. I think [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3418.92s)]
*  there are other governments, including the Israeli government, that may be more forward leaning on [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3422.76s)]
*  this. But there's a lot that can be done in the private sector from really smart technologists [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3426.6800000000003s)]
*  and people who understand. And maybe you could reach out to Bernie Sanders, former campaign [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3432.36s)]
*  manager. I should, yeah. They're surely not going to talk to me, but they may talk to you. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3437.56s)]
*  If you guys actually want to really do something meaningful to help humanity, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3443.56s)]
*  then help us with the skills you have to help mobilize Iranians inside the regime in order to [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3447.8s)]
*  fight against gender apartheid, brutal repression, human rights abuses, torture, rape, all the things [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3454.36s)]
*  that you as self-declared left-wing activists should be mobilizing against. Do you agree with [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3461.88s)]
*  that? No, I totally agree with that. I think one topic, I mean, I want to also just because you [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3470.2000000000003s)]
*  brought America and Israel, I mean, you mentioned. I want to mention this before our time runs out. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3476.28s)]
*  I'm a bit worried about the, you know, there's negotiations going on between America and Iran. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3485.4s)]
*  I want to comment on the negotiations because I often say that's not our game. Like, I mean, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3492.76s)]
*  we want to, like, we want change to happen in Iran. The Iranian and US negotiations is not our, you [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3497.7200000000003s)]
*  know, it's not our priority. It's not the game that we want to be part of. But we are worried [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3504.44s)]
*  about the impact of it. I mean, if there is an agreement between Iran and the US, okay, fine. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3510.6s)]
*  I mean, but we are worried about if that's framed as if the Iranian's regime problems have gone away, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3520.36s)]
*  as if, like, I mean, the way it was treated after JCPOA, as if, like, I mean, Iranian government and [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3529.64s)]
*  all the- Yeah, we solved the nuclear problem. So guess what? We know a long-ever problem with [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3536.12s)]
*  Islamic Republic. Exactly. And that's something that's going to hugely impact us and worries us. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3539.7999999999997s)]
*  So, kind of, even if that agreement happens, which we don't have a zero influence whether it happens [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3547.16s)]
*  or not, but we are worried about the impact of it and the way it's framed because [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3552.92s)]
*  you're just agreeing on a very specific problems that Iranian government caused. That's a nuclear [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3560.36s)]
*  issue, but they are causing all sorts of other problems in the Middle East. Let me agree with [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3567.16s)]
*  you on that and let me disagree with you on one thing you said, which is that you have no ability [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3571.8s)]
*  to influence that. You're an American and a lot of our listeners are American, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3575.96s)]
*  Iranians or Iranian Americans, however you want to hyphenate it. And the fact is you live in the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3582.68s)]
*  greatest democracy in the world, maybe the greatest democracy in history, and you have an influence [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3587.88s)]
*  on the negotiations between the United States and Iran. You have the influence on what a deal [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3593.0s)]
*  should look like. You have an influence on what a good deal is and what a bad deal is. You also have [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3597.88s)]
*  the influence on what a deal should cover and a narrow nuclear deal that gives the regime hundreds [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3601.96s)]
*  of billions of dollars that will not go to the Iranian people, but that will only enrich the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3608.92s)]
*  regime. It'll give it money to rebuild its axis of misery, the axis of so-called resistance, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3612.6s)]
*  which is really an axis of misery, which will make the regime more aggressive in the region, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3618.36s)]
*  more oppressive at home. Iranian Americans need to express that view. They need to express that [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3623.4s)]
*  view to members of Congress, who 52 out of 53 Republican senators have signed a letter [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3628.2s)]
*  saying a deal needs to look like this, zero enrichment, full dismantlement. 177 GOP House [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3634.8399999999997s)]
*  members signed a similar letter. But that letter also needs to say, or members of Congress need to [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3640.2799999999997s)]
*  say, that no matter what the nuclear deal is, that the United States should not release hundreds of [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3645.56s)]
*  billions of dollars to this regime that it'll use for repression and aggression. So that's the only [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3652.68s)]
*  area where I would say I disagree in the sense that you really can make a difference. I think [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3658.68s)]
*  Iranian Americans are getting much more involved in the political process, but they need to reach [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3665.24s)]
*  out to members of Congress, to your House members, to your Senate members, and say, we voted for you. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3670.2799999999997s)]
*  We won't vote for you again if you throw us under the bus. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3677.7999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3681.08s)]
*  So Merti, I want to end with a final question to you, which is really, you've got a career, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3682.12s)]
*  really a life commitment to not only to technology, but to resistance against the [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3690.6s)]
*  Islamic Republic and the establishment of a secular democracy. Maybe end with just some thoughts on [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3696.2799999999997s)]
*  how technology really can enable the collapse of the Islamic Republic and a free Iran. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3703.64s)]
*  Iran is a unique place. It has a very highly educated population, people who are online, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3712.7599999999998s)]
*  and there's been a proven track for technology helping the situation in Iran. I mean, in [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3719.08s)]
*  2000 or between 2000 and 2010, I would say blogosphere helped Iranians get enlightened, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3727.8s)]
*  and you had the Green Movement and the protests back in 2009. I would say the 2022 protests were [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3734.68s)]
*  really helped by what happened with Instagram and all the people who were being on it. They [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3744.2799999999997s)]
*  kind of shift that happened in Iran because a lot of people became more open and anti-hijab laws [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3750.04s)]
*  and so on. So they came out against the regime on that topic. But I still think there is even [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3756.44s)]
*  much bigger things could be done. AI is a huge revolution in the world and it's going to impact [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3764.9199999999996s)]
*  a lot of things. And a lot of people still don't realize what potentials this can unlock. And as [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3770.68s)]
*  I mentioned, we need to be able to organize a large number of Iranians at the same time [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3779.3199999999997s)]
*  with limited resources. I think the technology is there and this could be the first place that [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3785.48s)]
*  AI can assist a large movement for change, for creating a democratic Iran, and getting this [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3792.7599999999998s)]
*  ideology that's been basically the Islamic radicalism, Islamic fundamentalism. We can [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3803.96s)]
*  get rid of it. We could replace it by a democratic system. AI can help us. And I think everything [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3812.3599999999997s)]
*  opportunities there. I mean, you just have to focus on it. I think a big great irony. I mean, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3820.52s)]
*  I just thinking about what you're saying, a great irony that if AI brought down the Islamic Republic, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3827.08s)]
*  because it was interesting, it was another technology that brought to life the Islamic Republic. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3832.12s)]
*  It was Khomeini in the suburbs of Paris sending in cassette tapes into Iran that got spread by [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3837.56s)]
*  word of mouth. They were handed out to thousands of Iranians who listened to his sermons, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3847.0s)]
*  who were inspired by his message, and came to the streets, many of them expecting like your father, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3854.44s)]
*  that it would lead to a free and democratic and open Iran. And yet those cassette tapes led to [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3860.76s)]
*  the Islamic revolution and all this misery and darkness. It would be a great irony if it was AI [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3867.48s)]
*  and technology that brought down Khomeini's regime and established a free and secular Iran. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3874.12s)]
*  Mekhti, thank you. Thank you for your insights. Thank you for your great work. And certainly the [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3879.3199999999997s)]

*  The regime may still have guns, they have prisons, but its ideology is dead, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3917.16s)]
*  and the vast majority of Iranians want to see its demise. Thanks for listening, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMF8u78fLY&t=3921.3999999999996s)]
