Video Description: Welcome to The Iran Breakdown, hosted by Mark Dubowitz.
Whether you’re a seasoned #iran watcher or just starting to explore the topic, understanding the #islamicrepublic requires going back to the events that led to the #islamicrevolution in 1979. And to do that we need to revisit 1953, the year a coup overthrew Iran’s Prime Minister, Mohammad Mossadegh. If you think you already know this story... you don't. 
Host Mark Dubowitz is joined by Ray Takeyh—renowned Iran scholar and author of "The Last Shah: America, Iran, and the Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty." His research has challenged, clarified, and reshaped the traditional narrative surrounding these pivotal events.
Ray’s work isn’t just essential for understanding U.S.-Iran relations—it’s a guide for policymakers seeking to grasp the reality of an Iranian people who continue to defy the oppressive regime in Tehran. By the end of this episode, you’ll understand why.

# THE IRAN BREAKDOWN | Iran Before the Revolution (Mark Dubowitz featuring Ray Takeyh)
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8)
*  The story of 1953 coup touches all the erogenous zoners of American left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=0.0s)]
*  And just that's why it's... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=6.96s)]
*  Welcome to the Iran breakdown. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=9.68s)]

*  So whether you're a seasoned Iran watcher, you're just starting to explore the topic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=15.36s)]
*  Understanding the Islamic Republic requires going back to the events that led to the 1979 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=19.44s)]
*  Islamic Revolution. And to do that, we need to revisit the critical year in 1953, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  the year a coup overthrew Iran's Prime Minister Mohammed Morsaddeh. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=29.12s)]
*  If you think you already know the story, you don't. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=32.56s)]
*  On this episode, I'm joined by Ray Takeh. He's a renowned Iran scholar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  He's the author of The Last Shah, America, Iran, and the Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=39.92s)]

*  these pivotal events. Ray's work isn't just essential for understanding U.S.-Iran relations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=49.44s)]
*  It's a guide for policymakers seeking to grasp the reality of an Iranian people who continue [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=54.24s)]
*  to defy this repressive regime in Tehran. By the end of this episode, you'll understand why. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=58.56s)]
*  Ray is the Haseeb J. Sabak Senior Fellow from Middle East Studies, Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  specializing in Iran, U.S. foreign policy in the modern Middle East. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=68.56s)]
*  I'm Mark Dubowitz, and this is the Iran breakdown. So let's break it down. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=71.92s)]
*  Ray, welcome to the Iran breakdown. Thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=77.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=80.4s)]
*  So Ray, I was recently reading your book, The Last Shah, America, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=81.44s)]
*  Iran, and the Fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty. It's really a great book, detailed explanation of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=84.88s)]
*  what really happened, how the Shah went down, what led to the Islamic Revolution, and kind of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=92.8s)]
*  mess we're in today with the Islamic Republic. What really fascinated me about the book and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=98.16s)]
*  your writings around the book is this 1953 coup in Iran and the prevailing conventional wisdom [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=103.92s)]
*  around it, which you really have challenged, which I found really fascinating. So you challenged [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=111.68s)]
*  this longstanding belief that the CIA and MI6 orchestrated the 1953 coup in Iran. And I want to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=116.4s)]
*  talk about this series of events, but perhaps in order to position this discussion, what happened [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=123.76s)]
*  in 53, who was Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, and then we can talk about the coup and the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=129.44s)]
*  mythology around it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Mossadegh is really associated with the oil nationalization crisis. People always focus on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=138.72s)]
*  the 1953 coup, but the crisis was from 1950 to 1953. He was appointed Prime Minister by the Shah [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=145.84s)]
*  because he was a longstanding member of the aristocratic class, and he had long commitment [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=154.72s)]
*  to nationalization of Iranian oil and reclaiming it from the British AIOC company. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=160.4s)]
*  So this is the Anglo-Iranian oil company. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=168.0s)]
*  Anglo-Iranian oil company, which is, I think, today called the British [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=169.6s)]
*  Petroleum. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=173.12s)]
*  Petroleum, BP, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=173.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=174.72s)]
*  British Petroleum. And it is undoubtedly true that the British arrangement was exploitative. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I think the British government, which was the majority stock owner in the Iranian oil fields, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=181.92s)]
*  was getting more in tax revenue from AIOC than Iran was getting revenue from its own oil [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=187.44s)]
*  production. So the exploitative nature of the British presence was beyond doubt. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=194.24s)]
*  And everybody was interested in nationalization of the Iranian oil, the Shah, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=200.8s)]
*  the Prime Minister. So he was bought in, essentially, to forge ahead with the nationalization. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=205.04s)]
*  So everybody had agreed that the arrangement between Iran and the British government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=211.6s)]
*  should be rearranged. That's true also about the US government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=219.2s)]
*  So that began the process of nationalization of oil. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=223.2s)]
*  And the issue was no longer whether Iran would reclaim its oil. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=226.88s)]
*  The real dispute became what is the degree of British compensation [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=231.92s)]
*  for a contract that was abrogated once the British installations became nationalized. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=237.2s)]
*  Ray, what I want to do also is, before we get into the details of this arrangement over oil [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=243.6s)]
*  and then the series of events that led to the overthrow of Mossadegh, could you just zoom out [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=247.92s)]
*  and just situate where it's 1953, it's the height of the Cold War, Eisenhower's president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=253.76s)]
*  Becomes president at the tail end of the nationalization crisis. For most of it is Harry [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=261.28s)]
*  Truman. So it's Truman leading to Eisenhower. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=265.2s)]
*  Leading to Eisenhower. And talk a little bit about the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=267.12s)]
*  American view of Iran at the time. Because I think it's important for our listeners to understand, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  ultimately, what led to the decision for the CIA to get involved and MI6. What is the state of play [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=277.52s)]
*  vis-a-vis Iran and the Cold War at the time? Iran is a central part of the American Cold War [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=286.8s)]
*  strategy, particularly when the Cold War moves beyond Europe to what was called the great [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=292.96s)]
*  colonial realm, when you have the independence movement. So Iran is also, the oil is very [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=301.28s)]
*  important for reconstruction and rehabilitation of Europe as part of the Marshall Plan. So it is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  both its energy sources, its location on the periphery of the Soviet Union, and its general [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=313.52s)]
*  importance of the Middle East were appreciated by the American Cold War planners. And I will say [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  that the United States and Iran actually had very good relationships. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  And one of the things that is often not talked about by many is the benevolent role that Iran has, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  the United States has played in Iran. In 1946, the Soviet Union wanted to take over large chunks of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=336.0s)]
*  Iran in the Azerbaijan province. And what stopped it was the United States. So Iran's territorial [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=343.52s)]
*  integrity in the aftermath of the Second World War was ensured by the United States. It was the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=350.56s)]
*  only time during the Cold War where Joseph Stalin removed troops from places he had already had his [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=356.88s)]
*  combat forces. But it's early 1950s, again, intense competition between the United States and the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=363.84s)]
*  Soviet Union. The United States, I guess, has secured the European continent to some extent, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=371.04s)]
*  but a battle over, as you say, the periphery. And at the time, Truman into Eisenhower, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=377.6s)]
*  is there a deep concern about communist influence in Iran or are they feeling pretty secure that- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=384.48s)]
*  There is concern about communist influence in Iran. There's a war taking place in Korea at the time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=389.6s)]
*  So there's Iranian oil to some extent is important for British naval forces. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=395.52s)]
*  Britain was a large participant in the Korean War. Then within Iran, there's a well-organized [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=400.96s)]
*  communist party called the Two-Day Party, the People's Party. And its ideology was particularly [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=408.0s)]
*  appealing to student groups, the young intelligentsia that was coming at it. Also, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=413.68s)]
*  it was very effective in organizing labor protests and workers, which is what communist [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=419.84s)]
*  parties do. So there was a well-organized communist party at that time that was the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=425.44s)]
*  source of concern for the United States. And it was probably at that time out, maybe with the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=431.52s)]
*  exception of the Iraqi Communist Party, the most capable communist party in the Middle East. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  So you've got intense competition with the Soviet Union. You've got a strong communist party inside [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=444.0s)]
*  Iran. You've got a dispute between the UK and Iran over oil. And then you've got this Iranian figure, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  Mohammed Mossadegh. That's right. So who is Mossadegh? Where does he come from? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  And why does he become an important player? Mossad that was a long member of the Iranian [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  aristocratic class. He actually had a doctor in law from a university in Switzerland. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=471.28s)]
*  He was viewed as one of the more important figures in that aristocratic class. He had [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  held a number of ministerial positions. He was a nationalist and a patriot without doubt. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=483.2s)]
*  But among members of his class, Mossad that was one of the few of that stature who had never [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=490.88s)]
*  become prime minister. There was a reason for that. His introduction to power, I think, appealed to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=497.36s)]
*  his more authoritarian aspects of his personality, particularly as the crisis deepened. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  Mossad that was a head of something called the National Front Party, which was actually more of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=513.84s)]
*  a coalition than a political party. It had different political parties coming together. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=518.4s)]
*  And the National Front Party had a program that was beyond oil nationalization. It was essentially [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=523.6s)]
*  modernization of education. It was health care. So it had a sort of a social welfare, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=528.56s)]
*  European socialist style program as well. That was aspect of his agenda. But nationalization of oil [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=534.24s)]
*  was by far the most important issue at that time in Iran. And at that time in the political circles. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=541.36s)]
*  And I said, everybody agreed that it should be done. Okay. So that's Mossadak and we'll get to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=546.88s)]
*  Mossadak in a lot more detail. But I guess the most important political figure of the time is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=551.2s)]
*  the Shah. Can you say a little bit about the Shah at that time was fairly young. He had, he might [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=557.36s)]
*  have been his 20s. He was often very insecure at that time in his power. And you have to remember, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  at that time, Iran was a country of institutions, the parliament, the cabinet, the prime minister, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  the nobility, the clergy, the military, the landowning class. They all had their own [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=576.0s)]
*  independent power. So the role of the monarchy was essentially trying to negotiate among this class. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=582.96s)]
*  The institution of monarchy was respected by all, but it wasn't the dominant institution in the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=589.68s)]
*  country. Iran had real institutions. But he was more than a constitutional monarch. I mean, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=595.92s)]
*  he was more of a constitutional monarch. He has powers. But at that time, he was still trying to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=600.88s)]
*  negotiate his way as with the opposition, with other politicians, as opposed to impose his will [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=606.96s)]
*  as he would be later on. He wasn't as much of a despotic figure at that time. He grew into that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=614.72s)]
*  position by the late 50s, early 60s. So how does Mossadak become the Iranian prime minister? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=620.88s)]
*  Mossadak becomes Iran prime minister because the Shah appointed him to that position. He had a legal [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=626.88s)]
*  authority to do so. Mossadak was a head of what was called the oil national committee in the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=631.44s)]
*  parliament. And once the nationalization became the main issue, he was viewed as a natural person [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  to actually implement it. That was a mistake. That was wrong because he had a propensity to never [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=644.08s)]
*  compromise even in the, he was very obdurate, very stubborn in his way. But given the fact that he [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=649.6s)]
*  had made nationalization his most important political issue and he had support within the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=655.84s)]
*  parliament, the Shah conceded to his appointment. Okay. So because there's a myth that Mossadak was [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=660.16s)]
*  actually democratically elected. That is the case, not the case? Well, he was a member of the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  parliament and the parliament was notionally elected in a sort of a manipulated election. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  We're talking about a country with 90, 95% illiteracy. We're talking about a country that's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  ruled by aristocracy. So he was a member of aristocratic class who was a parliamentarian. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  And he had been a cabinet official before in various previous prime ministership, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=689.68s)]
*  but there was no national elections as we understand them with the democratic franchise. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=695.92s)]
*  So Mossadak is prime minister. Appointed. Appointed by the Shah. By the Shah. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=701.76s)]
*  In a royal decree. Right. And comes into office obsessed with nationalizing Iran's oil resources, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=707.04s)]
*  which according to the prevailing view, and I think sounds like you agree with it, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=715.12s)]
*  had been exploited by the British for years to the disadvantage of the Iranian state. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=719.52s)]
*  So there's a series now of negotiations between [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=725.28s)]
*  Iran and the UK with some American involvement. Tell us a little bit about that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=729.52s)]
*  The American involvement, you can ask yourself, okay, this is a dispute between the Iranian [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=734.0s)]
*  national government and a private British firm that has some ownership in the stocks [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=740.0s)]
*  by the British government. Why is the United States involved in this? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=746.64s)]
*  Good question. Why? Why are they? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=750.4s)]
*  Because Dr. Mossadak invited American participation. He wrote a letter to Harry Truman [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=752.16s)]
*  and said, you know, second world war, you have always been supportive of Iran. You were friends [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=759.76s)]
*  with both Iran and Britain. We ask for you to mediate this dispute. The United States became [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=767.04s)]
*  involved in the Iranian nationalization crisis at Iran's invitation. By the way, not necessarily [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=773.12s)]
*  one thing that the British wanted, but that's how United States becomes involved. And the first [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  envoy to send maybe the first envoy to Iran ever was one of the democratic party, one of America's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=787.76s)]
*  foremost diplomats, Errol Harriman, who had previously been during the war, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=795.52s)]
*  both ambassador to Britain and the Soviet Union. Before that, he had been the governor of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  New York and of course, the Harriman wealth was behind him. He becomes the first of the American [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=810.48s)]
*  envoys to go in and try to broker this arrangement between the two sides. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay. So this, there's no resolution of this conflict. You go from Truman now to Eisenhower. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=823.36s)]
*  Well, before we jump into that, I would say the United States made numerous proposals, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=831.76s)]
*  most of them advantageous to Iran. From the very beginning, the United States position was [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=839.28s)]
*  the British government has to accept nationalization. And then we have to figure [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=845.52s)]
*  out some kind of a profit sharing arrangement to compensate the British. That position was very much [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=850.72s)]
*  opposed by the British. The British were very antagonistic and displeased about the neutral [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=859.2s)]
*  role that the United States was playing in this. The British prime minister at some point during [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=865.36s)]
*  this process become Winston Churchill. And so the British argument was that the United States is [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=870.32s)]
*  unfairly treating us at the time when the British soldiers are fighting and dying in the Korean [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=876.96s)]
*  peninsula. So despite the British contributions to Atlantic Alliance, to the NATO Alliance, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=883.84s)]
*  to the Korean war, the United States took a neutral position between the two and tried to be an honest [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=892.4000000000001s)]
*  broker. That's not an easy decision at the time when the British troop deployment is necessary for [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=900.32s)]
*  forestalling the Chinese and North Korean attack against South Korea. Okay. So at this point, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  it's really British recalcitrance that's preventing any kind of deal. I mean, both sides, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=914.72s)]
*  Mossad recalcitrance and the British, both sides. So every time, of course, it's like the nuclear [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=920.4000000000001s)]
*  negotiations. United States meets the impasse. It comes up with more proposals. The number of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=927.68s)]
*  proposals that were offered were bewildering. And they tend to be very much about oil, this. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  It was, it was not to be bored the audience because it's economic history, but the United States tried [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  every which way possible to get a negotiated agreement. And I think if Dr. Mossad has signed [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=947.92s)]
*  up to some, they would have imposed it on the British. So interesting. So I think this becomes [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=956.16s)]
*  important later in the story. But so Mossad is getting used to the fact that every time he says [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=961.36s)]
*  no, or the British say no, the Americans are coming back with another proposal. Correct. And [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=967.28s)]
*  more advantageous proposal to Iran. To Iran. Correct. So I mean, he's becoming habituated to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=972.4s)]
*  this kind of process. Yes. The more he holds out, the more concessions he gets. That's a British [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  complaint as well. Okay. Correct. Correctly so. So next stage of the story. Yeah. Take us from, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=982.72s)]
*  you've got Truman and Harriman trying to negotiate a deal with Mossadegh and the Iranians. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=991.36s)]
*  No success. There's an American election. There's a new US president comes in, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=999.28s)]
*  evaluates Iran policy. And now you have Eisenhower. I guess he's secretary of state. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1004.48s)]
*  Secretary of state would be John Foster Dulles. John Foster Dulles and CIA director at the time. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1010.88s)]
*  Alan Dulles. Alan Dulles, John Foster Dulles' brother. That's right. That's right. So three [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1016.56s)]
*  main individuals who are going to feature later in the story. What's the view of the Eisenhower [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1021.28s)]
*  administration? Continuity from Truman or do they have a real break from that policy? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1027.6s)]
*  First of all, we have to backtrack a little bit. There is an embargo imposed on the Iranian oil. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1034.32s)]
*  So Iran is unable to sell its oil at this point. So there is economic distress within the country [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  that's provoking political divisions against Dr. Mossadegh. His coalition is beginning to fray [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  and so forth. So he has domestic political problems because of his inability to resolve the oil [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  issue and generate revenue. And the embargo at that time was very effective, you know, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1060.72s)]
*  because you had the Salmon Sisters in terms of oil companies and most of the tanker fleet was [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1066.16s)]
*  controlled by the United States and Britain. One of the contributions that the United States makes [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  to this debate as far as the British concern, it accepts the fact that the embargo has to continue [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1077.76s)]
*  because in absence of resolving the oil issue, the oil that's coming out of Iran is viewed as [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1084.0s)]
*  contraband. Now at this point, I mean, the British are obviously very upset with the Iranians. I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1090.0s)]
*  think upset with the Americans. Are the British at this point trying to persuade the Americans [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1096.0s)]
*  to support regime change and bring down Mossadegh? The British first proposal was to actually have [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1101.92s)]
*  some kind of a military strike and maybe even take over the oil fields. That was rejected in [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1108.4s)]
*  no uncertain terms by Truman. So that ends very quickly. That's under Prime Minister at least [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1114.08s)]
*  term before Churchill comes in. So the idea of using military force against Iran is rejected by [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1120.4s)]
*  the Americans and the British concede to that. The British next position would be that you cannot [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  deal with Mossadegh and there has to be a change of regime. That is their position basically [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1132.8000000000002s)]
*  throughout the Truman presidency. Harry Truman rejects that position as well because he says [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1137.76s)]
*  we got to try to negotiate and Mossadegh represents forces of post-colonial nationalism [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1144.16s)]
*  and it's important to try to come to terms with that force within Iran and within the larger, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  what we used to call third war. Now they call it the global south. So the Americans appreciated [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1155.44s)]
*  post-colonial nationalism as a force in global politics and appreciate that British imperialism [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1160.88s)]
*  was a waning feature and had to essentially be sunsetted and Britain has to come to terms [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  with the new forces as well, which the British in some cases were, but there was that lingering [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1173.52s)]
*  imperial and also it is remember that the Arbadan oil refinery facilities are not just the largest [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1177.84s)]
*  oil facilities in the in the world at that time but also Britain's largest overseas asset. These [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1187.36s)]
*  are Arbadan refineries in Iran. That's right. Okay. All right. So Eisenhower administration comes in. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1193.68s)]
*  What happens next? Eisenhower is even more eager for a deal with Mossadegh and he essentially says, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1199.2s)]
*  I think there's a quote in the book. I just like to give this guy 15 million bucks to stabilize [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  his economy while we try to negotiate with him as well. And the Eisenhower administration has [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1214.56s)]
*  his own proposal, which of course Mossadegh also rejects. And at this point, there's a lot of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1220.88s)]
*  concern that Mossadegh government could actually collapse and the beneficiary of that collapse [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1227.84s)]
*  would be the communist party because there was some degree of flirtation between Mossadegh and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1233.52s)]
*  the Soviet Union. I wouldn't say it was that serious and the Soviets were even more ham-fisted [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  in their assessment of the Iranian situation than anybody else was. So Stalin dies, right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1245.28s)]
*  Stalin dies in March 1953 and that's important. Right. That's important. Actually, most chronicles [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1252.0s)]
*  of Kudow mention that because it sort of affects everybody's views in a way that's disadvantageous [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1258.56s)]
*  to Dr. Mossadegh because Stalin's successors Nikita Khrushchev was actually interested in [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1267.28s)]
*  waging the Cold War more so on the periphery of Europe. So he was actually trying to bring the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1275.04s)]
*  Soviet communist influence to Asia, Africa, Latin America, as you see with crisis in the 60s with [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1282.32s)]
*  Cuba and the Middle East. So he was actually more focused on the global South than Stalin. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1291.12s)]
*  Stalin at the end of the day was a psychopath. Well, he was a psychopath that was kind of focused [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1297.84s)]
*  on continental Europe, but his successors are more expansive in their Cold War vision [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1303.2s)]
*  and Cold War competition with the United States. Okay. So Khrushchev wants to go global, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1309.68s)]
*  but he hands the Iran file to Molotov, right? Yes. The foreign minister. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1314.64s)]
*  And the most unimaginative human being on planet Earth. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1318.4s)]
*  Well, say a little bit about Molotov and the Iran file because I think what [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1321.76s)]
*  from my readings of your book and other things, it seems that the paranoia about communism taking [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1325.28s)]
*  over Iran is exaggerated. It is exaggerated. Because as you say, you've got sort of the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1335.36s)]
*  Soviets now under Khrushchev who's got expansionist ideas, but he hands the file to Molotov who really [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1341.36s)]
*  is incompetent and running the file. And at the end of the day, doesn't really exploit the opportunity [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1348.32s)]
*  inside Iran, though Mosaddegh is taking advantage of the situation to threaten the Americans and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1355.12s)]
*  British that if they don't do a deal, he's going to do a deal with the Soviets. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1361.1999999999998s)]
*  He does talk to the Soviets about using Soviet tanker. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1365.36s)]
*  Soviets has some tankers to export his oil. The position of the, I guess it was still NKVD at [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1370.9599999999998s)]
*  that time, the success of the predecessor to KGB, what Mosaddegh was a bourgeoisie capitalist [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  that was trying to kick the British out in order to bring the Americans in. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1383.68s)]
*  That position becomes revised by the Politburo in 1957. Well, that's four years after the coup. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1388.5600000000002s)]
*  They finally revised that position to recognize Mosaddegh as actually a nationalist figure, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  not as a bourgeoisie capitalist. By that time, of course, Mosaddegh was languishing in exile. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1404.72s)]
*  So if the Americans had access to the KGB files, it would scratch their heads. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  So the KGB thinks that Mosaddegh is an American agent and the Americans and British think that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1415.76s)]
*  he's potentially flirting with the Soviets and might become a Soviet agent. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  The Americans didn't think Mosaddegh was a communist. That's a line that the British [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1426.4s)]
*  used to actuate Americans. They didn't think so. However, what they fear that Mosaddegh as his [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1430.4s)]
*  coalition of secular, liberal or traditional forces erodes, he would rely on the Communist [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1437.12s)]
*  Party, maybe today party and bring him into government in some ministerial portfolios. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1446.4799999999998s)]
*  And this is not as crazy as a scheme because this is what how most of the Communist parties [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1451.6s)]
*  came to power in Eastern Europe. First, they became part of the coalition in Czechoslovakia, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  in Poland, in Hungary, and then they took over. So the concern that the Americans had was not [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  that Mosaddegh was a communist, that he would start to rely excessively on communists as he [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1471.68s)]
*  has little support left in other sectors of society. And eventually he may fall into that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1478.08s)]
*  sort of absorption by Communist Party as had happened to other non-communist forces in various [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1485.6s)]
*  places in Eastern Europe. And particularly here is the Czechoslovakia coup of 1948, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1493.12s)]
*  which is very much on the minds of the Americans at that time. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1500.2399999999998s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Okay, so into this context, you have [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1503.28s)]
*  a character, one of these real characters that unfortunately probably they don't exist anymore [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1510.8s)]
*  in the CIA. But at the time, Kermit Roosevelt appears and he is the grandson of Teddy Roosevelt [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1516.4s)]
*  and a distant cousin of Franklin Roosevelt. Working in the CIA, I guess, gets appointed to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1526.72s)]
*  head their Middle East desk of no, doesn't speak Farsi. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1532.24s)]
*  Soterios Johnson He had been in various previous [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1537.52s)]
*  iterations, had been a kind of a reporter that had gone travel to the Middle East. He actually [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1540.88s)]
*  had written a book about petroleum in Middle East, which was very anti-British. I think he had jumped [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1547.0400000000002s)]
*  the reporting for, as I believe was Saturday evening post. So he had traveled around the region [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1553.2800000000002s)]
*  as a correspondent. And so he had some familiarity with the region. But he had been to Iran before, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1559.44s)]
*  but he spoke no Persian. And he didn't have that much of an in-depth understanding of the country [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1566.0s)]
*  at that time. Soterios Johnson Okay, so you have a situation where there's a certain level of [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1572.48s)]
*  paranoia about Mosaddegh and the Soviets. You have oil crisis that is continuing without resolution. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1577.36s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Correct. And economic crisis. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1585.84s)]
*  Soterios Johnson And economic crisis. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1587.68s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Continuing. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1588.4s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Right, because of the oil embargo. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1589.12s)]
*  Soterios Johnson That's right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1590.32s)]
*  Soterios Johnson And Mosaddegh is growing more and more [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1591.04s)]
*  intransigent. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1594.5600000000002s)]
*  Soterios Johnson And authoritarian. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  Soterios Johnson And authoritarian. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Yes. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1596.88s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Talk a little bit about, and this is where you want to get to the coup and [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1597.2s)]
*  sort of what becomes kind of conventional narrative that existed today. Talk a little bit about CIA, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1601.52s)]
*  about MI6, Roosevelt, Alan Dallas. What's going on in terms of covert action and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1607.3600000000001s)]
*  perceptions inside the country? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1613.76s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Well, the United States doesn't have really that kind of assets [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  in the country. The British probably have more assets. But by this time, the British [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1619.44s)]
*  have broken relations with Iran and their embassy has closed. And therefore, the intelligence [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1624.88s)]
*  unit has also left the country. I think they moved to Malta, some to that effect. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  Soterios Johnson So they're handing all that assets to the CIA station [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1634.16s)]
*  in Tehran. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1636.72s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Yes. Correct. And the ambassador at that time, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1636.96s)]
*  Lloyd Henderson, was probably a very important figure because he was a really hands-on powerful [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  ambassador. The CIA actually an assessment of the British agents and assets that were handed to it [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1647.44s)]
*  was very unimpressed by what they got. They said, wow, this is all you got. So there wasn't much [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1654.16s)]
*  to work with as far as the CIA station was concerned. And Roosevelt, remember, sort of [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1660.96s)]
*  operates in parallel to the CIA station. So there's a station, and I should note, and I forget the [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1667.28s)]
*  gentleman's name, and history should not forget his name. The station chief of the CIA in Iran [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1674.88s)]
*  opposed the coup because he said that it would instigate sort of eventually as sort of an opposition [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1683.2s)]
*  to the United States if this narrative takes hold. So, but Roosevelt shows up, I think, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1693.3600000000001s)]
*  is July 1953. And as I said, I think in the book, if his description of the coup is to be believed, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1701.52s)]
*  and he wrote a book later on published called Countercoup, which can only be viewed as a work [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1708.24s)]
*  of fiction. But even if his descriptions of the coup can be, it was a kind of a leisurely gentleman's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1713.36s)]
*  coup. By the way, Eisenhower called that book that he wrote a Dime Store novel. Dime Store novel. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1720.64s)]
*  Right. When he was finally briefed on this, he goes, geez, this is unbelievable. Eisenhower [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1725.6s)]
*  knew something about intelligence operations. Sure. Because he was a supreme allied commander [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1731.1200000000001s)]
*  during the war and after the war. And of course, there's a lot of intelligence activities involved. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1735.52s)]
*  So he knew something about how the intelligence universe works. And he was very much interested [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1740.4s)]
*  in using the CIA as an instrument of American power during the Cold War. Eisenhower altogether [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1748.4s)]
*  would have, I think by my account, about three, four coups in the Middle East, three, four [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1754.96s)]
*  kind of operations like that in the Middle East, Operation Ajax in Iran, and one in Egypt and one [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1759.2s)]
*  in Syria. And they all failed. So the record of American intelligence intrigue in the Middle East [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1765.36s)]
*  during the Eisenhower era is, shall we say, not a good one. But wait, let's talk about the coup. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  Because again, conventional wisdom is, it was a resounding success, at least in terms of [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1778.8799999999999s)]
*  bringing down Mossadegh. And of course, we Americans have been [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1784.48s)]
*  expiating our guilt over it ever since. And you certainly, for listeners who watched the movie [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1790.56s)]
*  Argo, certainly Barack Obama mentioned this when he was president. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1795.44s)]
*  And Adam Albright mentioned it. Bill Clinton mentioned it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1799.2s)]
*  Right. We've been apologizing to the Islamic Republic of Iran for decades. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1803.36s)]
*  It is the most famous Cold War intelligence operation ever because it has found its way to [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1809.04s)]
*  colonize our popular culture. There's one thing Americans seem to know about the coup, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1818.24s)]
*  about Iran, is in 1953, we overthrew a democratically elected government, and that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1824.4s)]
*  established the Islamic Revolution in 1979. So intervening 25 years sort of never happened. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1830.96s)]
*  Forget what did happen or didn't happen in 1953, and we're going to talk about that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1837.68s)]
*  But there's a quarter of a century that they skip and go straight to 79. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1841.76s)]
*  Right. So we overthrew a democratically elected Prime Minister, a social democrat committed to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1845.76s)]
*  improving the welfare inside Iran who wanted his oil reserves back from those imperialist British. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1852.4s)]
*  And in doing so, we kept the Shah in power. The Shah became increasingly authoritarian, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1859.92s)]
*  increasingly brutal, his intelligence services, SAVAK, increasingly repressive. And really, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1868.24s)]
*  this set the stage for the Islamic Revolution where Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamists in [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1874.56s)]
*  partnership with leftist groups, with communist groups, with groups who opposed the authoritarian [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1881.68s)]
*  rule of the Shah, came together, overthrew the Shah, and took over and established the [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1888.24s)]
*  Islamic Republic. And as bad as the Islamic Republic is, say, those who follow the conventional [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1893.36s)]
*  wisdom, the original sin was 53 and was CIA MI6 coup that led to the downfall of the Muslim. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1900.88s)]
*  Okay. So you have challenged that. Tell us a little bit about first, before we get into the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1910.0s)]
*  narrative, how did you research this? I mean, how did you find out what actually went down given [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1914.56s)]
*  the fact that there have been so many books written on this, so many historical versions, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1921.52s)]
*  including Kermit Roosevelt's dime store novel. How did you start to uncover the facts? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1925.6s)]
*  Well, you kind of start out by a very basic proposition. Can an American land in Iran [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1932.32s)]
*  and an amount to overthrow a government in a fairly sophisticated political culture? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1941.28s)]
*  You kind of start with that and you say, well, I'm thinking there's more to this story. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1948.08s)]
*  This is a 10 part series on Netflix. Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1956.0s)]
*  It all happens in one season. I'm thinking there's got to be more. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1959.2s)]
*  And then so you go through the archival record that gradually becomes released [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1962.32s)]
*  between the years within the last 20 years, but particularly one of the most important releases [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1967.8400000000001s)]
*  of the archival record was during a secretary Tillerson's term. There was a about thousands [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1974.0800000000002s)]
*  of pages of documents, which were primarily intelligence documents, CIA station, national [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1982.88s)]
*  intelligence assessments, which at that time were done fairly rapidly. They were supposed to have [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1989.68s)]
*  been released, but John Kerry prevented that John Kerry when he was secretary of state under [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=1997.68s)]
*  Barack Obama prevented that because he thought it would jeopardize the negotiations with Iran. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2003.6s)]
*  The nuclear negotiations and that led to the joint comprehensive plan of action. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2009.84s)]
*  Right. In 2015, right. He stopped that. Actually, if he had released that, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2013.28s)]
*  it would absolve the United States of his complicity. But John Kerry being John Kerry, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2018.0s)]
*  which means a very low IQ individual who's best known for good hair and historical illiteracy, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2024.96s)]
*  couldn't go that deep. So once he stopped that and the Tillerson record, but honestly, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2032.24s)]
*  you didn't even need the Tillerson records to understand how happened. Because if you look at [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2037.8400000000001s)]
*  Iran at that time, what you see, and it's actually glaringly obvious, all the key actors began to be [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2042.64s)]
*  against Mossad for their own reason. The merchant class, which was very powerful at that time, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2050.96s)]
*  was against him because of their economic problems. The clerical class that will always oppose to [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  Mossad and was very close to the monarchy as an institution, but even the show as a person [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2063.28s)]
*  was worried about his secular band and also the communist in the flirtation that he was doing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2069.28s)]
*  And the military, which at that time still was capable of making independent decision, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2076.3999999999996s)]
*  as opposed to later in 1970s, was also concerned about national disorder. So all these three groups [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2080.96s)]
*  and larger aristocratic class of landowners and others concerned about economic decline, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2088.3199999999997s)]
*  and the larger public that actually believed in the cause of nationalization, but did not believe [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2094.48s)]
*  that it should continue to suffer. And they understood that reason why the crisis was [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2101.52s)]
*  lingering was because of Mossad's stubbornness. So the Iranians themselves had come to the conclusion [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2107.68s)]
*  that the prime minister who had some early stature was ill-serving them, particularly as Mossad [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2114.56s)]
*  becomes very despotic. He dissolves the parliament, he rigs the election, he begins to arrest his [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2121.44s)]
*  political opponents. The national front, which was a liberal coalition, begins to fray. He's [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2129.12s)]
*  increasingly isolated. So there is a national internal coalition coming against Mossad at that [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2135.52s)]
*  time, evolving against his ruinous rule. Unfortunately, he ruined us because he was a [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2143.68s)]
*  person of genuine patriotism. So there's a strong domestic opposition to the prime minister, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2150.64s)]
*  culminating in large street protests. And I guess the sort of conventional view of this is [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2157.36s)]
*  those large protests were actually organized, financed, supported, instigated by Kermit Roosevelt, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2164.1600000000003s)]
*  CIA, MI6. You challenge that narrative? Well, there are actually two coups. The first one [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  takes place on August 15th. So what is the coup? What are we talking about here? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2177.28s)]
*  And here's the American contribution. The Americans tell the Shah that you should dismiss [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2182.8s)]
*  your prime minister because he's becoming part of the problem. And Shah, who was a fairly lackluster [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2189.6000000000004s)]
*  and weak figure at that time, and that weakness would never leave his genetic makeup, couldn't do [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2194.56s)]
*  it. And so there was American pressure on him to issue what was called a fammon, a royal decree [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2200.32s)]
*  to dismiss his prime minister, which he had the authority to do. And finally, on August 15th, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2206.48s)]
*  he issues that decree and goes to his summer palace. And that decree is sent to him by an officer [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  at that time, Colonel Nasiri. He later becomes General Nasiri, head of the SAVAK, and executed [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  by the Islamic Republic. On the way to delivering this message of dismissal to Mossadak, to Prime [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2227.5200000000004s)]
*  Minister Mossadak, who mostly worked out of his house wearing pajamas, which I can actually [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2235.28s)]
*  sympathize with. Mossadak was tipped off by the members of the two day party because the two day [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2239.76s)]
*  party had infiltrated the military and had a lot of officers on their payroll. So he actually arrests [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2247.92s)]
*  Nasiri and ignores the fact that he has been dismissed. The Shah, of course, being the Shah [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2256.6400000000003s)]
*  flees to Baghdad and later Rome. But this is an important point. Mossadak doesn't disclose the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2265.04s)]
*  fact that he's been dismissed. At that time, when the royal decree is issued, according to the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2273.44s)]
*  existing constitution, and Mossadak never denied the constitution, he was not an anti-monarchist, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2279.52s)]
*  actually. At that time, his premiership is rendered illegal. Actually, Mossadak's continuation in the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2287.2s)]
*  in that role is unconstitutional and illegal after August 15. But then he essentially tries to figure [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2295.28s)]
*  out what to do, whether he has a referendum, whether this, whether that. And there's a second [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2304.48s)]
*  coup on August 19. Everybody kind of agrees on what happens on August 15. The dispute becomes [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2308.88s)]
*  what happens between August 16, 17, 18, 19. That's where the historical dispute is. And that's why [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2317.04s)]
*  the 2017 declassification of records was very important. Because at that time, when the word [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2324.56s)]
*  gets back to Eisenhower and the Americans, they say, okay, we're done. And the key figure for [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2332.64s)]
*  Eisenhower at this point in government is actually not the Dulles brothers, is a general called Walter [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2340.24s)]
*  Bill Smith. Walter Smith, General Smith had been Eisenhower's chief of staff during the war, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2346.64s)]
*  and he was Truman's CIA director. Eisenhower initially did not really trust the Dulles brothers. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2354.16s)]
*  He thought John Foster Dulles was too dogmatic in his anti-communism, and he was being pushed on him [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2362.64s)]
*  by the Taft forces. We don't have to get into that. But, and actually, Alan Dulles, who was a deputy [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2370.24s)]
*  director of CIA. So in terms of just the bureaucratic chart, Eisenhower doesn't trust John [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2378.96s)]
*  Foster Dulles, so he sends Walter Smith to be Dulles' deputy, to keep an eye on him. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2385.68s)]
*  So at that time, the deputy in CIA is Alan Dulles, but Eisenhower doesn't promote Dulles for a couple [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2393.92s)]
*  of months, because he's, you know, I'm not sure he's cool, you know, whatever. So it was Walter [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2400.16s)]
*  Bill Smith that told him, look, this situation is falling apart, and you really have to do [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2405.92s)]
*  something here. And that's, he was a key figure in getting the Americans to essentially cooperate [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2410.32s)]
*  with a coup. But anyways, going back, so on August 1516, the reason why I bring up Walter Dulles, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2419.2000000000003s)]
*  Walter Smith, is because there's a memo, I wish I had the text in front of me, he writes a memo to [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2426.08s)]
*  Eisenhower saying that the coup is over, it's failed, we gotta now, I think the phrase was [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2432.24s)]
*  cozy up to Mossaddeq. That's gonna be our policy. If you're gonna salvage anything, we gotta cozy up [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2438.56s)]
*  to him. And at that time, America being America, Alan Dulles was on vacation. The fact that there's [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2443.2799999999997s)]
*  a turmoil and coup doesn't stop him from actually continuing- [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2452.0s)]
*  From his summer vacation. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2456.3999999999996s)]
*  To go on a summer vacation. And guess where he goes to summer vacation? Rome. And guess where [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2457.6s)]
*  Shaw goes to summer vacation is after he flees Baghdad and goes to Rome. They're actually at [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2463.6s)]
*  the same hotel. And the crisis for the CIA is not to get the Shaw back to Iran, but to get Alan [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2471.52s)]
*  Dulles out of that hotel room, because they want to cozy up to Mossaddeq. So basically, they're [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2480.0s)]
*  trying to get Alan Dulles not to go to the same hotel. And they walk in around the same time and [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2486.96s)]
*  Alan Dulles said, oh, your majesty, please go ahead. So the CIA dilemma between 15, 16, 17, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2493.68s)]
*  is get Alan out of there. But Alan Dulles is not about to disrupt his vacation, because that's [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2500.64s)]
*  not what you do in 1953. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2506.56s)]
*  The 50s were such a great era. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2509.2s)]
*  They were a great era. So then the CIA essentially decides this operation is over, we're done. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2511.12s)]
*  It's failed. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2517.6s)]
*  It's failed. We're done. And they say to Kermit Roosevelt, get out. Kermit Roosevelt tells them, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2518.32s)]
*  well, you know, I think there's still enough ferment here that things could change. You know, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2525.84s)]
*  the General Zahedi and Iranians have their own plans. The military has its own plans. The clergy [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2533.36s)]
*  is very much allied with the military, the merchant class, there's enough here to suggest [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2539.44s)]
*  that the Prime Minister Mossaddeq's power grab may not work. The one contribution and the only [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2544.8s)]
*  contribution that Kermit Roosevelt makes at this time is actually getting the Shah's decree, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2551.52s)]
*  dismissing Mossaddeq and distributing it to international press, I believe it was UPI [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2558.08s)]
*  and Kenneth Law of the New York Times. And they publish it. And that's published back in Iran. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2564.96s)]
*  So then the public becomes recognized that the Prime Minister has actually been dismissed. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2571.52s)]
*  And then you see the Iranians themselves essentially taking command of the situation. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2576.16s)]
*  I don't believe, and this is again, a point of dispute that Kermit Roosevelt had much [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2581.76s)]
*  connections and those two, three days with General Zahedi, who was essentially the military [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2587.12s)]
*  ringleader, we are too preoccupied with crowds on the street. This is the old fashioned military coup. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2594.88s)]
*  They go in, there are crowds in the streets. There's that be sure. The CIA hand out some [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2602.08s)]
*  money to some crowds probably, but they were mostly instigated by the clergy. The clergy were [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2609.52s)]
*  the ones who came. Right. I mean, the CIA is, from what I read also in your book, is their [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2616.4s)]
*  articles are being published in Iranian press against Mossaddeq, but it's basically [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2622.64s)]
*  anti-Mossaddeq press anyway. So the difference is quite insignificant. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2628.08s)]
*  If you talk about the press, first of all, articles in newspapers in a country of 97% illiteracy. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2632.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. Irrelevant. Or less relevant than the radio. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  But there was also a pro-Mossaddeq press. Mossaddeq controls the national communications, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  controls Radio Tehran. So he controls actually the official communication. He doesn't control [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2649.2s)]
*  all the newspapers, but so that's, but the idea that it begins to infiltrate in critical sectors [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2656.08s)]
*  that Mossaddeq has actually been dismissed and Zahedi has actually been appointed to the position [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2662.3999999999996s)]
*  of the prime minister. So that gets out. Now, then there are crowds in the streets and here [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2667.7599999999998s)]
*  the communists overplay their hand, you know, talk about the Republic of Iran and all that scares the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2674.16s)]
*  hell out of the clergy when they start talking about secular and they start talking about People's [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  Republic of Iran, which everybody knows means a communist government. So the clergy get very [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2685.44s)]
*  agitated by this and very concerned and they get into the act in a more measurable way. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2690.48s)]
*  The only people that could mobilize crowds in the streets were the clergy. More so than I think [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2695.92s)]
*  other royalist elements. Was there some CIA money handed out? Probably, but I'm not sure if that was [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2704.16s)]
*  determinative. And actually the person who called in the military to repress the crowds [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2713.52s)]
*  was Mossaddeq. And of course he called on what was at the end of the day, a royalist military [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2721.6000000000004s)]
*  and they come in, they take over the radio station, they do this, they do that. There are very [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2728.32s)]
*  few casualties actually. Mossaddeq initially flees from his house. He takes refuge in somebody else's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  house, but he being too much of an establishmentarian to be on the run, he turns himself to the officer's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2739.2000000000003s)]
*  club to General Zahidi, where he's treated with respect and because of his long service to the [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2746.0s)]
*  country. The trial of Mossaddeq for which there are records, the trials that were available, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2751.28s)]
*  the punishment for what Mossaddeq did was actually death penalty because it was essentially [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2760.56s)]
*  disloyalty and betrayal and so on. But as Dean giving his long service to the country, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2768.72s)]
*  he would have a few prison years and then he would retreat into his country estate where he [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2774.96s)]
*  remained an exile. Effectively under house arrest. You can see relatives but not leave his estate. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2780.88s)]
*  You can see relatives. So that ends the Mossaddeq era. I guess the question is, and then I want to [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2786.2400000000002s)]
*  jump to the last part of the conversation about what this all means, is from what I hear Ray is [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2794.48s)]
*  the American role greatly exaggerated in terms of putting people on the streets, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2801.6s)]
*  marshaling the military, recruiting the officers, any kind of information operation, influence [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2808.4s)]
*  operation, quite marginal. But that there was an important role that the Americans played is in [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2815.6s)]
*  convincing the Shah to issue that decree to ultimately dismiss Mossaddeq. And the question [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2821.28s)]
*  I have for you is without that American influence and that American pressure, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2827.12s)]
*  hard to say counterfactual history, but do you think the Shah [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2831.52s)]
*  inevitably would have issued that decree? I'm not sure because when the Americans pressed the Shah [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2835.44s)]
*  to issue that decree, what the Iranian classes wanted to know in some way is whether America [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2842.24s)]
*  supported them without material involvement because they had their own resources and [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2852.48s)]
*  capabilities. So the fact that the United States was for the monarchy and against Dr. Mossaddeq [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2858.48s)]
*  probably had a psychologically reinforcing element, certainly for the Shah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2867.6s)]
*  Right. But the interesting element here that I'm learning from you is, I mean, there was strong [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2871.92s)]
*  public and elite support for getting rid of Mossaddeq. So in a sense, America's intervention, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2877.68s)]
*  whether it was decisive or insignificant, was actually in support of the majority of Iranians [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2883.44s)]
*  who wanted to end Mossaddeq's rule. At that time, well, and also the institution of monarchy [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2889.92s)]
*  was still a respected and revered institution. It had 2,500 years of history. And the clergy [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2896.3199999999997s)]
*  were very much vetted in the monarchy. They had a good relationship with the monarchy. It was a [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2904.4s)]
*  traditional institution that they understood and that dealt with. So the relationship among the [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2910.08s)]
*  aristocratic class was actually quite harmonious. Mossaddeq was a disruptive element of that. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2916.4s)]
*  And the Iranian aristocratic elite and the population at large came together and dispensed [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2923.2000000000003s)]
*  with the prime minister that they thought was ruinous for the country. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2930.0s)]
*  So America's role, again, the mythology is CIA working with MI6 to promote imperialist interests [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2935.92s)]
*  and oil, brought down the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammed Mossaddeq. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2944.8s)]
*  This was never about oil for the Americans. It was about communism. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2949.84s)]
*  About communism. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2953.44s)]
*  And disorder. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2954.48s)]
*  Right. But your challenge- [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2955.28s)]
*  It was about oil for the British. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2957.76s)]
*  But your challenge to the conventional wisdom, one, is if you look at the historical record, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2959.12s)]
*  the American rule has been greatly exaggerated. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2963.44s)]
*  Well, and the flip side of that is to get the Iranians to take agency and responsibility for [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2965.84s)]
*  their history. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2974.88s)]
*  Right. And that really is, I mean, to the second point, which is whatever American rule there was, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2975.68s)]
*  it was in support of the majority of Iranians at all levels who brought, who believe that Mossaddeq [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  was bringing the country to ruin. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2987.84s)]
*  That's correct. Yeah. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2990.1600000000003s)]
*  That's the evidence at hand as we have it, I think, is indisputable in that respect. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2991.92s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about what 53 means for today's Iran. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=2999.44s)]
*  We've obviously seen a large Iranian protest movement since 2009 in the Green Revolution. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3003.84s)]
*  We saw economic protests that transformed to political protests in 2017, continuing to 18, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3011.76s)]
*  19, 20, 21. And then we saw the woman life freedom protests of- [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3020.1600000000003s)]
*  2022. Yeah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3023.92s)]
*  2022. And these protests continue. I mean, FDD, we have a protest tracker every week. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3025.2000000000003s)]
*  We track these protests and there are dozens of protests still in Iran with brave Iranians [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3031.36s)]
*  on the streets yelling, death to the dictator. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3036.8s)]
*  What lessons do you draw from 53 for today? Specifically, and I want to ask you, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3039.68s)]
*  specifically with the question of toppling the Islamic Republic and Khamenei's regime today, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3047.04s)]
*  what are the lessons with respect to domestic actors, external actors, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3051.8399999999997s)]
*  anything we can really learn that would help us bring down a true brutal dictator, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3056.9599999999996s)]
*  Ali Khamenei and his Islamic- [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3063.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, there are two. First of all, I think economic pressure in 1953 [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3065.28s)]
*  deprived Mossadegh of an ability to sustain his patronage network and that eroded his ability, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3073.2000000000003s)]
*  his governing capability once people realized how dysfunctional the regime was. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3080.88s)]
*  And that's the role that the United States and Britain played in 1950-53. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3087.76s)]
*  The problem is when most people focus on 1953, they don't look at the full nationalization crisis. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3094.96s)]
*  The full nationalization crisis was about application of very successful economic sanctions [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3100.48s)]
*  policy on Iran, which undermined the regime. Both the Mossadegh regime and the Islamic Republic [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3105.68s)]
*  have one thing in common. They offer their people slogans. In Mossadegh's case, it was a very [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3111.84s)]
*  powerful slogan, nationalism. But when nationalism collides with your livelihood, people actually [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3116.96s)]
*  chose their livelihood. And the Islamic Republic offers a segment of public that still stays with [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3122.72s)]
*  it. Now, whatever that is, I can't tell. I think it's diminishing by a day. Revolutionary values [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3128.0s)]
*  and Islamist redemption. You can't eat Islamic redemption. So economic pressures were indispensable [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3135.9199999999996s)]
*  to weakening the Mossadegh government and establishing a context where his internal [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3145.6s)]
*  challenges could succeed in toppling him. And I think that's one of the lessons. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3151.04s)]
*  So lesson one is external economic pressure. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3157.36s)]
*  Correct. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3159.92s)]
*  Undermining none of the economic foundation of the country, but the legitimacy of the regime. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3160.72s)]
*  Well, the second is the United States began to express in no uncertain terms, at least to the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3166.32s)]
*  members of the elite and others, that it opposed continuation of Mossadegh's time in power. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3172.72s)]
*  And that had, as I mentioned, a psychologically fortifying role for those who were opposed to him. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3178.8799999999997s)]
*  It didn't instigate opposition to him, but I think in some way fortified it and solidified it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3186.16s)]
*  So it's sort of an American declaration that we oppose the current regime, and we do see a [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3192.4799999999996s)]
*  better future for Iran. I think that can actually go a long way in conjunction with economic [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3198.56s)]
*  penalties, a clear delineation of moral principle, which I have to say we actually [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3204.88s)]
*  haven't seen. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3211.92s)]
*  Right. From any president. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3212.7200000000003s)]
*  Or state legislatures or any. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3214.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. So it's the declaratory power of saying that we want to see the end of this regime. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3217.84s)]
*  We want to see a free Iran and putting ourselves squarely behind the Iranian people against this [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3224.6400000000003s)]
*  clerical dictatorship. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3230.6400000000003s)]
*  That's correct. That in conjunction with other things, it's intangible. It's almost not, you [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3231.76s)]
*  say, well, it's not palpable. It's just a declaration. But that in 53, and I believe today [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3240.96s)]
*  will have a salutary effect in. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3247.6000000000004s)]
*  Not inspiring the population against the regime because it's inspired, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3251.92s)]
*  but in some way, psychologically empowering. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3256.32s)]
*  Right. And Soviet dissidents say this. I mean, Ertan Sharansky talks about this when he was in [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3259.36s)]
*  Gulag in Siberia and Ronald Reagan came out and called for the end of the Soviet Union. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3263.6800000000003s)]
*  If you think about the rhetoric that we have employed in this country, I would say for the [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3270.2400000000002s)]
*  past 10 years, we explicitly say the opposite. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3277.92s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3281.2000000000003s)]
*  We think it's a point of high moral achievement to say we are not seeking and we don't believe in [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3283.36s)]
*  displacement of a clerical tyranny that tortures its citizens and tries to undermine the region. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3292.64s)]
*  I don't know why we think that's a good idea. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3301.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I guess the counter argument to that is we don't say that because we have always been [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3305.12s)]
*  or for decades, but in pursuit of a nuclear deal. And we think that we can get a better nuclear [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3309.84s)]
*  deal that permanently cuts off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons if we engage the Ayatollah [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3315.6000000000004s)]
*  and we create confidence building measures in the language of the U.S. State Department [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3321.76s)]
*  in order to get such a deal and that any declaration of regime change. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3327.04s)]
*  Well, any declaration that says- [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3332.4s)]
*  Would undermine that diplomatic process. That's sort of the counter argument. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3334.56s)]
*  Well, a couple of points. First of all, I'm skeptical of the notion that there's a diplomatic [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3339.52s)]
*  process that could yield to the kind of arms control agreement that you're talking about. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3345.6s)]
*  I tend to be skeptical of that. I have not seen any evidence in- [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3350.64s)]
*  What are we now? 15, 20? Well, nuclear diplomacy began in 2005 in some way. In 20 years, I have [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  not seen evidence that we can essentially achieve the kind of a nuclear agreement that any president [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3361.92s)]
*  can or should accept. But I haven't seen that. Second of all, why do we think that saying that [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3368.16s)]
*  aspirations of the Iranian people are inappropriate and ill-advised, a useful confidence building [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3376.48s)]
*  measure? Why do we say that? So we say that because to some extent, we are affected by the 1953 [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3382.72s)]
*  historical misapprehension. Let me just say one thing. Ayatollah Khomeini, who led [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3395.2000000000003s)]
*  the revolution in 1978, he actually despised Mossad. He never talked about the 1953 crisis. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3401.76s)]
*  He talked about it, I think, once, maybe twice. And once when he was asked about it, he said, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3409.44s)]
*  well, you know, what happened is during that time, Ayatollah Khomeini, who was a very popular [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3417.68s)]
*  anti-Mossad-e-Mullah, he said, I went to Tehran to observe a demonstration that he was part of, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3424.0s)]
*  which is not true. He didn't go to Tehran. But anyway, he said when he was leading a procession, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3430.16s)]
*  the National Front people came and like handed him a dog and dog is of course in the Muslim [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3436.88s)]
*  imagination, sort of a sinful dirty unclean. So essentially, his only comment on the National [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3444.4s)]
*  Front in 53 was that it was essentially disparaging the clergy. Second, it is the position of the [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3454.2400000000002s)]
*  Islamic Republic in 1979, its position of Ayatollah Khomeini, that the reason why all previous [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3463.04s)]
*  revolts against the Shah failed, including the Mossad government, was because they did not [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3470.24s)]
*  enjoy divine approbation. Third of all, it was the Islamic Republic that actually outlawed the [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3476.08s)]
*  National Front, Dr. Mossad's party. So the relationship between the clerical leaders in [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3482.9599999999996s)]
*  Iran and the National Front is actually a very contested one. And they tend to be very disparaging [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3488.72s)]
*  of Mossad because at the end of the day, he was a secular person, and he wanted to kind of secularism, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3495.52s)]
*  he bended toward secularism more so than religious orthodoxy, and certainly more so than religious [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3500.64s)]
*  reaction. So they actually, the clerical leaders tend to despise Mossad and the National Front. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3505.7599999999998s)]
*  It is their diplomats that use that as a means of extracting a declaratory statement by the United [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3513.36s)]
*  States representatives that is ill-advised and actually quite morally vacuous. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3520.4s)]
*  Well, that's actually interesting. And I want to sort of end with this because it's really [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3526.32s)]
*  fascinating to me the sort of development of the mythology around Mossadegh and how, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, Western diplomats and policymakers have swallowed entirely this narrative. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3534.2400000000002s)]
*  By the way, the Western mythology, they don't say Mossadegh was overthrown by CIA. They say [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3537.6800000000003s)]
*  he was overthrown because God didn't like him. God liked us. We succeeded. God didn't like him. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3543.28s)]
*  And as far as I know, I don't know much about CIA, but I don't think they can control God. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3550.64s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because you talked about Iranian diplomats. It seems to me that [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3559.12s)]
*  the best practitioner of this, of promoting this mythology has been Java Zarif. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3563.28s)]
*  Right. And others. And others. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3569.6s)]
*  So say a few words about that. I actually do recall just sort of as a funny anecdote. When [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3571.12s)]
*  you were writing on this and you were doing a number of articles on this historical period [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3577.28s)]
*  and I was tweeting them out, I obviously got an interesting reaction from a lot of Iranians, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of Iranian experts, some supporting you, others opposing you, but was actually Zarif, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3589.1200000000003s)]
*  who was most vociferous in responding. And I have a sneaking suspicion, though I have never been [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3594.4s)]
*  able to validate that one of the reasons that the Islamic Republic actually sanctioned me [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3600.96s)]
*  was because I was promoting your theory of the case with respect to 53. And I have enough [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3608.8s)]
*  suggested evidence to offer that publicly. To be fair, there are many reasons why the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3615.2s)]
*  Islamic Republic was seek to sanction you. But being friends with Ray is one of them. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3619.68s)]
*  Well, they're well correct. There's a lot of reasons. There are many reasons. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3623.52s)]
*  But historical inerrancy may in fact have contributed to that. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3628.3199999999997s)]
*  Let me end with this question because I think this is important. It's one of the reasons I wanted [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3633.3599999999997s)]
*  to have you on this podcast, right? You wrote an entire book on this. You wrote numerous articles [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3636.7999999999997s)]
*  and foreign affairs and other publications on your research. Why have you been unable to still [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3643.3599999999997s)]
*  counter this mythology, this narrative? I don't mean to ask you that question about why have you [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3652.16s)]
*  been unsuccessful because- Because I have been unsuccessful. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3661.52s)]
*  Because you have been unsuccessful. Because you should have written more, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3663.92s)]
*  you should have been out more. That's not the thrust of my question. The thrust of my question [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3667.04s)]
*  is why do Westerners want to hold on to this myth? What is it about this myth that is so important [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3671.6s)]
*  to us? The myth is important to the academic left, which has controlled the universities [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3678.08s)]
*  and the textbooks and historical reconstruction because it allows them to indict the United States [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3686.72s)]
*  for aborting a democratic practice among third world people. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3694.3199999999997s)]
*  So for the academic left, it has everything, right? It has nefarious imperialists, it has British [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3702.8s)]
*  oil man, it has sneaky CIA agents. It's like the ultimate intellectual pornography. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3709.04s)]
*  It's just missing the Jews. I mean, if it had the Jews, that would be a perfect story. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3715.76s)]
*  It's the ultimate intellectual pornography for them. So that's for the left. And for the American [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3720.16s)]
*  diplomatic class, diplomatic establishment, who tends to absorb that sort of leftist jargon [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3727.68s)]
*  and leftist treaties, it's a way of appealing to the Islamic Republic as a means of, as you said, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3736.8799999999997s)]
*  facilitating negotiations. They tend to believe a proper way of negotiating with what you always [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3744.16s)]
*  call the hardened men of Iran is to begin with an apology about a historical event that they don't [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3750.7999999999997s)]
*  care about. They don't celebrate, they don't acknowledge, and in fact, they denigrate. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3756.88s)]
*  They being the Islamic public. Correct. So it's the merger of the diplomatic class and the academic [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3763.2000000000003s)]
*  left, and then you bring in Hollywood producers into this, which are also liberal in their political [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  disposition. So you got this kind of a triad. And in middle of this glamour party comes a nobody [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3775.76s)]
*  named Ray Takeh saying, wait a minute, we actually have documents about this. So it disrupts the [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3784.08s)]
*  glamour party. Right. I do. And then you've got Kermit Roosevelt's dime store novel. But to be [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3793.2799999999997s)]
*  fair, against Ray Takeh's academic treatise. Most historians tend to downplay that account of [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3800.64s)]
*  Roosevelt as exaggerated and so forth. But they nevertheless as self-serving and all that, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3807.36s)]
*  because you also cannot really credit a CIA agent. So they have their own body of work [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3813.36s)]
*  that they point to. As I said, the story of 1953 coup touches all the erogenous zoners of American [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3823.84s)]
*  left. And that's why it's persist. As I said, in middle of this glamour party comes one person [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3832.8s)]
*  with this sort of a revisionist account, which as you have kindly mentioned, has been largely, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3842.4s)]
*  if not entirely ineffective in changing the narrative. Well, Ray, I think a good place to [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3848.88s)]
*  end this discussion is on left-wing erogenous zones. So with that, thank you very much. Fascinating [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3853.52s)]
*  conversation. We will continue to do our best to puncture the misapprehensions and myths of what [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3859.12s)]
*  happened in 1953, because it is incredibly consequential for what's happening in 2025. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3867.68s)]
*  So Ray, thanks a lot. We look forward to having you back. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3872.16s)]
*  So today we covered an important lesson, one that I'm always going to keep in mind when analyzing [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3876.0s)]
*  Iran. And one that will serve you well when you listen to the Iran breakdown coming episodes. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3880.48s)]
*  And that is not everything is as it seems. Not everything you've been reading or been told is [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3886.56s)]
*  accurate. Like take 53. New evidence challenges this conventional narrative about this pivotal [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3891.68s)]
*  moment. One that ultimately set the stage for Ayatollah Khomeini's rise and the birth of the [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3896.64s)]
*  Islamic Republic. And this demands that we rethink not just the past, but I think also the future, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3901.2799999999997s)]
*  especially how the US and our allies approach the current regime. Ray Take's research makes [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3906.48s)]
*  one thing clear, that historically real political change in Iran has come from within Iran. But [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3912.08s)]
*  external players can play a supporting role. And that's a critical point, I think, for Western [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3916.8799999999997s)]
*  policymakers. And we should take it seriously. We'll explore exactly why and what it means for [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3920.96s)]
*  Iran's future later in the series when we discuss the women life freedom movement shaking the [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3925.76s)]
*  foundations of the Islamic Republic. I'm Mark Dubwitz, and this has been the Iran breakdown. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3930.5600000000004s)]
*  Thanks for tuning in. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGdtSc2DY8&t=3935.36s)]
