Video Description: Hezbollah is not a rogue actor. It’s a tool of the Islamic Republic. 
 
That’s because Iran doesn’t just fund terror — it runs a global terror empire. And Hezbollah is the crown jewel.
 
In this episode of The Iran Breakdown, host Mark Dubowitz sits down with Dr. Matthew Levitt, a top authority on Hezbollah and Iran’s proxy warfare, to break down how Hezbollah operates as Iran’s most powerful proxy; its deep involvement in terror plots, weapons trafficking, and criminal finance; the group’s expanding footprint around the world; what the US, Israel, and allies must do to dismantle this network; and why Hezbollah’s role is central to Tehran’s long-term strategy — and its survival.

# THE IRAN BREAKDOWN | Terror Without Borders: #hezbollah Inc. & Beyond (Mark Dubowitz & Matt Levitt)
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s)
*  Hezbollah does have networks around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=0.0s)]
*  You know those disposable ice packs, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  see if your kid twists their ankle in soccer practice [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4.12s)]
*  and you break the membrane and shake it up [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and it gets really cold for 20 minutes? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=8.24s)]
*  Well, if you don't break that membrane in each side [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=9.96s)]
*  and you take that chemical material [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=12.24s)]
*  and combine it with some other stuff [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=13.84s)]
*  that's publicly available, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=15.32s)]
*  you've got most of what you need [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=16.32s)]
*  to make an ammonium nitrate bomb. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=17.2s)]
*  And that's been a modus operandi of Hezbollah [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=18.68s)]
*  around the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=20.56s)]
*  We even had a Hezbollah ammonium nitrate case [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  in Houston, Texas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Welcome back to the Iran Breakdown. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=24.72s)]
*  I'm your host, Mark Dugowitz. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=26.32s)]
*  Today we're zeroing in on one of the deadliest weapons [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  in the regime in Iran's arsenal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=30.48s)]
*  And no, it's not the nuclear bomb. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  It's Tehran's global terror network. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=34.4s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=36.84s)]
*  Hamas in Palestine and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=38.2s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=40.92s)]
*  Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=42.0s)]
*  from the Middle East to Africa, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=44.04s)]
*  Latin America and Asia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  This isn't chaos, it's strategy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=47.32s)]
*  The regime in Iran has built a terror empire [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  that spans the globe, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  operated by its proxies, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=52.92s)]
*  funded by the regime, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  fueled by its goal to dominate the region [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=55.72s)]
*  and threaten the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=57.72s)]
*  That is why the United States rightly calls [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  the Islamic Republic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=60.64s)]
*  the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=61.6s)]
*  And these proxies aren't hiding. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=64.2s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas are still striking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=65.92s)]
*  after taking heavy hits from Israeli intelligence [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=67.84s)]
*  and military operations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=70.12s)]
*  The Houthis are launching missiles at international shipping [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=71.52s)]
*  in the US Navy and the Red Sea, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=74.12s)]
*  trying to strangle global trade. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=75.8s)]
*  Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=77.6s)]
*  have attacked US troops, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=79.52s)]
*  triggering US airstrikes and retaliation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=80.68s)]
*  against both the Houthis and the Shiite militias. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel is landing real blows. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=85.64s)]
*  The US is hitting back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=87.6s)]
*  But the Islamic Republic keeps pushing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=89.16s)]
*  This is the regime's playbook. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Wage war through proxies, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  dodge the consequences and destabilize the world. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=94.24s)]
*  It's one more reason this regime must fall. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=97.24s)]
*  To break it all down, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=99.72s)]
*  I'm joined by Dr. Matt Levitt [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=100.56s)]
*  of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=101.8s)]
*  He's a former senior official [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  at the US Treasury and FBI, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=105.24s)]
*  one of the world's top experts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  on Iran's terror network, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  its financing and its global reach. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=110.84s)]
*  Today we're gonna unpack how Iran and Hezbollah [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  operate, the threats they pose, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  and how the United States, Israel, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=117.56s)]
*  and our allies can help stop it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=119.44s)]
*  So let's break it down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=121.76s)]
*  ["Iran's Lies"] [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Matt, wonderful to see you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=124.68s)]
*  Thank you for joining the Iran Breakdown. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=128.72s)]
*  And so, Matt, we're gonna break it down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=130.6s)]
*  We're gonna look at the entire proxy network [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=132.4s)]
*  that the regime has been sponsoring for many years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=134.52s)]
*  But before we get there, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=137.08s)]
*  I wanna talk a little bit about Matt Levitt, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=138.04s)]
*  the man, the myth, the legend. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Your background, how did you get involved in this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=144.2s)]
*  How did you get interested in this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=146.24s)]
*  Tell us a bit about your background. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  First of all, it's a pleasure to be here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=149.6s)]
*  I'm really excited to be doing this podcast. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=150.88s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=152.28s)]
*  Make a long story short, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=155.28s)]
*  I thought I was gonna be another, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=156.96s)]
*  or the next Dennis Ross when I first started out, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=158.92s)]
*  probably because the first week [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=161.04s)]
*  of my graduate school career was Oslo. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=162.4s)]
*  And that got a lot of people very, very excited. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  And- [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=168.68s)]
*  So this was the Oslo peace process in the 1990s. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  1993. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's how young I am. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=173.6s)]
*  And as I continued past my master's into my PhD, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=174.92s)]
*  I wrote a PhD that was very much [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=179.76s)]
*  a conflict resolution theory-based piece, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  but basically looking at how terrorist attacks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=183.48s)]
*  undermine a negotiation process, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=186.0s)]
*  undermine the legitimacy of the leader of one side, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  the perception of the leader on the other side, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=191.2s)]
*  the legitimacy of the process overall, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=192.92s)]
*  all kinds of technical things like that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=194.72s)]
*  Did the PhD eventually, published it as a book eventually. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=197.56s)]
*  But the conclusion of it, to me personally, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=200.68s)]
*  there will always be really smart people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=204.52s)]
*  who will be able to figure out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=207.16s)]
*  where to draw the boundary line [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=208.72s)]
*  and how to deal with water rights [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=210.32s)]
*  and right of return and those types of things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=212.0s)]
*  If you really wanted there to be space [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=214.84s)]
*  within which any type of agreement [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=217.6s)]
*  in the Israeli-Palestinian context or any other is possible, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=220.28s)]
*  you got to bubble wrap the process from the outset, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=224.16s)]
*  because you have to anticipate that the extremists, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  potentially on both sides, are going to try and undermine it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=229.76s)]
*  And that really brought me to terrorism. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=232.64s)]
*  And the PhD looked at terrorist attacks by Hamas, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians, Islamic Jihad, and Jewish extremists [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  like Barak Goldstein attack in Hebron. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=241.88s)]
*  And the timing was good because [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  I had done all this PhD field research [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=250.72s)]
*  in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip in 1997. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Really just a few weeks after the Palestinians [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=256.32s)]
*  came into Gaza, I interviewed people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=259.8s)]
*  that the US government hadn't interviewed yet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=262.2s)]
*  I know because I got calls from parts of the US government [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=264.84s)]
*  saying, hey, you met with people we haven't met with yet. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=267.0s)]
*  What'd you think of them? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  And to make a long story short, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=270.68s)]
*  that led to a job in counterterrorism at the FBI [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=273.08s)]
*  focused on Middle Eastern terrorist groups, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=276.64s)]
*  their activities in the United States, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=279.44s)]
*  and their activities threatening US interests [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=280.8s)]
*  and persons abroad. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  I left the FBI after 9-11. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=285.96s)]
*  I led the analytical team for Flight 175, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=288.4s)]
*  among other things. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=290.8s)]
*  And really wanted to write a book on Hamas [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  and how it basically has not only a terrorist [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=295.36s)]
*  and military wing and a political wing, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=298.4s)]
*  but also a social welfare wing, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=300.12s)]
*  but these are all in service of one another. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  And that was ultimately published by Yale Politics, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=305.36s)]
*  Charity and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=308.88s)]
*  And then just as I decided not to go back into government, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=312.32s)]
*  government came knocking. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=314.8s)]
*  Part of the Intelligence Reform [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=316.76s)]
*  and Terrorism Prevention Act. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=317.8s)]
*  The big thing was creation of DHS. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  The National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=322.2s)]
*  But it also pulled almost all [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=323.84s)]
*  of the law enforcement components, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=325.44s)]
*  everything about IRS criminal investigations [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=326.88s)]
*  out of Treasury, mostly into the new DHS. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=329.08s)]
*  And in that space, Treasury created [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=333.08s)]
*  something called Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=335.0s)]
*  which included a bunch of preexisting components [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=337.36s)]
*  and then also a new Office of Intelligence Analysis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=339.76s)]
*  And I got recruited to be the Deputy Assistant Secretary [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=343.44s)]
*  for Intelligence and Analysis. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=346.44s)]
*  Did that for a while. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=349.44s)]
*  And then went back to the Think Tank role, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=351.32s)]
*  back to the Washington Institute. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=353.08s)]
*  Had my book on Hezbollah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=356.68s)]
*  And I directed the counterterrorism program there [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=359.44s)]
*  and teach at Georgetown and spend, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=362.12s)]
*  take as many opportunities as I can [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=364.8s)]
*  to share a podium with you, mostly to poke fun at you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=367.36s)]
*  because you poke fun at me and it's a lot of fun. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=371.8s)]
*  And frankly, I'm tolerating the whole Iran conversation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  just so we can get to that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=377.44s)]
*  Well, we do like to have fun on this podcast, Matt. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  So we will get to that, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=382.36s)]
*  even though it is a dark and serious topic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=383.4s)]
*  But has anyone read any of your books? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=387.2s)]
*  I mean, have you got readers or? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=389.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, my mom. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=391.44s)]
*  Your mom's read all of them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=392.28s)]
*  I will tell you this much. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=393.56s)]
*  I know I'm doing something right [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=395.24s)]
*  because the then Deputy Secretary General of Hezbollah, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=397.2s)]
*  the current Secretary General, Naim Qasem, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=402.92s)]
*  a couple of years ago, I think it was, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=406.28s)]
*  spent I think it's like 22 minutes talking about me [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=408.0s)]
*  on Hezbollah's Al-Munar television. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=411.76s)]
*  It's a great video clip and he has like pages of notes [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=413.76s)]
*  that I assume some aides prepped him with. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=417.52s)]
*  And he carefully reads his name, Matthew Luit, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=420.52s)]
*  checks his notes again, Matthew Luit, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=424.32s)]
*  and proceeds to tell the audience all the lies I say [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=427.12s)]
*  about Hezbollah and how I'm a shell for the US government. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=429.52s)]
*  And the other way I know I'm onto something is that, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=432.28s)]
*  and I'm sure you'll appreciate, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=434.44s)]
*  every once in a while I get calls from people [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=436.48s)]
*  in positions to know who say, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  just be careful not to click on emails with strange things [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=440.56s)]
*  because there are people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  who are trying to get you click on those. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=448.24s)]
*  I mean, I imagine you would have watched with some interest, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  all the names in your Hezbollah and Hamas book [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  have been systematically taken out by the Israelis. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  So I don't know how many of them are left. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=459.48s)]
*  I've never thought of my books as targeting lists. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=462.04s)]
*  And it's kind of funny only because the latest version [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=465.24s)]
*  of the Hezbollah book came out [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=468.88s)]
*  just before everything started in July [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=471.36s)]
*  with the assassinations of Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Akkal, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=474.96s)]
*  people who were involved in attacks against the CIA [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=479.32s)]
*  in the 1980s, people in the US intelligence community [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=482.2s)]
*  dancing a jig when these people were taken out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=484.8s)]
*  And then of course, Pagers and walkie-talkies and whatnot. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=487.52s)]
*  And so the book is great historical context at this point. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=491.04s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you reminded our listeners about that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=495.76s)]
*  because people forget that Hezbollah has killed [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=499.56s)]
*  and maimed many Americans. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=501.68s)]
*  It's not just Israelis and Middle Easterners, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=503.6s)]
*  but I wanna get to Hezbollah first [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=505.6s)]
*  because I think your book's outstanding. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=509.08s)]
*  Obviously came out in a very timely fashion. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=511.88s)]
*  And Hezbollah is perhaps down, but not out. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=515.12s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the Hezbollah [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=520.48s)]
*  that is still standing after Israel launched, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=522.64s)]
*  I think attacks that impressed me and surprised me. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=526.72s)]
*  I don't know if they surprised you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=530.4s)]
*  and Israel's capabilities and what they did [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=532.2s)]
*  to Hezbollah leadership and Hezbollah networks. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=534.76s)]
*  Who is Hezbollah today after these Israeli strikes? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=539.28s)]
*  So Mark, first of all, anybody who tells you [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=543.32s)]
*  they weren't surprised by what happened since last July [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=544.96s)]
*  is pulling your leg. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=549.96s)]
*  The only people who weren't surprised [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  were the people who've been developing these capabilities [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  And even they, I'm here to tell you, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=556.64s)]
*  were in some way surprised by how effective [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=559.2s)]
*  and successful this series of body blows was. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=562.48s)]
*  So before I answer where they are now, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=568.0s)]
*  I think it's important to understand [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=569.2s)]
*  it's not just a question of taking out key personnel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=570.32s)]
*  It's not just a question of destroying a significant amount [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  of their weaponry. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=578.0s)]
*  It's not just a question of taking out [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=579.28s)]
*  a significant amount of forward deployed weaponry [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  in bunkers and tunnels underground along the blue line, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=584.68s)]
*  separating Lebanon and Israel. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=587.72s)]
*  It's not just a question of literally blowing up [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=590.56s)]
*  huge amounts of cash, US dollars and gold. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=592.88s)]
*  It's really also a question of completely ripping apart [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=598.36s)]
*  their command and control. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=601.64s)]
*  People have referred to this as a, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=603.04s)]
*  an effort to kind of cut off the head of the snake. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=604.6s)]
*  It's not that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=607.6s)]
*  This is like open heart surgery. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=608.44s)]
*  So you're talking about multiple people at the top level, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=610.2s)]
*  multiple people at levels two, three, four, five, six, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=613.36s)]
*  and seven, you take out one person, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=616.0s)]
*  and then three days later, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=619.24s)]
*  the person who was supposed to succeed them, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=620.08s)]
*  and that it's had a tremendously disrupting effect [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=622.0s)]
*  for Hezbollah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  It's gonna take them some time to work on it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=628.52s)]
*  For Hezbollah, it's gonna take them some time [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=631.88s)]
*  to recoup from that if they ever do. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=634.2s)]
*  I don't think the Hezbollah that existed prior to July [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=636.44s)]
*  will exist again, if not for many, many years, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=639.36s)]
*  and only if we make lots of big mistakes. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  But Matt, it's interesting, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  because I just wanna stop you there [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=645.52s)]
*  before we go into more detail. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  There is an argument, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it's been mostly used with Hamas, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=649.64s)]
*  and that is this notion that you can't kill an idea. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=652.6s)]
*  I'm sure you've been hearing about this for decades [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  as you worked on counter-terrorism. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=657.2s)]
*  But what you're saying is you may not be able to kill [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=659.52s)]
*  an idea, but you certainly can demolish the capabilities [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=662.48s)]
*  of a terrorist organization, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=666.0s)]
*  and in doing so, really undermine its effectiveness. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=668.52s)]
*  Look, the basic calculus for understanding threat [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=671.96s)]
*  is intent and capability. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=675.24s)]
*  I would love to be able to address intent, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=677.48s)]
*  but if I can sufficiently address capability, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=680.0s)]
*  I can mitigate the threat significantly. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=682.88s)]
*  Now, we're gonna get to them into your original question. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not completely mitigated. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  There still is a significant threat from Hezbollah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=688.88s)]
*  And then if you can mitigate the threat enough, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=691.36s)]
*  you can create space where there can be changes. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=694.6s)]
*  The Washington Institute conducted a poll [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  in the summer before October 7th. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Just over 70% of Gazans wanted Hamas disarmed, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=703.92s)]
*  did not support Hamas targeting Israel, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  and wanted even the corrupt PA to come back in. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=709.36s)]
*  Hamas controlled the Gaza Strip, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  and yet it wasn't actually winning [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=715.28s)]
*  the battle of ideas and hearts and minds. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=717.48s)]
*  The same with Hezbollah. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=720.0s)]
*  If you look at the air barometer polls that came out, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=721.6s)]
*  Hezbollah wasn't doing so great. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=726.08s)]
*  People were very upset with Hezbollah, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=728.04s)]
*  not only for preventing until recently [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=730.04s)]
*  there being an actual Lebanese government, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=734.36s)]
*  but much more fundamentally for playing a critical role. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=735.96s)]
*  Not, it's not, they don't deserve all the blame, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=738.56s)]
*  but a critical role in the huge economic crisis [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=741.16s)]
*  that continues to face Lebanon. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=745.24s)]
*  So look now, you have now, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=747.84s)]
*  it's not the best thing in the world, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=750.72s)]
*  but you have a ceasefire that Hezbollah had no choice [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=752.24s)]
*  but to agree to. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=754.48s)]
*  You have a president and a prime minister [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=755.32s)]
*  who are not big fans of Hezbollah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=757.32s)]
*  You have a new head of the Lebanese Armed Forces, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=759.44s)]
*  the LAF, similarly, like small baby steps, to be sure, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=761.84s)]
*  lots of imperfections, but a far cry from what was before. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=765.96s)]
*  So all that said, Hezbollah is still a threat, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  because ultimately what the Israelis, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  and I'd say they're still a threat [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=775.6s)]
*  in terms of international terrorism. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=776.92s)]
*  They're still a threat in terms of things domestically [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  within Lebanon, and they're still a threat to Israel, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=781.76s)]
*  mostly in terms of rockets. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=784.64s)]
*  But the Israelis will still be concerned [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=788.4s)]
*  about cross-border raids, not necessarily of hundreds [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=789.68s)]
*  or thousands of people like we saw on October 7th, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=792.76s)]
*  which was the threat people were concerned about [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=795.28s)]
*  from the North for many, many years. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=797.28s)]
*  I've been going up there and Israeli officials saying, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  this is the threat we're preparing to counter [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=802.0s)]
*  against Hezbollah cross-border raid. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=804.04s)]
*  But the fact is Hezbollah has today still thousands [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=807.44s)]
*  upon thousands of rockets, even if it's accurate [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=810.56s)]
*  that the Israelis destroyed some 80% [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=813.84s)]
*  of the most sophisticated rockets [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=816.64s)]
*  and the precision guided munitions, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=818.52s)]
*  which is a tremendously huge achievement, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=820.44s)]
*  20% of thousands is still a not small number. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=824.72s)]
*  And they still have plenty of other smaller, shorter, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=828.6s)]
*  older, dumber rockets that are important, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=833.32s)]
*  mostly in terms of being able to overwhelm [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  even Israel's four tier air defense system. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=837.96s)]
*  Now they can't do something like that for weeks [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=841.08s)]
*  and months and months on end like they once could have, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=844.24s)]
*  but if Hezbollah decided tomorrow to initiate [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=847.6s)]
*  a significant rocket attack on Israel, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=850.6s)]
*  they could do significant damage. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=854.2s)]
*  If Hezbollah operatives decided at some point [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=856.44s)]
*  that they wanted to do some type of cross-border raid, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  maybe like 2006 and grab a couple of people. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=861.28s)]
*  A few months ago, I wrote a piece on Iran's [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=864.4s)]
*  petrochemical weapons program that mostly [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=869.28s)]
*  are fentanyl-based knockout drugs. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=872.76s)]
*  The big concern on the part of the Israelis [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=875.16s)]
*  that was going to be provided to Hezbollah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=876.96s)]
*  Hezbollah uses that to knock out people on the border [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=878.44s)]
*  and either grab their bodies or pass them [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=881.04s)]
*  and go and attack someone. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=882.96s)]
*  That's still a possibility, though much less of a threat [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=883.8s)]
*  than it was because the Israelis [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=886.24s)]
*  are so much better prepared. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=887.32s)]
*  But Hezbollah has no shortage of fighters, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=890.32s)]
*  not necessarily the most, they've lost some very [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=894.12s)]
*  sophisticated fighters, some very experienced fighters, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  but they've got plenty of numbers of people [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=900.2s)]
*  and they've got no shortage of small arms. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=902.24s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest threat [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=905.24s)]
*  actually domestically in Lebanon, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=906.44s)]
*  which is why you're seeing I think the Lebanese government [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=907.88s)]
*  take some good steps, but also trying to be careful [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=909.96s)]
*  in what and how they do. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  As we just saw, Hezbollah kidnapped Syrians [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=914.44s)]
*  from inside Syrian territory and then torture and kill them [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=918.68s)]
*  in an effort to try and pressure [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  the post-Assad Syrian government, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=924.16s)]
*  which is no group of Jeffersonian Democrats, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=926.56s)]
*  but is anti-Iran, anti-Hezbollah, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=930.52s)]
*  and is cutting off the Land and Air Bridge [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=933.64s)]
*  that was Syria before for Iranian weapons. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=937.12s)]
*  You see Hezbollah trying to push back and they could. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=940.4s)]
*  Finally, the one part of Hezbollah [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=943.28s)]
*  where I haven't seen any significant name [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=946.52s)]
*  of someone who has been killed in this campaign [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=949.72s)]
*  is their international terrorist network, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=952.52s)]
*  the Islamic Jihad Organization, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=954.16s)]
*  the External Security Organization, Unit 910. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=955.64s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  They were never huge numbers. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=960.0799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they're more capable, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=964.36s)]
*  but if I were Hezbollah and I've been beaten back so bad, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=966.56s)]
*  I would be really looking for ways to show [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=970.04s)]
*  that I'm not down and out, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=972.28s)]
*  and I would be looking to do that internationally [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=974.88s)]
*  in ways that have some measure [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=977.12s)]
*  of reasonable deniability. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=978.76s)]
*  That is to say it's less likely the Israelis [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=980.64s)]
*  will start bombing the stuffing out of me again over this. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=982.96s)]
*  And then I would also be looking to refill my coffers. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=987.24s)]
*  They lost a tremendous amount of money. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=991.8s)]
*  They lost a lot of infrastructure they can't rebuild. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=993.84s)]
*  Iran is having a much harder time sending money to them, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=996.08s)]
*  trying to send money on flights from Iran, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=998.68s)]
*  which now get inspected, on flights from Iraq, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1000.56s)]
*  which now get inspected. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1002.64s)]
*  Now we're seeing flights from Turkey, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1003.64s)]
*  but one million, two million at a time, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1005.48s)]
*  it's hard to rebuild the millions upon millions [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1008.24s)]
*  upon millions they've lost that way. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1010.4s)]
*  And so I anticipate we're gonna see a lot more [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1012.16s)]
*  of their criminal networks in Africa, in South America, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1014.0s)]
*  leveraging their footprint in the Iraqi economy, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  for example, to try and fill some of that gap. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1021.28s)]
*  So Matt, that's what I really wanna talk to you about [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1025.52s)]
*  is Hezbollah, Inc. International, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1027.12s)]
*  because I think there's been a huge amount of focus, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1029.96s)]
*  as you allude to, in the past year on Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1032.44s)]
*  Hezbollah in Israel, Hezbollah in Syria, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1036.68s)]
*  tend to, with a lot of podcasts, a lot of writing, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1040.76s)]
*  a lot of reports, but Hezbollah International [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1043.4s)]
*  is something that you've focused on for many years. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think you're the leading expert [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1047.76s)]
*  on how Hezbollah operates internationally. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1049.4s)]
*  Give me a minute. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1051.68s)]
*  I think we're done here. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1052.52s)]
*  We're done, you're the leading expert. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1053.3400000000001s)]
*  Now let's bring in your mom, who's read all your books [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1054.28s)]
*  and probably knows more than you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1055.96s)]
*  But you've been tracking them internationally, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1058.28s)]
*  and I'm particularly interested in learning more about that, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  and I'm sure our listeners are as well. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1064.84s)]
*  Give us a sense of the scope of Hezbollah globally, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1066.68s)]
*  and how's the organization, how are they organized, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1070.08s)]
*  where are they? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1074.76s)]
*  Talk a little bit about their presence, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1076.44s)]
*  particularly in Latin America [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1077.72s)]
*  and also in the United States and Canada. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1080.6s)]
*  How much time do you have? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1082.68s)]
*  We've got quite a bit of time, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1083.96s)]
*  and I actually wanna spend quite a bit of time [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  on this podcast talking about this, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1087.32s)]
*  because I think, again, we're gonna get to Hamas, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1089.0s)]
*  we'll get to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1091.76s)]
*  and we're certainly gonna get to Iran [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1093.76s)]
*  and its global network. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1096.64s)]
*  But it's been clear to me for many years [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1097.88s)]
*  that Hezbollah has been operating very successfully, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1101.04s)]
*  very lucratively, as you allude to, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1105.28s)]
*  in places and in jurisdictions [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1108.64s)]
*  where they really represent a significant threat [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1111.02s)]
*  to United States, to Jewish communities, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1113.04s)]
*  to Israeli diplomatic missions, and to local populations. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1116.28s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  and where are we with Hezbollah Global Inc. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  So look, this is where I spend most of my time [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1127.36s)]
*  when it comes to Hezbollah. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1130.16s)]
*  The book, Hezbollah, The Global Footprint [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1131.12s)]
*  of Lebanon's Party of God, really is this, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  and goes kind of mapping around the world. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1135.0s)]
*  And then following off from that, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  we built an interactive map of Hezbollah activity [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1138.44s)]
*  around the world, which is open access and free [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  at Washington Institute's website. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1143.6399999999999s)]
*  And now a podcast, Breaking Hezbollah's Golden Rule. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1146.12s)]
*  And maybe let's start by, I'll just explain that title. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  At one point, there was a Hezbollah operative in New York, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1154.0s)]
*  Ali Karani, who's since been convicted and is in jail. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1158.56s)]
*  Cards on the table, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1161.72s)]
*  I was the government's expert witness in that case. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1162.56s)]
*  And at one point, he asks his handler, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1165.6399999999999s)]
*  who's a more senior Hezbollah international terrorist, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1167.56s)]
*  Hey, what was your role in the Burgess-Bulgaria bus bombing [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
*  and in the failed ammonium nitrate [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1179.46s)]
*  explosive stockpiling plots in Cyprus? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1184.7800000000002s)]
*  And his handler scolds him and says, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1189.3400000000001s)]
*  hey, the golden rule of Hezbollah's Islamic shahad [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1191.5800000000002s)]
*  is the less you know, the better. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1196.5s)]
*  Now he means operational security, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  but it's also true that Hezbollah does lots and lots [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1201.54s)]
*  of things that it wants you to know about. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1204.34s)]
*  It's political activity, it's social welfare activity [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  in Lebanon, it's religious activity, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1209.58s)]
*  it's ideological activity, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1210.9399999999998s)]
*  including it's very, very anti-Israel stances. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1212.1s)]
*  But there are things that really doesn't want you [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  to know about. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1216.78s)]
*  And so this is not just operational security [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1217.62s)]
*  for its operatives. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1219.8999999999999s)]
*  They'd much prefer that people like you and I [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1220.86s)]
*  weren't having this conversation. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1223.3s)]
*  And so the point of the podcast is to break [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1224.94s)]
*  Hezbollah's golden rule. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1229.3400000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah is different than say your Al Qaeda, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1231.5400000000002s)]
*  than your ISIS, because they want to be able [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1233.5s)]
*  to have capabilities to do all kinds of things, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1235.26s)]
*  including kill people, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1237.26s)]
*  but they don't necessarily feel they have to kill people. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1238.66s)]
*  If there's other ways to do what they want to do, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1242.0600000000002s)]
*  that's fine too. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1243.5800000000002s)]
*  But they definitely want to have off the shelf [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1245.5400000000002s)]
*  operational planning in case the leadership decides [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1247.7800000000002s)]
*  that this is something they want to do. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1251.8200000000002s)]
*  The big concern for intelligence and law enforcement [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1253.66s)]
*  in the West in general, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1257.26s)]
*  but specifically here in the United States right now, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1258.18s)]
*  is that the assessment that we've had for many, many years, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1261.6200000000001s)]
*  the fundamental assessment has been Hezbollah [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1266.3400000000001s)]
*  doesn't want to carry out attacks in the United States yet. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1268.7s)]
*  It's never carried out an attack in the United States. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1272.02s)]
*  It's carried out attacks against Americans [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1273.94s)]
*  in Lebanon and abroad, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1275.74s)]
*  but it wants to have the capability [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1278.9s)]
*  and the types of things that would make it consider [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1281.58s)]
*  carrying out these types of attacks. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1286.86s)]
*  We were told by Al-Quran and it came out in his court case, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1289.1799999999998s)]
*  were if the United States was deemed to be directly involved [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1293.1799999999998s)]
*  in a war against Iran or taking out senior Iranian leaders, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1297.34s)]
*  think Qasem Soleimani, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1301.06s)]
*  or directly involved in a war against Hezbollah [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1302.78s)]
*  or helping Israel and something like, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1304.86s)]
*  and he specifically said like killing Hassan Asrella, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1306.6599999999999s)]
*  which obviously has happened to that and much more. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1309.58s)]
*  And so all of the kind of trip wires, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1312.3s)]
*  they're kind of in the rear view mirror now. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1315.78s)]
*  Are you surprised? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1318.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, given that these events have occurred [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1319.26s)]
*  and Hezbollah has not activated its international cells. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1322.46s)]
*  So firstly, you and I don't know what they've activated. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1325.86s)]
*  I remember right after the Qasem Soleimani assassination, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1327.8999999999999s)]
*  a bunch of people in government at the time said to me, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1330.74s)]
*  you see lots of people thought it would be World War III, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1334.02s)]
*  nothing happened. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1336.1399999999999s)]
*  And I remember telling people, stuff's gonna happen, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1337.6599999999999s)]
*  or they're at least gonna try and do stuff. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1341.06s)]
*  Don't think that you kill Qasem Soleimani on Monday [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1343.5s)]
*  and by Thursday, you see what they've done. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1346.9399999999998s)]
*  And in fact, we've seen them trying to kill current [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1350.26s)]
*  and former US government officials [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1352.6599999999999s)]
*  and do other things around the world. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1354.78s)]
*  And they still are trying to do those things [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1356.58s)]
*  to avenge Qasem Soleimani's death. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  We've seen Iran do that directly. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1360.58s)]
*  We've seen Hezbollah do that directly. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1362.9399999999998s)]
*  What, are you making a distinction [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1364.7399999999998s)]
*  between Iran and Hezbollah in that case? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1366.62s)]
*  So in that case, yes. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1368.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that Hezbollah hasn't been involved. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1370.6999999999998s)]
*  We just haven't seen it directly. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1373.1s)]
*  Hezbollah was involved in one instance [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1375.26s)]
*  where they had an opportunity to get information [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1377.58s)]
*  from someone who was then an active duty [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1380.3799999999999s)]
*  US military person in Iraq [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1382.62s)]
*  and provided information to Hezbollah [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1385.1399999999999s)]
*  on people that were involved in that plot. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1388.06s)]
*  And that information was clearly provided to Iran. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1391.3s)]
*  But in these types of international operations, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1394.26s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah have often operated together. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1397.54s)]
*  They've often operated separately. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1400.4199999999998s)]
*  When it comes to Iranian external operations, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1402.82s)]
*  and we have an interactive map of that [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1405.1399999999999s)]
*  on the website now too, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1406.74s)]
*  the biggest modus operandi, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1408.54s)]
*  which now Hezbollah is following, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1411.5s)]
*  is to recruit non-terrorist, non-Iranian, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1414.1s)]
*  non-Lebanese criminals. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1418.22s)]
*  We see this just in recent days, right? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1422.06s)]
*  There's a trial in Southern District of New York [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1425.1s)]
*  on the murder-for-hire trial [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1427.54s)]
*  targeting Masih Al-Najad, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1429.78s)]
*  a very famous and very outspoken Iranian dissident. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1431.82s)]
*  I was there just recently listening to court proceedings [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1435.58s)]
*  and it was quite chilling and quite harrowing. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1440.5s)]
*  You've been, I think, involved with that trial as well, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1443.98s)]
*  correct? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1446.5s)]
*  I was the expert witness for that trial [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1447.58s)]
*  and didn't have to testify because the defense stipulated [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1451.34s)]
*  to the things I had to say, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1455.26s)]
*  I guess rather than have me get up there and do it myself. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1457.22s)]
*  But that's an example, I guess, in that case that, yeah, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1460.8999999999999s)]
*  was it a Russian mob recruiting Azerbaijanis? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1463.74s)]
*  Two former Soviet Union Republic gangs of thieves, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1468.3799999999999s)]
*  criminals. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1477.78s)]
*  At least one of them was a Zary. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1479.62s)]
*  And then having someone on the ground who, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1482.82s)]
*  unfortunately for them, the FBI caught and flipped [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1485.58s)]
*  and he pled guilty and testified against these two guys [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1489.6599999999999s)]
*  who were effectively his bosses. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1492.54s)]
*  But that's the model you're talking about, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1494.06s)]
*  which is essentially Iran and or Hezbollah [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1495.3799999999999s)]
*  recruiting non-Iranian, non-Lebanese. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1498.58s)]
*  I think in the Lebanese case, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1501.1799999999998s)]
*  so I guess it's almost a couple of years now in Brazil, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1503.1799999999998s)]
*  recruiting local Brazilian criminals, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1506.1s)]
*  paying for them to have kind of vacations to Lebanon [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1510.1399999999999s)]
*  where people could then vet them and send them in the back. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1513.1s)]
*  But they were not necessarily Muslim, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1515.58s)]
*  not necessarily Shia, not Arab. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1520.34s)]
*  They were doing it for the money. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1524.26s)]
*  It's in plots targeting in that case Israelis and Jews. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1526.46s)]
*  We've seen also biker gangs and drug cartels [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1530.3s)]
*  and others involved in these. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1533.3799999999999s)]
*  Especially on the Iran side. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1535.3s)]
*  On the Iran side. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1536.62s)]
*  It's just another version of the reasonable deniability, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1538.9s)]
*  trying to have a little bit more distance. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1542.66s)]
*  And sometimes it's even a cutout of a cutout [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1545.02s)]
*  we've seen in Sweden, the Iranians hiring Foxtrot [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1546.98s)]
*  or other criminal networks who then in turn, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1551.98s)]
*  provide a improvised explosive grenade to a 14 year old kid [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1556.1s)]
*  and say, here's a little bit of money, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1560.58s)]
*  go throw it over that wall, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1561.78s)]
*  which happens to be the wall of the Israeli embassy. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1562.9s)]
*  And when law enforcement shows up, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  what they've got is a 14 year old [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1568.66s)]
*  who threw something over [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1569.9s)]
*  and they get to trace it back to the criminals [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1571.3000000000002s)]
*  and then trace that back to Iran, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1572.9s)]
*  which you and I sitting here [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  may sound fairly straightforward, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1576.6200000000001s)]
*  but when you're an investigator, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1578.74s)]
*  it's not following that type of, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1580.5s)]
*  getting that type of information. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1582.6200000000001s)]
*  In any event, Hezbollah does have networks around the world. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1584.74s)]
*  Sometimes it's people that they've sent around the world. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1589.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't like the term sleeper cell, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1592.1s)]
*  but Ali Karani in New York, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1593.6599999999999s)]
*  he used it to describe himself and others. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1595.1s)]
*  And it wasn't the only case there, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1600.78s)]
*  Alexei Saab also in New York, some other cases. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1601.82s)]
*  And they were doing real surveillance. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1604.78s)]
*  They were doing surveillance of secret service, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1606.5s)]
*  FBI and military offices in New York. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1608.98s)]
*  They were doing surveillance of Israelis in New York. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1611.94s)]
*  They were doing surveillance of JFK [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1616.4199999999998s)]
*  and Pearson International airports in New York City [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1618.94s)]
*  and in Toronto. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1622.26s)]
*  They were looking for storage facilities [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1624.22s)]
*  they could rent for small arms or other things, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1626.46s)]
*  looking into networks where they could procure small arms. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1630.14s)]
*  Ali Karani became a US citizen fraudulently [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1633.54s)]
*  and then got a passport [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1638.8200000000002s)]
*  and immediately applies for a visa to China [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1640.5s)]
*  because Hezbollah had him go out there [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1643.54s)]
*  to the largest factory in the world [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1645.8200000000002s)]
*  that makes ice packs. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1648.42s)]
*  Those disposable ice packs, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1650.8600000000001s)]
*  see if your kid twists their ankle in soccer practice [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1651.94s)]
*  and you break the membrane and shake it up [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1654.7s)]
*  and it gets really cold for 20 minutes. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1656.9s)]
*  Well, if you don't break that membrane in each side [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1658.8200000000002s)]
*  and you take that chemical material [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1661.1000000000001s)]
*  and combine it with some other stuff [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1663.22s)]
*  that's publicly available, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1665.5s)]
*  you've got most of what you need [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1666.5400000000002s)]
*  to make an ammonium nitrate bomb. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1667.42s)]
*  And that's been a modus operandi [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1668.7800000000002s)]
*  of Hezbollah around the world. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1670.74s)]
*  We even had a Hezbollah ammonium nitrate case [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1671.5800000000002s)]
*  in Houston, Texas. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  And the State Department has revealed across Europe [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1675.1s)]
*  and we've had cases in Thailand, really around the world. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1678.5s)]
*  And there's no evidence that Ali Karani succeeded [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1682.58s)]
*  in going there to negotiate a bulk discount purchase, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1686.34s)]
*  but that's what he went there for, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1689.58s)]
*  according to investigators. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1690.78s)]
*  He came up with a cover story that really held no water. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1693.86s)]
*  I met a guy, I traveled with his son. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1697.78s)]
*  We traveled 20 something hours together, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1700.66s)]

*  Didn't face value, it fell apart. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1704.66s)]
*  More frequently you see Hezbollah [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1709.02s)]
*  engage in criminal fundraising. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1711.74s)]

*  Money laundering for cartels. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1718.42s)]
*  Some very unsophisticated stuff, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1722.5800000000002s)]
*  some extremely sophisticated stuff. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1724.8600000000001s)]
*  Some things by low level people [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1727.22s)]
*  who don't have a lot of money [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1729.74s)]

*  who are millionaires and provide not only direct funding, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1738.22s)]
*  but provide their networks to Hezbollah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1742.98s)]
*  So now this is important to understand. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1744.9s)]
*  I mean, I think for our listeners, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1746.1000000000001s)]
*  many of them probably appreciate this, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1747.3000000000002s)]
*  but Iran has been giving Hezbollah [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1748.94s)]
*  annually estimates 700 million a year, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1751.74s)]
*  maybe up to a billion dollars a year. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1754.22s)]
*  But Hezbollah is also a organization [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1756.22s)]
*  that doesn't wanna be wholly dependent on Iran. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1761.54s)]
*  So it's created these independent streams [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1763.34s)]
*  of self financing around the world. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1765.98s)]
*  This is what you're referring to. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1767.38s)]
*  This was always the case. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1769.5s)]
*  Hezbollah was always one of the groups [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1770.7s)]
*  that was more engaged in criminal activity [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1772.1000000000001s)]
*  than most terrorist organizations, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1773.94s)]
*  but it was largely not kind of at an institutional level. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1775.26s)]
*  It was just, let's have our people, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1778.8600000000001s)]
*  whenever you're out there and you can, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1779.82s)]
*  sure, do that type of stuff. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1780.9s)]
*  I think a big turning point came in 2009 [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1782.78s)]
*  when the Green Revolution was going on domestically [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1786.42s)]
*  within Iran, US and international sanctions [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1790.5s)]
*  were really beginning to bite again [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1794.3s)]
*  and a sharp drop in the price of oil [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1796.54s)]
*  all came around at the same time and the stars aligned. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1798.86s)]
*  And you had a situation where it's not clear how long, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1802.58s)]
*  but for a period of time, more than days or weeks, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1805.18s)]
*  but probably not much more than some months, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1808.06s)]
*  Iran had to cut back its funding for Hezbollah [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1811.5s)]
*  by as much, we're told, as 40%. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1814.74s)]
*  If you're Hezbollah and you're trying to create [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1818.1399999999999s)]
*  a culture of resistance, their term, not mine, in Lebanon, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  you'd much rather be told by Iran, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1824.6599999999999s)]
*  look, I'm really sorry, no rockets this month. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1825.98s)]
*  Okay, you don't wanna have this huge budget shortfall [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1828.62s)]
*  and they actually had to shut offices, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1834.4199999999998s)]
*  combine office space, cut back salaries to people. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1835.98s)]
*  That's a real crisis for Hezbollah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1839.74s)]
*  Now, the funding went back up and then some, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1842.4199999999998s)]
*  but it was a real wake-up moment for Hezbollah [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1845.62s)]
*  and they realized they needed to diversify [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1848.46s)]
*  their income portfolios. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1850.06s)]
*  And so they went to all kinds of international crime. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1851.54s)]
*  And then we saw just shortly thereafter, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1855.58s)]
*  just a few years later, now that they had these types [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1858.26s)]
*  of networks, in particular in Europe and Eastern Europe, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1861.26s)]
*  that were engaged in all of these economic crimes [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1866.46s)]
*  and financial schemes, they then leveraged many of those [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1869.98s)]
*  to reach out to other elements within their criminal [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1874.46s)]
*  networks for arms procurement. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1877.78s)]
*  Because at the time, the Iranians were providing Hezbollah [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1880.06s)]
*  with all kinds of cheap knockoff weapons. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1883.78s)]
*  And for their special forces, Hezbollah wanted the real thing. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1887.26s)]
*  Right, they wanted M10s, they wanted AR-15s, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1891.06s)]
*  they had specific things they wanted [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1893.18s)]
*  and they got those through some of the same networks, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1895.38s)]
*  which by the way, provided openings for the drug [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1899.9s)]
*  enforcement administration and others to go in undercover [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1903.3s)]
*  or pretending to be, I don't know, in some cases, FARC, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1906.94s)]
*  and we'll give weapons for drugs, drugs for weapons [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1910.62s)]
*  and Hezbollah fell into that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1915.1s)]
*  In a few cases, the US has been able to extradite [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1916.94s)]
*  some of these deep pocket donors, Qasem Tajeddin, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1919.46s)]
*  Mohammed Bazi to the United States. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1924.14s)]
*  In those two cases, not on material support charges, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1926.9s)]
*  but because they were designated by the US Treasury Department [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1930.7s)]
*  and then engaged in sanctions evasion [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1933.94s)]
*  and on sanctions evasion charges [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1936.3400000000001s)]
*  were brought to the United States. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1938.94s)]
*  Both of them served some time in jail. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1940.94s)]
*  Mohammed Bazi, I think just this week, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1942.94s)]
*  was released on time served, about two years, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1945.7s)]
*  time served and a huge fine, I understand. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1948.8600000000001s)]
*  Qasem Tajeddin was released on the context of COVID [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1952.02s)]
*  officially on humanitarian grounds, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1955.66s)]
*  but we were able to get an American [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1958.02s)]
*  who was being wrongfully detained in Lebanon [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1960.14s)]
*  released around the same time. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1963.34s)]
*  So released and sent back to Lebanon? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1964.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1967.1s)]
*  In both cases? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1967.94s)]
*  I don't know if both cases they were sent back to Lebanon. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1969.26s)]
*  Both of them are nationals of several countries, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1971.54s)]
*  including countries in Africa. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1974.06s)]
*  So I don't know if they were sent back to Lebanon [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1975.74s)]
*  or to the countries where they hold citizenship in Africa. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1977.42s)]
*  But they're not wandering around New York City? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1980.14s)]
*  No, they're not in the United States. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1981.7s)]
*  Okay, just to clarify. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1982.54s)]
*  This is a very, very nervous look on your face right now. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1984.42s)]
*  I had a very nervous look on my face. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1986.58s)]
*  I got your back. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1987.7s)]
*  Well, this actually, thank you. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1988.9s)]
*  This points to my longtime concern [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1991.42s)]
*  about Hezbollah and the United States. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1996.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, we'll get to Latin America, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1997.9s)]
*  we'll get to Africa and other places around the world, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=1999.38s)]
*  but there has been a, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2001.7s)]
*  and you've mentioned this a couple of times now. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2005.42s)]
*  I mean, there are networks of Hezbollah cells here, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2007.14s)]
*  the surveillance you talked about in New York City, Toronto. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2012.02s)]
*  I remember a case about surveillance in Chicago. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2016.26s)]
*  I mean, surveillance, for example, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2021.66s)]
*  federal buildings goes back decades. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2022.7s)]
*  The FBI at the time, this is a long time ago now, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2025.7s)]
*  assessed that this was not surveillance [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2028.14s)]
*  for the purpose of carrying out an attack [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2029.98s)]
*  or even primarily off the shelf planning, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2032.1s)]
*  but it was to test new recruits [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2035.66s)]
*  to see if they could not draw attention to themselves. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2039.14s)]
*  But two things. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2043.26s)]
*  One, you then have this off the shelf planning, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2044.26s)]
*  whether or not that's just an added benefit or not. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2046.62s)]
*  And second, these recruits here in the United States [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2049.18s)]
*  were being recruited to do financial schemes, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2052.02s)]
*  to procure dual use items like night vision goggles [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2054.62s)]
*  or whatnot, right? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2057.94s)]
*  The way you're gonna test them [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2059.18s)]
*  is to see if they can do surveillance [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2061.58s)]
*  of a federal building. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2062.98s)]
*  Maybe that's like the ultimate test for these guys, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2063.82s)]
*  but at the end of the day, they had that surveillance. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2066.34s)]
*  And we've got a whole bunch of cases now [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2071.14s)]
*  that are out in the open source [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2073.22s)]
*  where Hezbollah operatives carried out surveillance [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2075.2999999999997s)]
*  of a very wide range of targets and bridges and buildings [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2078.06s)]
*  and locations where there are Jews, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2082.1s)]
*  locations where there might be Israelis, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2084.7s)]
*  locations where it's just non-Jewish or Israeli Americans, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2087.06s)]
*  so that we know that this is something that they do [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2091.9399999999996s)]
*  here in this country. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2095.8199999999997s)]
*  And the concern is it's not like in the movies [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2096.98s)]
*  where they have to send some highly trained operative [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2098.8199999999997s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2101.98s)]
*  What they're gonna do is rely on people who are here. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2103.06s)]
*  People go back home to Lebanon, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2106.5s)]
*  perfectly law abiding Lebanese Americans. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2109.22s)]
*  Like anybody whose family comes from another country, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2112.7400000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2116.38s)]
*  You go back home for the summer [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2117.22s)]
*  so people can see grandma and grandpa [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2120.02s)]
*  and meet their cousins and know the culture, right? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2122.34s)]
*  Absolutely nothing wrong with that. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2125.62s)]
*  But people were able to say, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2127.5s)]
*  oh, I went back for summer vacation [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2128.46s)]
*  and maybe dad when he was there got some training. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2130.66s)]
*  Alexei Saab, the other case in New York [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2133.1s)]
*  who was convicted for getting military training [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2136.62s)]
*  with Hezbollah, a foreign terrorist organization, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2138.54s)]
*  he was living here. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2140.98s)]
*  He was, I think a computer programmer, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2142.42s)]
*  but he'd go back and he'd get updated training from them. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2144.58s)]
*  And he wasn't necessarily doing that while he was here, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2147.94s)]
*  but he kept going back to get updating training [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2151.42s)]
*  and that does make us concerned. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2153.98s)]
*  And so there's a real focus right now given world events [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2156.7400000000002s)]
*  on being very on top of who are these people [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2163.78s)]
*  and the Bureau, the FBI in particular [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2169.1800000000003s)]
*  is really pretty animated on this. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2171.98s)]
*  Well, you said, given world events, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2174.58s)]
*  I mean, 2025 seems to me, Matt, I wonder if you agree, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2176.62s)]
*  it's gonna be potentially a big year on the Iran file. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2180.98s)]
*  There's no way it can be. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2185.7400000000002s)]
*  And you mentioned that Iran has always thought of Hezbollah [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2187.7000000000003s)]
*  as the sort of in its back pocket to be used to both deter [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2192.98s)]
*  and then to respond to any potential US or Israeli attack [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2200.1s)]
*  on, for example, Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2203.26s)]
*  So- Yeah, Israeli or anybody else's [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2205.1800000000003s)]
*  and the main way they would do that was through [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2207.02s)]
*  the Iranian missile and rocket program, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2210.54s)]
*  which is now a fraction of the size. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2213.94s)]
*  Iran really doesn't have that anymore [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2216.7000000000003s)]
*  in terms of Hezbollah rockets. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2218.98s)]
*  Again, Hezbollah could fire rockets in Israel, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2220.58s)]
*  but at this point it's the type of thing [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2222.78s)]
*  that Israel can certainly survive. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2223.94s)]
*  It's not the same kind of level of deterrent, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2227.18s)]
*  which suggests not that that goes away, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2229.94s)]
*  but that it's gonna be that if you're the Iranians, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2232.62s)]
*  you wanna compliment that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2235.58s)]
*  If you're the Iranians in Hezbollah, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2237.02s)]
*  you wanna build up your capability [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2238.2200000000003s)]
*  to do some other things right now. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2239.5s)]
*  We already see the administration taking [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2242.06s)]
*  a much more aggressive stance on the Houthis. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2244.7799999999997s)]
*  On the Iran nuclear file, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2248.7799999999997s)]
*  the president sent a letter, gave a two month deadline. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2251.58s)]
*  That makes all the sense in the world [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2256.66s)]
*  because you have a snap back deadline in October, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2258.22s)]
*  which means for all intents and purposes, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2262.94s)]
*  US and Europeans are gonna be very, very seriously [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2265.14s)]
*  talking about this by July. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2268.14s)]
*  So here we are, March, the two months makes some sense. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2271.18s)]
*  No matter how you slice it on the proxies, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2275.2599999999998s)]
*  on malign regional activity, look at, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2278.54s)]
*  I see recent events in Syria as Iran's Vietnam. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2281.4199999999996s)]
*  They invested so heavily in Syria. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2284.8999999999996s)]
*  And so far, they've been kicked out. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2287.94s)]
*  And then of course, the nuclear file, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2291.8599999999997s)]
*  all these things I think come to some type of a head, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2294.06s)]
*  certainly peak within the first year [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2298.26s)]
*  of the Trump administration. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2303.26s)]
*  So Matt, what I hear you saying is, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2305.0200000000004s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis have done a remarkable job [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2306.1000000000004s)]
*  of severely degrading Hezbollah's capabilities in Lebanon, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2309.0200000000004s)]
*  Amassas capabilities in Gaza, Assad has fallen. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2312.6600000000003s)]
*  The Iranians have lost support of a close ally [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2316.46s)]
*  and a land bridge for getting weapons and men and money [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2320.1800000000003s)]
*  into Lebanon to replenish and rebuild Hezbollah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2324.1s)]
*  And the United States is finally taking it to the Houthis. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2328.42s)]
*  We'll see if they continue this at the same level [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2331.62s)]
*  of intensity and most importantly, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2334.34s)]
*  if they go after the Iranian spy ships and ports [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2335.94s)]
*  and commanders who are supporting the Houthis. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2339.34s)]
*  The Israelis obviously on the West Bank, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2342.06s)]
*  West Bank's always a big concern. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2343.42s)]
*  I'm sure you're watching it closely. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2345.2999999999997s)]
*  But if Iran has any capabilities left, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2347.06s)]
*  it's really one on the nuclear side, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2351.02s)]
*  the fear that they may actually break out [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2353.42s)]
*  or sneak out to a nuclear weapon. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2355.86s)]
*  And second, it's this global network [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2357.7400000000002s)]
*  that they've established of both Hezbollah [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2360.7000000000003s)]
*  and Iranian assets and Iranian affiliates. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2363.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's shift for a bit from the Hezbollah's global footprint [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2370.46s)]
*  to Iran's global footprint. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2374.02s)]
*  And you said that there's a lot of sort of complementarity [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2376.06s)]
*  between the two, but I'm sure there's also [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2378.78s)]
*  a distinct Iranian network. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2380.98s)]
*  You wanna talk a little bit about that? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2384.1s)]
*  And you mentioned this project that you've got. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2385.2200000000003s)]
*  There is, but I'm gonna allow myself a segue. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2386.86s)]
*  And that is in between, there is a trend now [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2388.66s)]
*  that we've seen both with Iran and with Hezbollah, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2391.46s)]
*  both in operations where they come do things together [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2393.86s)]
*  and separate operations, where they are deploying operatives [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2396.2200000000003s)]
*  who are dual nationals and who are not Iranian [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2401.82s)]
*  and are not Lebanese. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2406.98s)]
*  I'm not talking about the criminal operatives right now. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2408.22s)]
*  I'm talking about people who developed relationships, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2411.14s)]
*  Shia militants from different parts of the world [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2415.22s)]
*  who developed relationships in places like Iraq and Syria. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2417.4599999999996s)]
*  So we've seen cases with Pakistani Shia, with Afghani Shia, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2421.58s)]
*  with Iraqi Shia, with Azeri Shia [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2426.3799999999997s)]
*  in different places around the world, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2430.18s)]
*  from Colombia to the case we were just talking about, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2431.74s)]
*  to New York, to Germany, really around the world. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2435.02s)]
*  A former Iranian IRGC official referred to this [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2442.82s)]
*  as Iran's fighters without borders. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2445.78s)]
*  And so this is another theme that people have been [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2449.02s)]
*  kind of focused on quite carefully. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2452.3s)]
*  As you segue beyond Hezbollah operations, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2456.26s)]
*  beyond these kinds of hybrid operations of sending people, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2458.98s)]
*  whether it's Iran sending them or Hezbollah sending them, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2463.14s)]
*  but who are neither Hezbollah group members [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2465.3799999999997s)]
*  or Iranian Quds Force members, but just Shia militants [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2468.14s)]
*  who follow the same worldview of, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2472.2999999999997s)]
*  well, they have to tell Faki, the rule is jurisprudent. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2474.3799999999997s)]
*  You then have actual Iranian operations. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2477.46s)]
*  Now for a period of, let me back up. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2480.18s)]
*  Iran has been carrying out external operations, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2482.2599999999998s)]
*  assassinations, abductions, intimidation, surveillance [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2485.02s)]
*  to support all of that since just a few months [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2489.46s)]
*  after the 1970 and nine revolution. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2491.78s)]
*  In fact, one of the first cases was in Bethesda, Maryland, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2493.82s)]
*  not too many miles from where we're sitting right now. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2497.26s)]
*  One thing that we see in the data set that we've created, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2501.1400000000003s)]
*  which is represented in this online map [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2504.26s)]
*  at the Washington Institute's website, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2506.86s)]
*  is that this is something that they've done [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2508.6600000000003s)]
*  fairly consistently over time, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2511.0600000000004s)]
*  actually really consistently over time with one exception. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2513.0600000000004s)]
*  And that is a bunch of months right after 9-11. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2516.6200000000003s)]
*  And then they went back to it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2521.1s)]
*  I also, I went into this with a few like, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2523.02s)]
*  let's come up with some interesting hypotheses [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2525.1s)]
*  and see if they would work. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2526.8599999999997s)]
*  One of them was, I thought we would see a lot more [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2527.74s)]
*  operations in places in third world countries [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2530.06s)]
*  and places with relatively lax law enforcement, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2532.62s)]
*  border security and all that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2535.7799999999997s)]
*  And we do, we saw things in Africa, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2536.8199999999997s)]
*  we saw things in South America, some of them quite big. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2538.7s)]
*  But actually when you bar graph it out, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2542.14s)]
*  overall and certainly over the last decade, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2545.14s)]
*  far and away the two biggest, three biggest bars, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2548.82s)]
*  Europe, North America, Middle East. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2552.14s)]
*  And by far the biggest is Europe, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2555.06s)]
*  which suggests that they're not afraid [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2557.94s)]
*  to go where the targets are. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2560.34s)]
*  They're not intimidated by, you know, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2562.42s)]
*  first world, highly capable law enforcement [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2567.1s)]
*  intelligence services. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2569.9s)]
*  And if you look at the chronology of these incidents, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2571.9s)]
*  it also shows that they're not intimidated [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2574.82s)]
*  from doing things, not only in places that are sensitive, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2579.26s)]
*  but in times that are sensitive. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2582.1800000000003s)]
*  So in negotiations over the JCPOA, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2584.02s)]
*  fast forward to the beginning of the Biden administration, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2586.94s)]
*  negotiations over a potential JCPOA 2.0, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2588.98s)]
*  and they're plotting things in France. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2592.94s)]
*  I can't tell you by the way, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2596.26s)]
*  if that's just how stubborn and brave they are, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2597.5s)]
*  or it's just as likely there's a left-hand right-hand [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2601.86s)]
*  within the Iranian bureaucracy. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2605.02s)]
*  There's a lot of cooperation [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2606.7000000000003s)]
*  between their security services. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2608.1s)]
*  There's a lot of tension there too. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2609.38s)]
*  There is, but I mean, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2611.26s)]
*  I wanna ask you about the Supreme Leader's role there, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2612.1s)]
*  because it would seem to me [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2613.7400000000002s)]
*  that if the Iranians are engaged in negotiations [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2615.38s)]
*  on one hand, on the other hand, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2618.34s)]
*  the IGC and the Quds Force [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2619.6600000000003s)]
*  and the Ministry of Intelligence are engaged [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2620.98s)]
*  in terror plots in Europe, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2622.58s)]
*  that the Supreme Leader would know that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2626.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's a big maybe. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2629.02s)]
*  That is a very logical conclusion. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2632.18s)]
*  I could also see a situation where the Supreme Leader [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2634.3799999999997s)]
*  doesn't wanna know everything, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2638.14s)]
*  and actually wouldn't mind it [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2640.02s)]
*  if negotiations are continuing over here [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2641.66s)]
*  and the West gets some pressure over there. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2644.02s)]
*  I can't look deep into his eyes [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2648.18s)]
*  and understand his inner soul. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2649.74s)]
*  I lack that skill. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2651.4199999999996s)]
*  But what we do know is that there was enough competition, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2652.9799999999996s)]
*  for example, between these security [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2657.2599999999998s)]
*  and intelligence agencies within Iran [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2660.14s)]
*  right after the 2009 revolution, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2662.2599999999998s)]
*  where the government said, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2664.22s)]
*  knock heads, meaning Iranian heads, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2665.9s)]
*  the sniper go up on a roof and put a bullet [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2668.7799999999997s)]
*  in an Iranian female university students head, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2670.46s)]
*  which happened. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2673.18s)]
*  The MOIS, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2675.62s)]
*  kind of their CIA, if you will, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2678.5s)]
*  was a little less comfortable with that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2680.18s)]
*  And the IRGC in particular, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2681.8599999999997s)]
*  their Basij militia said, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2683.2999999999997s)]
*  you do what you gotta do. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2685.1s)]
*  That actually, we understand kind of, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2686.62s)]
*  the IRGC went up a few notches [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2688.9s)]
*  and the MOIS down a few notches. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2690.98s)]
*  And it's shortly after that, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2692.54s)]
*  that you have the founding [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2694.3s)]
*  of the IRGC intelligence organization, the IRGCIO. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2695.14s)]
*  Now there's more cooperation, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2699.54s)]
*  but also tension between MOIS [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2701.82s)]
*  and the IRGC's own intelligence organization. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2703.98s)]
*  I envision, and I tell people all the time, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2706.42s)]
*  go back and read the indictment of poor Safi, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2708.62s)]
*  the guy who's involved in the attempted plot [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2711.6600000000003s)]
*  against Ambassador Bolton. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2714.3s)]
*  You read that and I come away with this feeling [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2716.78s)]
*  of like, there's this, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2719.7000000000003s)]
*  each unit, each agency wants to be the one to do [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2721.6200000000003s)]
*  what the big boss man wants. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2726.82s)]
*  Not that agency, but my agency, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2728.5800000000004s)]
*  not that office, but my office. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2731.46s)]
*  Poor Safi is told, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2734.02s)]
*  look, I'm not sure I can do this with deniability. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2734.86s)]
*  Just do it, just do it, he says. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2737.0600000000004s)]
*  So we can't really answer exactly where the soul is. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2740.98s)]
*  And maybe the Supreme Leader is absolutely pulling [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2745.02s)]
*  all the strings and knowledgeable about all of it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2747.74s)]
*  And it's all very intentional. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2749.78s)]
*  Having worked in the US government, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2751.82s)]
*  I can tell you we have left-hand, right-hand things [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2754.14s)]
*  all the time. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2758.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's not the case that senior people are aware [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2759.34s)]
*  of each piece of what's going on. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2762.2599999999998s)]
*  And we also know that within Iran, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2764.2599999999998s)]
*  there's a little bit of a culture of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2765.42s)]
*  better to ask forgiveness later than permission now. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2767.86s)]
*  There's a lot of rewarding people for taking initiative. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2770.7799999999997s)]
*  If you remember years ago now, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2776.3799999999997s)]
*  when the RGC Navy grabbed a bunch of British soldiers [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2777.8199999999997s)]
*  in the Shatel Rabbit, it's quite clear now [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2780.7s)]
*  that was not planned. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2782.8999999999996s)]
*  No one gave them the authority to do that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2784.4599999999996s)]
*  No one told them to do it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2786.3399999999997s)]
*  A bunch of people did it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2787.18s)]
*  It didn't work out so well, made them, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2788.02s)]
*  they didn't look so great. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2789.18s)]
*  And rumor is it that those guys got promoted. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2790.3399999999997s)]
*  So I can't tell you exactly what the decision-making [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2792.9799999999996s)]
*  is in all of this, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2796.4599999999996s)]
*  but what I can tell you is what the data shows [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2797.2999999999997s)]
*  is that at the end of the day, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2799.78s)]
*  they are aggressive in places, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2801.78s)]
*  even in places and in times that are sensitive. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2803.78s)]
*  Now, if you look at the, what was that? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2806.5400000000004s)]
*  I think the 2018 plot outside of Paris targeting [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2809.1400000000003s)]
*  an MEK rally where lots of current and former [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2812.2200000000003s)]
*  US officials were gonna be, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2814.98s)]
*  and they were gonna plant a bomb, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2816.5800000000004s)]
*  so scenes out of a movie where they literally [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2819.1400000000003s)]
*  shut down sections of the Autobahn in Germany [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2822.2200000000003s)]
*  to arrest this diplomat who gets extradited to Belgium [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2824.42s)]
*  and is tried and is convicted [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2827.9s)]
*  and the Iranians do what they do, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2829.7000000000003s)]
*  which is arrest a Belgian citizen saying [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2830.94s)]
*  he's a spy when he wasn't. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2835.34s)]
*  And of course, well, we're happy to negotiate with you, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2836.54s)]
*  but you got to release our guy, which is what happened. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2838.1800000000003s)]
*  After that plot, which involved actual Iranian diplomats [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2841.9s)]
*  and some other Iranian agents, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2845.3s)]
*  the Iranians seem since then to have backed away [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2847.38s)]
*  from using their own agents. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2849.96s)]
*  And that's when you really start seeing them [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2852.1800000000003s)]
*  deploying criminals. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2854.9s)]
*  Who are in it for the money. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2858.7400000000002s)]
*  And the results aren't as guaranteed, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2860.9s)]
*  but you can kind of throw paint at the wall [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2865.02s)]
*  and see what sticks. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2867.1s)]
*  But let me ask you this, Matt, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2868.26s)]
*  because at the end of the day, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2869.26s)]
*  what you talked about throughout this podcast [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2870.46s)]
*  are indictments, sometimes convictions, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2873.1800000000003s)]
*  sanctions, designations, and yet the Iranians, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2876.34s)]
*  the regime and Hezbollah have really operated [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2880.34s)]
*  with relative impunity in Europe. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2883.14s)]
*  And certainly in Latin America and Africa [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2885.86s)]
*  and around the world, you suggest that there is some level [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2888.98s)]
*  of caution when it comes to operating the United States, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2892.82s)]
*  that they're here, they're doing what they're doing, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2897.06s)]
*  but they're careful. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2899.58s)]
*  What is the right response? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2902.38s)]
*  I mean, we started the podcast by talking about [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2903.94s)]
*  Israel's amazing capabilities and success [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2906.42s)]
*  against Hezbollah in the Middle East. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2911.62s)]
*  The Israelis were not indicting, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2914.06s)]
*  they were not designating, they were not sanctioning, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2915.5s)]
*  they were killing, they were blowing things up. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2918.58s)]
*  How many more court cases, how many more expert witnesses, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2923.42s)]
*  how many more sanctions are we going to level [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2929.34s)]
*  until the West wakes up to a reality [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2932.42s)]
*  that that doesn't seem to be deterring [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2934.82s)]
*  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2937.98s)]
*  from conducting these operations around the world. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2940.9s)]
*  Some of which have been deadly [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2943.9s)]
*  and some of which could be very deadly going forward. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2946.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and some of them we just got lucky. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2948.86s)]
*  So look, I don't think you presented it as an either or, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2952.5s)]
*  and I don't think it is. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2956.5s)]
*  For so many decades now, certainly since 9 11, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2957.98s)]
*  when we're talking about all elements of national power, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2960.62s)]
*  this is an area where we don't do that. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2963.2200000000003s)]
*  I've written and lectured widely on the fact [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2967.1s)]
*  that we are not going to indict and sanction our way [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2970.06s)]
*  out of this problem alone. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2972.42s)]
*  And without meaning to be too pithy on the question [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2973.9s)]
*  of Iranian external operations specifically, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2976.86s)]
*  the reason they keep doing it is because they can [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  and because the cost is really pretty acceptable. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2983.2200000000003s)]
*  What do they have to fear in Europe? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2986.54s)]
*  I mean, what are the Europeans going to do about it? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2987.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's a question of what have they done [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2989.82s)]
*  and the answer is not very much. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2992.54s)]
*  It's beginning to change the Brits, the Germans, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2995.14s)]
*  the French, the Swedes, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=2999.06s)]
*  there have been a bunch of plots in Sweden, the Belgians. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3001.46s)]
*  There's a lot more focus right now on state level threats. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3005.46s)]
*  They put this in a Russia, China, Iran basket. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3009.7s)]
*  The EUs, I think every five years they come out [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3015.1s)]
*  with their serious organized crime. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3018.8999999999996s)]
*  Unclassified paper came out this week, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3023.1s)]
*  points at this as well in terms of the use [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3027.14s)]
*  of these criminals by states. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3029.14s)]
*  And there is a lot more appetite now for doing more. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3031.3399999999997s)]
*  My feeling is absolutely we should be sanctioning. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3035.8599999999997s)]
*  We should be designating. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3039.18s)]
*  We should also by the way, be enforcing those. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3041.22s)]
*  So it's great to add more entities to our various lists, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3044.62s)]
*  but we need to act on those enforcement actions. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3047.7799999999997s)]
*  We need to indict [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3053.18s)]
*  and I think we need should be a little bit more aggressive [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3054.98s)]
*  on who we indict. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3057.2999999999997s)]
*  There've been a large number of people who were quote unquote [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3060.1s)]
*  just here raising funds for Hezbollah. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3063.18s)]
*  And I think we need to be more aggressive [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3066.46s)]
*  in indicting those types of things. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3068.98s)]
*  We need to be much more aggressive with diplomatic efforts. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3071.7000000000003s)]
*  Iranians are very sensitive to visa bans, right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3075.06s)]
*  You know better than most, right? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3080.82s)]
*  How many kids of senior Iranians or Hezbollah or Hamas. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3082.82s)]
*  Of Islamic Republic officials. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3088.5800000000004s)]
*  Exactly, are studying in the best universities [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3090.1400000000003s)]
*  in this country. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3093.38s)]
*  How many of their mostly wives and daughters, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3094.42s)]
*  probably some sons too, but the cases I know, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3097.1000000000004s)]
*  wives and daughters like to shop in New York [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3099.38s)]
*  and shop in Paris. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3101.78s)]
*  And I don't think putting those types of visa bans [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3102.86s)]
*  in place is a small thing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3108.6600000000003s)]
*  If it's all we did, it would be nothing. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3109.9s)]
*  We should be doing things to make it clear [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3111.3s)]
*  that you can't do this and still live that life [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3112.82s)]
*  that you want. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3115.5s)]
*  And then yes, there is a place for kinetic action here. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3116.62s)]
*  And I think the first place we have to look is at this. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3120.5s)]
*  To me, one of the biggest takeaways post-October 7th [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3126.2599999999998s)]
*  is the fact that if you sit back and you look at the Hezbollahs [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3130.14s)]
*  and the Hamas's and the Houthis, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3133.94s)]
*  probably some other groups that don't start in H [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3136.54s)]
*  around the region, none of them, even Hezbollah [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3138.74s)]
*  would be anywhere near as capable of doing anything close [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3144.06s)]
*  to what they've been doing were it not for Iranian money, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3149.06s)]
*  weapons, training and intelligence. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3153.06s)]
*  That's the secret sauce. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3156.7s)]
*  And our problem is that in over many years [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3158.18s)]
*  where things were relatively quiet in the region, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3160.3799999999997s)]
*  we're like, okay, look, things have never been quieter. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3162.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3165.18s)]
*  We've had national security advisors, right? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3166.02s)]
*  In foreign affairs, look, things have never been quieter. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3167.4599999999996s)]
*  And in fact, what was happening was tremendous amounts [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3169.74s)]
*  of planning for what became, for example, October 7th [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3172.3s)]
*  with huge amounts and not just planning, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3176.5800000000004s)]
*  but funneling weapons into Gaza Strip, into Lebanon, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3178.82s)]
*  into Yemen, in the two years leading up to October 7th, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3184.38s)]
*  Iran stopped insisting that weapons going into the West Bank [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3188.42s)]
*  have to go to Hamas or Islamic Jihad. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3191.46s)]
*  And they just said, you know what, actually, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3193.7000000000003s)]
*  let's just flood the West Bank with weapons. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3194.82s)]
*  Anybody who wants to shoot at Israelis, knock yourself out. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3196.3s)]
*  And so I think this is one of the single most important [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3199.2200000000003s)]
*  things we have to focus on. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3201.9s)]
*  It's gonna take intelligence resources. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3203.14s)]
*  This is not easy. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3205.42s)]
*  Is to disrupt Hezbollah, I'm sorry, Iran's weapons [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3207.3s)]
*  and also money, but let's focus first on weapons, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3212.02s)]
*  smuggling operations. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3216.3s)]
*  Explain to me why Iran should be able to move weapons [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3219.1800000000003s)]
*  to all these different places. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3225.42s)]
*  That means some pretty serious conversations with Oman. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3226.3s)]
*  That means some pretty serious conversations [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3229.54s)]
*  with the Iraqis. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3231.06s)]
*  I mean, some pretty aggressive activities at sea. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3232.34s)]
*  It may mean some kinetic activities at sea. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3235.98s)]
*  But I wanna focus on the kinetic activities, Matt, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3238.06s)]
*  because I think you mentioned early in the podcast [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3239.94s)]
*  and that a number of US officials were high-fiving [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3242.54s)]
*  after the Israelis killed Nasrallah [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3245.66s)]
*  and other senior Hezbollah terrorists [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3248.1s)]
*  who had American blood on their hands, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3251.34s)]
*  who had been living in Lebanon comfortably for decades. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3253.58s)]
*  And it took the Israelis to go after them [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3257.86s)]
*  and take them off of the battlefield. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  Why didn't we? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3263.42s)]
*  I mean, these people had like 20, 30, whatever, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3264.6200000000003s)]
*  million dollars of bounties on their head. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3267.6600000000003s)]
*  They killed and maimed Americans, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3271.6200000000003s)]
*  and yet they were able to live in relative comfort [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3273.42s)]
*  and operate with impunity for years. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3277.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3279.6200000000003s)]
*  Why are we depending on the Israelis [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3280.46s)]
*  to take the killers of Americans off the battlefield? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3282.1s)]
*  Why are we, for example, and I think it's still going on [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3285.7799999999997s)]
*  even in this campaign right now against the Houthis, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3287.9399999999996s)]
*  and it certainly did during the Biden administration [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3290.8999999999996s)]
*  and it has so far during the Trump administration, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3293.2999999999997s)]
*  why are we attacking the Houthis [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3295.9399999999996s)]
*  but allowing the Iranians, the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3298.8999999999996s)]
*  that provides the weapons, the money, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3302.22s)]
*  the intelligence to the Houthis off the hook [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3304.9799999999996s)]
*  so that they can operate with impunity? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3308.3799999999997s)]
*  Why is our approach to all of this, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3310.2599999999998s)]
*  indictments, trials, designations, sanctions, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3313.22s)]
*  red notices, the tools of diplomatic power [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3320.14s)]
*  and economic power we have, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3326.18s)]
*  that I agree with you are important. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3328.02s)]
*  It's not an either or, but why are we not killing [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3329.8999999999996s)]
*  the terrorists, the Hezbollah terrorists [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3335.7s)]
*  and Iranian terrorists the way that we had operated [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3338.18s)]
*  against Al-Qaeda and ISIS and other terrorist organizations? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3342.1s)]
*  Why are we making this distinction? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3345.58s)]
*  So I think, I mean, I could tell you [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3347.7s)]
*  but I have to kill you. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3349.62s)]
*  I'm not afraid of you like that. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3352.14s)]
*  Stop kicking me under the table. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3355.46s)]
*  Look, one reason is that we've always seen, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3357.9s)]
*  officials have always seen ISIS and Al-Qaeda differently [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3361.9s)]
*  because as I said at the beginning, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3364.1s)]
*  the Iranians and the Hezbollah, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3366.18s)]
*  they don't kill you every opportunity they have, right? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3367.66s)]
*  So there's an inherently different threat. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3369.94s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers of plots [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3372.62s)]
*  and the number of, there was a much bigger threat, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3374.5s)]
*  much more immediate threat from the Al-Qaeda, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3376.9s)]
*  the Islamic States, et cetera. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3379.7400000000002s)]
*  We have a hard time, I think, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3381.78s)]
*  wrapping our heads around adversaries [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3383.3s)]
*  that threaten us really badly, but not as consistently. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3386.58s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3390.98s)]
*  the number of dead and wounded aren't as high [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3391.82s)]
*  and aren't as many Americans. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3394.62s)]
*  I hoped in the post October 7th era, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3396.86s)]
*  which by the way is, I think most people forget, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3399.86s)]
*  one of the deadliest attacks for Americans, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3402.78s)]
*  if you list out all the acts of terrorism [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3406.1s)]
*  that we've suffered over the years, I think that's changed. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3409.38s)]
*  I do think that also that both the military [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3413.78s)]
*  and the intelligence community, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3417.58s)]
*  they really see the kinetic as the absolute [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3419.2200000000003s)]
*  last worst option. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3421.86s)]
*  And on the Iran side in particular, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3423.46s)]
*  there has always been across [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3425.1800000000003s)]
*  democratic and Republican administrations, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3428.34s)]
*  a wariness of poking the bear [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3430.86s)]
*  because it's not just terrorism, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3436.1400000000003s)]
*  it's regional malign activity, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3437.6600000000003s)]
*  it's not regional malign activity only, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3438.98s)]
*  it's the nuclear file. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3440.5s)]
*  And there was a sense that if you were too aggressive [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3441.94s)]
*  in one area, you could push them to do something [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3446.54s)]
*  you didn't want them to do in another. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3449.7000000000003s)]
*  And there were instances both where we should, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3451.46s)]
*  I think we should have acted it and didn't, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3454.54s)]
*  and where we did. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3456.42s)]
*  Well, was that in mind? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3457.82s)]
*  Let me just, let me give you an example of each. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3458.86s)]
*  Yeah, please do. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3460.26s)]
*  You know, it took a year or so for it to come out, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3461.5800000000004s)]
*  but it turns out that when Hezbollah's [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3465.1800000000003s)]
*  arch-terrorist Ahmad Mugnio was killed in February 2008, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3468.5s)]
*  that was not only an Israeli operation, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3471.2200000000003s)]
*  that was a joint US-Israeli operation [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3473.06s)]
*  with the US operatives boots on the ground. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3475.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, it's also true that we, apparently the United States [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3478.2200000000003s)]
*  vetoed an opportunity to take him out a few days earlier [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3483.06s)]
*  because senior leader possibly Qasem Soleimani [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3486.38s)]
*  was there too and they didn't want to rock that boat. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3489.86s)]
*  But another example is when we were fighting the war [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3493.6600000000003s)]
*  in Iraq and we had Iranian senior IRGC officials [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3495.7000000000003s)]
*  and of course, his ball officials doing things, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3499.86s)]
*  including targeting Americans. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3501.94s)]
*  And we actually detained the number three Quds Force officer [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3503.26s)]
*  in Iraq and we had him for a little while [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3508.54s)]
*  and then eventually released him. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3511.1800000000003s)]
*  But there was a big debate as to once it became clear [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3512.62s)]
*  that the Iranians were providing EFPs, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3515.54s)]
*  explosive form penetrators, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3518.22s)]
*  to punch through our armored vehicles [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3520.46s)]
*  and the Iranians were engaging in and enabling [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3522.38s)]
*  and pushing others to engage in lethal action [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3525.82s)]
*  against Americans. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3528.22s)]
*  There was a serious talk about what kind of limited [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3529.42s)]
*  military attack could we do in Iran targeting IRGC [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3532.46s)]
*  or Quds Force to send them a message [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3536.5s)]
*  and at the end of the day, the decision was not. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3537.74s)]
*  And I think that the Iranians got that message. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3540.34s)]
*  They got that message and they've continued [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3543.3s)]
*  to escalate against us for years. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3545.98s)]
*  I mean, I think the Israeli lesson for me [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3547.7000000000003s)]
*  from October 7th is you escalate to deescalate, right? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3549.46s)]
*  In terms of your pacing operations, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3557.86s)]
*  your military operations, you do more, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3559.6600000000003s)]
*  you escalate beyond what Hezbollah expects you to do. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3562.78s)]
*  And I don't think Nasrallah expected [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3566.34s)]
*  that the Israeli Air Force- [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3569.0200000000004s)]
*  Nasrallah was thought of by the Iranians [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3569.86s)]
*  as the Israel whisperer, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3571.34s)]
*  the guy who had his finger on the pulse of Israel. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3572.5s)]
*  He absolutely did not anticipate that the Israelis [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3574.78s)]
*  would develop capabilities to overcome [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3578.14s)]
*  what most Israelis and clearly Nasrallah himself [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3581.06s)]
*  saw as a mutually deterrent situation. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3583.94s)]
*  I will say that you ideally don't wanna have [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3587.78s)]
*  to be in a situation where you have to escalate [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3589.74s)]
*  to deescalate, you wanna be dealing with this [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3592.38s)]
*  at pace on a regular basis over time. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3595.46s)]
*  And then maybe you don't have to do that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3599.7s)]
*  The problem is if you get to a point where, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3602.06s)]
*  oh my God, it turns out Hamas has held onto Gaza [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3604.34s)]
*  for all these years since 2007, by the way, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3607.62s)]
*  when they turned their weapons on fellow Palestinians [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3611.1s)]
*  because the Israelis had already withdrawn in 2005. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3613.38s)]
*  And it turns out of all these years, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3617.02s)]
*  they dug all these tunnels, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3619.2999999999997s)]
*  many more kilometers of tunnels [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3621.38s)]
*  than the Israelis anticipated, had all these weapons, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3623.1s)]
*  figured out ways to breach the incredibly sophisticated [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3626.06s)]
*  Israeli security fence, which was above ground, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3629.54s)]
*  which was above ground. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3631.74s)]
*  If you let your adversaries who are committed [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3633.4199999999996s)]
*  to your destruction sit cozy over a long period of time, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3635.8599999999997s)]
*  the expectation that they will moderate [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3640.54s)]
*  and be co-opted by the need to pay teacher salaries is wrong. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3644.22s)]
*  Now, there are indications that most Gazans, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3649.1s)]
*  as I said, we took this poll, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3651.4199999999996s)]
*  most Gazans actually were moving away, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3652.74s)]
*  weren't from the Hamas idea of attack Israel's costs. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3656.1s)]
*  But for the hardcore Hamas guys, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3660.42s)]
*  that only propelled them to say, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3661.86s)]
*  we've got to do something so big [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3663.1s)]
*  to completely change the dynamic. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3665.02s)]
*  People are losing their commitment to their resistance. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3667.02s)]
*  And so it pains me to say it, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3670.3s)]
*  but the extremely effective intelligence coup [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3672.5s)]
*  that Hamas pulled over the Israelis and the rest of us, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3675.26s)]
*  leading the Israelis to believe that Hamas [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3679.5s)]
*  prioritized their governance project in Gaza [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3681.86s)]
*  over attacking Israel, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3684.2200000000003s)]
*  and that there was an element of deterrence there, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3685.9s)]
*  they were absolutely wrong. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3688.02s)]
*  And I think the lesson has to be, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3690.58s)]
*  you can't simply say, well, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3693.7000000000003s)]
*  they're not attacking me today. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3695.26s)]
*  It's been calm, but they've got a billion [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3696.94s)]
*  and a half rockets pointed at my face, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3699.1400000000003s)]
*  but that's okay, because maybe I can deter them, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3701.1400000000003s)]
*  because maybe they don't really mean it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3704.98s)]
*  If there's someone who's committed to your destruction [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3707.34s)]
*  and is spending lots of money and collecting lots of arms [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3710.06s)]
*  to do things that can only be used to hurt you, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3714.38s)]
*  you got to do something about it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3718.1800000000003s)]
*  Before the October 7th year. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3720.42s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Matt. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3723.02s)]
*  And that's the lesson, not just for Israelis, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3724.42s)]
*  it's for Americans. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3726.82s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis seem to have moved beyond [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3727.7400000000002s)]
*  that October 6th mindset that you've really described [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3730.02s)]
*  very well with respect to the sort of mutual deterrence [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3733.1800000000003s)]
*  that they had both with Hamas and Hezbollah, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3735.78s)]
*  this desire not to escalate, not to provoke, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3738.46s)]
*  but in not doing so, allowing Hezbollah and Hamas [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3742.98s)]
*  to build up these potent military capabilities [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3745.9s)]
*  that were unleashed on October the 7th. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3750.14s)]
*  The question for the United States is, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3753.5s)]
*  are we October 6th or are we October 8th? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3755.46s)]
*  Are we acknowledging now that our enemies, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3758.8599999999997s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah, have taken their time, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3761.7s)]
*  have built up these very deadly capabilities [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3765.2999999999997s)]
*  of men and weapons, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3769.8599999999997s)]
*  and that they're just waiting to unleash it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3772.7s)]
*  And there's a lot of focus on Iran's nuclear program, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3774.8999999999996s)]
*  because that is the most, I think, deadly threat, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3777.58s)]
*  not just to Israel and our allies in the region, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3780.14s)]
*  but to the United States, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3782.22s)]
*  because Iran is building intercontinental ballistic missiles [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3783.06s)]
*  that will be nuclear tipped with only one address. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3787.38s)]
*  That's not for Israel, that's for the United States [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3789.46s)]
*  and America, are we gonna allow the Islamic Republic [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3791.1s)]
*  to get nuclear tipped ICBMs [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3793.58s)]
*  that could threaten the United States, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3796.22s)]
*  or are we gonna move preemptively to stop that? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3797.94s)]
*  I think that's gonna be the question in 2025. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3800.06s)]
*  But the question that you've, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3803.2599999999998s)]
*  the picture that you've painted, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3804.66s)]
*  which I think is something that gets too little attention [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3806.38s)]
*  and grateful for your work on this, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3809.42s)]
*  is that when you look at the Islamic Republic of Iran [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3813.86s)]
*  and you look at Hezbollah, they have a global network. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3816.1400000000003s)]
*  They have these cells, these relationships [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3818.9s)]
*  with narco-terrorists and with biker gangs [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3823.38s)]
*  and with people that they're using [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3829.38s)]
*  for plausible deniability, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3831.2200000000003s)]
*  but that they're there and that they're waiting, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3833.1400000000003s)]
*  and that they can be operationalized at some point. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3835.74s)]
*  The question is, are we gonna wait until that deadly attack, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3838.14s)]
*  or are you gonna move against them aggressively [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3841.58s)]
*  beyond just sanctions and indictments [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3843.9799999999996s)]
*  and interpol red notices? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3846.74s)]
*  Yeah, and it's an especially acute question, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3849.62s)]
*  given that the mood in Washington right now is, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3852.4599999999996s)]
*  not terms I particularly like, but the terms people use, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3856.2599999999998s)]
*  against forever wars, against endless wars, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3858.8999999999996s)]
*  getting out of the Middle East battlefield, not into it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3862.62s)]
*  And between those two, I would consider fake polls [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3866.66s)]
*  of doing nothing and doing everything, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3871.66s)]
*  there's the addressing the real threat and being present. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3873.7799999999997s)]
*  And so I'm concerned that over multiple administrations, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3877.2599999999998s)]
*  Democratic and Republican, both, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3880.46s)]
*  we have stepped back from the Middle East. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3883.2599999999998s)]
*  We have articulated by default messages to our allies [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3885.5s)]
*  that we are not committed. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3889.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's forced them from their perspective [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3892.7799999999997s)]
*  to diversify their security relationships. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3895.3399999999997s)]
*  There have been good things that have happened, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3899.14s)]
*  for example, the Abraham Accords, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3900.7799999999997s)]
*  there have been positive unintended consequences [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3902.7799999999997s)]
*  of our adversaries actions. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3907.3399999999997s)]
*  I think that the Iranian missile drone strikes on Israel [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3908.54s)]
*  last April and then October had the unintended effect [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3913.74s)]
*  of being the single most effective commercial [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3918.38s)]
*  for the fact that Iran is the biggest threat [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3921.1s)]
*  to the region, not Israel, and that there is a need [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3922.94s)]
*  for a regional air defense and that it works [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3926.38s)]
*  and people want in on this. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3932.9s)]
*  That's good, but I think we, the United States, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3935.5s)]
*  need to be able to articulate what our commitment [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3938.46s)]
*  to the region is and why people can and should rely on us [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3943.22s)]
*  for more than four years or less than four years at a time. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3951.8199999999997s)]
*  And again, that's across multiple administrations [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3956.2599999999998s)]
*  of different political persuasions. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3959.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think this is something [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3962.42s)]
*  that's been consistent. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3963.58s)]
*  Matt, I think those are great takeaways. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3964.7s)]
*  I would add just one final takeaway, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3966.66s)]
*  which is a consistent theme of the Iran breakdown. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3968.14s)]
*  And that is that millions of Iranians inside Iran [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3970.98s)]
*  despise the Islamic Republic, despise Ali Khamenei [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3973.7799999999997s)]
*  and the IRGC and the Ministry of Intelligence [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3977.94s)]
*  because they know them up close. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3980.06s)]
*  You've mentioned it throughout this podcast. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3982.2999999999997s)]
*  They've been brutalized by them. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3984.02s)]
*  And it's been a failure from the United States [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3985.98s)]
*  across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3989.9s)]
*  to provide support, maximum support to the Iranian people [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3992.74s)]
*  who want to see the end of the Islamic Republic [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3996.58s)]
*  in a secular Iranian democracy. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3998.22s)]
*  So consistent theme will be through this podcast. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=3999.74s)]
*  I hope that this administration understands [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4002.42s)]
*  that if you want to peacefully undermine [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4005.34s)]
*  and weaken this regime, support the Iranian people [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4007.46s)]
*  who are prepared to go to the streets to do it. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4010.46s)]
*  So go back just to that case we talked about earlier [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4012.94s)]
*  that's been going on in New York right now, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4016.14s)]
*  the people who tried to kill Masa Ali Najat, right? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4018.1s)]
*  Why are they so petrified of a petite, lovely woman, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4021.94s)]
*  but a petite woman with frizzy hair [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4026.5s)]
*  and typically a flower in her hair. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4027.94s)]
*  She's not carrying a gun. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4029.7000000000003s)]
*  She's not, you know, she doesn't lead a militia. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4031.2200000000003s)]
*  What they're petrified of is that she empowers women [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4034.34s)]
*  and men in Iran to stand up against forced hijab [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4038.1000000000004s)]
*  and to send videos so people can document [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4043.2200000000003s)]
*  what's actually happening there, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4047.0600000000004s)]
*  that there is significant protest against the regime. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4048.34s)]
*  This theocratic totalitarian regime is so afraid [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4053.82s)]
*  that forced hijab is some type of magic Jenga block. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4058.6600000000003s)]
*  And that if people like Masa Ali Najat, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4062.22s)]
*  just by leveraging the free speech [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4065.4199999999996s)]
*  that they don't have there, but she has here [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4067.58s)]
*  and giving people the confidence [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4070.1s)]
*  to post that type of material, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4074.7s)]
*  that if that Jenga block is pulled out, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4077.74s)]
*  the whole regime will begin to fall apart. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4080.06s)]
*  So I don't think officials in the West [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4082.3399999999997s)]
*  are fully cognizant of that, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4085.58s)]
*  but it's very clear that the Iranians are. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4087.94s)]
*  Matt, you know, I hate to give you compliments. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4090.58s)]
*  It's really painful, but that was really beautifully put. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4094.18s)]
*  And that is exactly right. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4097.3s)]
*  Did you hear mom? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4098.14s)]
*  Did you hear that? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4098.98s)]
*  Beautifully put. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4100.54s)]
*  Now, thank you. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4101.46s)]
*  And a great note to end on. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4102.3s)]
*  Matt, thank you so much for joining us. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4103.14s)]
*  And we'd love to have you back to talk about [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4104.62s)]
*  all the other great work that you're doing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4106.94s)]
*  We're gonna have to get back together [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4108.46s)]
*  because there was way too much agreement here. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4110.14s)]
*  And one of my favorite things to do is to demonstrate [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4112.74s)]
*  how to disagree without being disagreeable [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4115.46s)]
*  with Mark Dubowitz. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4118.06s)]
*  In fact, that might be the title of my next podcast. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4119.78s)]
*  Disagreeable with Mark Dubowitz. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4123.38s)]
*  Thanks, Matt, we appreciate it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4126.139999999999s)]
*  Pleasure to be here. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4127.62s)]
*  That's it for this episode of the Iran Breakdown. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4130.139999999999s)]
*  Iran's global terror network isn't just a collection [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4132.54s)]
*  of rogue terrorist organizations. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4135.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a carefully orchestrated strategy [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4137.099999999999s)]
*  designed to undermine US interests, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4139.139999999999s)]
*  threaten Israel, and destabilize the world. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4141.179999999999s)]
*  Iran continues to wage war through Hezbollah, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4144.0599999999995s)]
*  through other proxies, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4146.62s)]
*  evading consequences while fueling conflict [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4148.1s)]
*  from the Middle East, Africa, Latin American, and beyond. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4150.38s)]
*  Big thanks to Dr. Matt Levitt for his expert insights [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4154.26s)]
*  on how Hezbollah operates [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4156.860000000001s)]
*  and how Iran operates terror proxies around the world. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4158.820000000001s)]
*  Talked about how they're funded [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4162.14s)]
*  and what must be done to stop it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4163.3s)]
*  We're gonna continue tracking Iran's terror network [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4165.1s)]
*  and breaking down what policymakers need to know. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4167.46s)]
*  I'm Mark Dubowitz, and this has been the Iran Breakdown. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4170.1s)]
*  Thanks so much for tuning in. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W37JRb29c7s&t=4172.860000000001s)]
