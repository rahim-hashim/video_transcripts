Video Description: Liraz Charhi is an Israeli artist with deep Iranian roots, and her voice is shaking the walls of the Islamic Republic. 
Known for her role on the hit Apple TV+ series Tehran, Liraz joins Mark Dubowitz to reveal how her art became real-life defiance: from secretly collaborating with Iranian women banned from singing, to recording underground albums across encrypted apps, and turning her song "Roya" — a song you're familiar with, as it's the theme music to this podcast series — into an anthem for the Woman, Life, Freedom movement. This is a story of identity, rebellion, and the dream of a free Iran — sung loud enough to rattle the regime and inspire a generation.

# THE IRAN BREAKDOWN | Rage Against the Regime: Music as Rebellion (featuring Liraz Charhi)
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE)
*  It was like, okay, we're doing it. We felt like a miracle is happening. The after effect is that they're on their way to Iran and the airport until the minute that they said, okay, I'm home, I say I had panic attacks. I didn't know what to do with my son. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Iran breakdown, the podcast where we expose the cracks in the Islamic Republic and amplify some of the voices working to bring it down. Today's guest is the last chart. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=17.64s)]
*  Israeli actress and singer with deep Iranian roots and one of the most defined cultural voices pushing back against the regime. Born in Israel to Persian Jewish parents who escaped Omanis Islamist revolution. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=27.92s)]
*  It has grew up with one foot in freedom and the other haunted by the country her family left behind her music performed in Persian and Hebrew isn't just art. It's defiant. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=39.68s)]
*  He rises secretly collaborated with Iranian female musicians inside Iran. Women banned from singing solo in public. They record their voices in whispers, lock behind doors and sent to her through encrypted app. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=50.199999999999996s)]
*  She's also brought some of these female musicians to Europe where they've performed together, hiding their faces to protect their identities and their loved ones. Every note is an act of rebellion. Every track is a risk. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=62.72s)]
*  The sound feels familiar. That is because it is theme song of the Iran breakdown podcast comes from her Persian language song Roya, a haunting anthem that means dream. It's like a call to wake up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=75.24s)]
*  In this episode, we dive into how these Iranian Israeli collaborations began, what it means to make music under tyranny. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  While he rise refuses to be silent. This isn't a story just about art. It's a story about defiance against the mullahs who rule Iran. This is the Iran breakdown. I'm your host, Mark Dubowitz. So let's break it down. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=94.92s)]
*  There is welcome to the podcast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=107.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Mark. I'm so excited to meet you here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=109.56s)]
*  So wonderful to see you again. And we're doing this podcast from Tel Aviv. I know you live you live in Jaffa. Yeah, just down the street. Yeah. And Liraz, I want to start with your story. It's an amazing story about your family, about your deep Persian roots, and obviously, your your connection growing up in Israel to your country that your parents fled. Tell us a little bit about their story and your story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=112.96s)]
*  So I was born to both parents who immigrated from Iran to Israel back in the 60s and 70s before the revolution, because they felt that revolution is starting to happen. You know, they were used to live in Jewish neighborhoods. They needed to hide their, you know, their religious. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=138.52s)]
*  My mom, she moved from one school to the other because she needed to read from the Quran every day. And it was very challenging to hide the fact that she is Jewish. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  A lot of antisemitism back at the time that started to really, really grow. And of course, they're Zionist. So they had the courage, both of my family sides to move to Israel. My parents, they met here in Israel. And while they were like new, new people here, like Olim Chadechim, they got married and brought me and my brothers in Ramle, which is a province, let's say, here in Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=176.56s)]
*  So I grew up, I can say, definitely with both identities. I grew up in a very, very Iranian, strict home and felt the major difference of the Israeli outside doors life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=206.56s)]
*  Meaning that I'm always saying when I'm having concerts that the metaphor and how do I reflect it is that I was walking on the crossroad from home to school. And at the same time I was going out from home to school, I switched my identities. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=231.52s)]
*  Inside I was very, you know, the obeying good Iranian girl saying yes to everything and respecting my parents, of course. And I can you can just imagine from the religious to food to the way that they grew me up. I was very, very, very Iranian. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=249.96s)]
*  And outside when I switched this person, I was the out loud artists who really wants to be on stage to sing, to play, to dance. And I got really, really confused because they carried for many years both characters. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=270.28s)]
*  I was like a little girl, like an agent, you know, like I was I was really confused. And when I was a teenager, you know, I started to ask a lot of question about my heritage. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=287.72s)]
*  And my parents always told me beautiful stories about Iran, the people, the culture, the views, the food, everything sounded very, very, you know, beautiful and powerful. And I really reached all my life to visit in Iran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=300.36s)]
*  Where were they from in Iran? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=322.2s)]
*  They're from Tehran, both of them. But they have backgrounds from Isfahan and Khumsar, which is a village in. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=323.64s)]
*  And how many how many generations does your family go back in in Iran? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  I cannot say, but. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean, multiple generations stretching back maybe decades, if not hundreds of years. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=336.76s)]
*  Yes, they they don't have family that that connected to Israel until they moved to Israel. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  It's a 64. My dad arrived and my mom at 1990 70. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  So you grew up as a as an Iranian Israeli and an Israeli Iranian with both identities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=354.52s)]
*  Complex situation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=361.8s)]
*  And I was like, I had a lot of rage because every time I wanted to explore my my my roots and my heritage, I, you know, I opened the television and the radio and what I saw is Ahmadinejad and. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=363.32s)]
*  Different different different stories about Iran, you know, like it's the opposite. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=375.08s)]
*  The thing that really broke my heart is the oppressed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=380.92s)]
*  Oppressed people, especially the oppressed women. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=385.96s)]
*  I cannot say why since I was a teenager, but I understood it afterwards when I started to sing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=389.64s)]
*  Well, let's talk a little bit about your your career. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=396.92s)]
*  I mean, it's funny you mentioned this sort of sense that you were an agent, which reminds me that you you know, you started in the Apple series, Tehran. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=398.76s)]
*  Where you played a you played right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=407.4s)]
*  You played a Mossad agent. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=410.6s)]
*  Now, spoiler alert for anyone who has not watched that wonderful series. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=413.32s)]
*  But it's interesting because in the in the show at the end of season one, it is revealed that you are not a Mossad agent, but you're actually a double agent working on behalf of the Islamic Republic. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=418.84s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about the show? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=431.48s)]
*  The story that I really I got identified with the character because. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=433.4s)]
*  It's. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=440.35999999999996s)]
*  It was very natural for me to understand that she has both both characters and that's the way I grew up and always ask myself, who am I? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=442.2s)]
*  Am I Iranian? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=451.96s)]
*  Am I Israeli? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=452.84s)]
*  I mean, at some point I must say, and also when I worked on the part with the. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  With the team and the director, Danny Silkin, which is amazing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=460.04s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=465.08s)]
*  At some point you need to make a choice. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=471.72s)]
*  And this is what I did. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  I was like neglecting my Iranian roots. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=474.12s)]
*  I said, OK, I'm not Iranian. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=477.88s)]
*  I'm Israeli. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=478.92s)]
*  I was born here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=479.64s)]
*  My parents have the story Iran changed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=480.68s)]
*  I mean, I cannot do anything about that, and it bothers me. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=483.24s)]
*  So I've decided to be Israeli period when my parents spoke to me in Farsi. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=487.56s)]
*  I always answered in Hebrew when they spoke to me Farsi in front of, you know, neighbors and friends. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  I said, Mom, if we did it, he brought don't speak to me in Farsi. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=499.0s)]
*  Same as Yale. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  Has this conflict. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  But when I read the script, I was telling Danny Silkin, the director. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, most of the time she's talking about. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  Most of the time she's speaking over the phone and she gives permission or not to do this and that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=516.68s)]
*  And he said, please read it until the end. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=524.28s)]
*  At the end, Yale revealing her. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=527.0799999999999s)]
*  Her, you know, the fact that she chose. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=531.56s)]
*  Iran, which was a big thing for me because while the TV series was on, the Israeli were saying, oh, you did an amazing job. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=535.2399999999999s)]
*  Great role. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=546.6s)]
*  And it was covered. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  Everyone was home and just watched. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=549.16s)]
*  You're playing this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=551.16s)]
*  You're playing this Mossad handler. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=553.8000000000001s)]
*  So you're handling the main agent who's is a Mossad agent. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=554.12s)]
*  Tamara Binian. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=558.12s)]
*  Tamara, who is in Iran and you're the main handler talking to her, giving her instructions. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=559.0s)]
*  A lot of instructions over the phone. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=565.08s)]
*  And I would say, oh, my God, this role is not going anywhere. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=567.0s)]
*  I mean, I can be I can do it, but I need the sassiness of this role. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=569.88s)]
*  And then he said, please read it until the end. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  At the end, Yale is taken aside. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=576.92s)]
*  You know, she's she's she's she's choosing Iran. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=579.48s)]
*  And that was the the the the point that I understood that I'm getting like haters from Iran saying, oh, you chose Israel and we Iranian love you love your music here in Iran. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=583.64s)]
*  I was it was it was my second Iranian album that was out at this time, and it was really, really well known in Iran. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=598.12s)]
*  It was like, oh, we love your music. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=604.76s)]
*  But but why are you taking Israel's side? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=606.8399999999999s)]
*  Why did you took this role? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  And then the haters until when we get to the to the last chapter of the series, the haters came from Israel saying, why did you choose the Iranian side? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  And the Iranian was saying, oh, my God, thank you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=624.12s)]
*  I mean, there was so amazing, like reflection of this this double identity and exactly and this challenge that you had exactly between these two identities. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=627.4s)]
*  And then it's it's just a role. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not it's not the real life in real life. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=637.0s)]
*  I'm pro piece. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  I love both sides. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=640.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=642.6s)]
*  So that was a funny part to play while I am like also hiding my art with the Iranian musicians when I was. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=642.92s)]
*  I want to talk to you about that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=654.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=655.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=655.64s)]
*  I mean, so people know you from this Apple series, Tehran, by the way, for folks listening who haven't watched it, it really is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=655.88s)]
*  It's a remarkable series. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=661.72s)]
*  We just had a spoiler. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=663.24s)]
*  So how will they watch it? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=664.2s)]
*  I know we try to we try to give it a little bit of nuance so they don't know quite what happened in the end. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=665.64s)]
*  But it's it's a remarkable series. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=671.32s)]
*  I know it's season three is out in Israel in Israel and it'll be out soon in the United States and around the world. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=673.48s)]
*  Actors, actresses, a production of two great ladies who took chance during the covid to shoot it in Greece. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=680.6s)]
*  Actually, there was streets in Greece that me and the Iranian actors from aboard thought they're really, really walking in Iran. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=691.8800000000001s)]
*  We thought they are like Iranian restaurants and we didn't realize that it's production art. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  It was it looked so beautiful. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a remarkably produced series and really gripping and exciting. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=709.48s)]
*  And it reminded me of the very famous also Israeli series, Fowda. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=713.96s)]
*  And I think there's some. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=718.52s)]
*  You know, we Israeli, we know how to make art. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=719.88s)]
*  No, it's great art. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=722.04s)]
*  So let's talk about your art because you're also you're known for for your music and also singing in in both Hebrew and in in Farsi. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=722.84s)]
*  Tell us about your a little bit about your music career and particularly your decision to to sing in. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=732.6s)]
*  Farsi. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=737.96s)]
*  In Farsi, which is really unusual and interesting. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=738.92s)]
*  And I guess it's also you're connected in some way to one of Israel's most well known singers who also sings in Farsi and really help revive this connection to to Persian culture in Israel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=742.12s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=757.0799999999999s)]
*  Want to talk about about that? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=758.52s)]
*  I'll talk about anything. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  I grew up in a very, very musical family. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=761.0s)]
*  I you know, I had this mainstream career of doing films, acting in theater, also in TV series. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=763.8s)]
*  It was it was going very well. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=775.08s)]
*  And then I went to had a PR tour in Los Angeles with an Israeli movie. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=777.56s)]
*  Actually, it was my first movie called Turn Left at the End of the World. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=783.4s)]
*  It's a Vinashra's movie and I revealed that I just found out that I have a lot of family in Los Angeles and I felt that the truth about people saying that Los Angeles is actually Teher Angeles. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=787.72s)]
*  So I was digging in inside, you know, the Iranian neighborhoods trying to catch everything I can. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=807.64s)]
*  That was the point that I realized I cannot neglect my roots. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=814.6s)]
*  I mean, it is haunting me and finally in a good way because I can actually walk inside Iranian neighborhoods and meet family and people speak to me in Farsi. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=819.0s)]
*  And I had two albums in Hebrew, which were OK, but I didn't find my way to to the Israeli music. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=831.96s)]
*  Also, of course, I came from a beautiful family, which my aunt Rita is is it's not just me that saying she's the best phenomenal singer in Israel and she's a great woman. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=839.96s)]
*  So I got a lot of inspiration from her. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=854.52s)]
*  And she sings also in both Hebrew and Farsi. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=857.64s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=860.32s)]
*  She had an album in Farsi. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=861.48s)]
*  I mean, Rita, she was born in Iran and she moved to Israel when she was, I think, eight or nine. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=863.32s)]
*  And and yes, she broke every wall like every woman in my family, you know, for for freedom in a way, which was really, really exciting watching each one of them, you know, going going through life and breaking walls. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  So I can say to her, Angela's was the first wall I broke inside myself. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=889.8s)]
*  You know, I was letting myself go to the Iranian vibes, family, food, art. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=895.5999999999999s)]
*  I went to literature shops reading suddenly Hafez and Rumi. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=902.8s)]
*  And especially I digged in into Iranian psychedelic seventies music, which really, really filled my heart with. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=908.4s)]
*  Hope, because when I've heard the Iranian, especially Iranian women's voices, I felt they have some thick layer of courage inside their voices, which I am not familiar from my family. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=918.8s)]
*  Before and after the revolution, it's important to say Iranian women and men has something inside their veins. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=934.76s)]
*  Who's a little bit strict and very oppressed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=944.32s)]
*  It's not about the extreme regime who said, OK, you are you must go with hijab. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=950.24s)]
*  You must be religious, et cetera. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=956.0400000000001s)]
*  It's something inside our veins that doesn't allow us to express ourselves freely. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=958.64s)]
*  It's something that goes back, back, back, you know, at our I don't know if genetic, if it's it's energetic, but I can feel it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=968.16s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a very, like, let's say liberal home. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=978.12s)]
*  But I knew without talking about what are my my my rules and my boundaries inside home. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=981.96s)]
*  Supposed to when I supposed to get married, who am I supposed to to be married to, et cetera. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=991.0s)]
*  I mean, nothing that was talking about it, but it was inside our veins, you know. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  I know I'm not allowing, even though I live in Israel, to have a boyfriend at some age and et cetera. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1002.2800000000001s)]
*  So. In Tehran, I felt like the music and the psychedelic music is giving me a different [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1009.52s)]
*  angle about Iran and Iranian women, because what I know is the music from 50s, 60s, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1020.44s)]
*  they sang very polite and everything was also very, like very traditional, traditional. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1027.76s)]
*  Thank you. And and then, you know, I understand that musicians going going to to Europe to have music, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1033.32s)]
*  music lessons and got back to to Iran and they they wrote and sang and the vibes were very, very much more multicultural, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1046.24s)]
*  which which was the first hint for me to understand that I don't need to hide my my my Iranian roots, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1057.44s)]
*  my Israeli behavior, because I have so many layers that can go and and and and shine out via my my art. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  Then I understood that I'm looking for my goal when I got so much Iranian vibes, I said, OK, you got it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  You love it. Now you have to to know what you're doing in life. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1085.04s)]
*  I was four years, you know, back and forth to Tel Aviv and Los Angeles. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1088.8s)]
*  I had auditions. I played in Hollywood movies. It was really nice. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1095.0s)]
*  But at some point it was a bit boring for me to go from room to room and to say, hi, I'm Liraz. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1098.72s)]
*  I'm an actress. La la la la. I really wanted to sing. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1106.0s)]
*  I wanted to sing and I wanted to bring a message. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1109.4s)]
*  And for sure, my message was about the oppressed women in Iran because my love to the women of my family. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1112.4s)]
*  I grew up to, you know, both grandmothers who got engaged at age 11 and got married when they were 13 and 15. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1122.3200000000002s)]
*  They were little girls. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  And what's the main thing that gave me strength in life is my grandmother's and my mother and her sister's sisters, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1135.24s)]
*  because they had so many challenging. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1146.32s)]
*  Life life situations, but they not say situation, they had challenging life, you know, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1151.48s)]
*  and they were always they always choose to be happy. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1158.96s)]
*  Not being a victim of the circumstances, just be happy having eight kids, four kids going from Iran to Israel. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1165.76s)]
*  My grandmother, my mom's mom, she she's a singer, but she was not able to sing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1177.56s)]
*  And this fact literally crushed my heart because my grandfather promised her that she can sing in Israel. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1184.88s)]
*  And when they moved here, he did not allow her to sing. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1192.88s)]
*  She was singing in bar mitzvah and weddings, and he was always like gesturing her the way back from the stage to sit. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think this fact and the cultural oppressed vibes we have in our veins and the fact that until today, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1205.44s)]
*  since revolution, Iranian women are not able to do this one pure, simple thing. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1217.96s)]
*  And that is to sing, which is crazy. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  All of this and the 70s psychedelic music of the sassiness, thickness, you know, layers on women's voices like Gugush and Ramesh, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1227.8s)]
*  which I admire, that, by the way, stopped singing for 20 years and kept singing after they left Iran. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1237.52s)]
*  So many stories and and and and I understood in Los Angeles that I need to sing for this this ladies because I'm free to sing. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1247.8s)]
*  I mean, for now, I'm still free to sing in Israel. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1258.72s)]
*  You're laughing. I'm laughing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1262.96s)]
*  I think you'll be OK. I know what you're suggesting, but I think you're going to be OK. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1264.28s)]
*  What I'm interested to hear now is so you discover this, you know, that within yourself, the power of your voice, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1268.68s)]
*  the power of your Iranian identity and the sort of recognition that as a free Israeli [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  who is able to sing here in the 2020s without people constraining you, without people oppressing you, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1283.6399999999999s)]
*  you have all of these Iranian women who are living in the Islamic Republic who don't have that freedom. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1293.84s)]
*  Yeah. And also don't have that voice. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1298.32s)]
*  They don't have that voice. And also, I've been following for the last almost 20 years. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1300.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, before it was the social media, Instagram, Telegram, et cetera. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  I've been following on women's little revolutions in Iran, taking off the veil, taking off the hijab, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1312.48s)]
*  dancing and singing in front of train stations, buses, police stations. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1320.92s)]
*  They've been so powerful. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1327.68s)]
*  And I was very curious about what the process is going to be until they get their freedom back. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1330.88s)]
*  I mean, I was actually digging every Internet website to read about them, the articles about them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1339.24s)]
*  Very, very small groups of powerful, courageous women who started the hijab revolution. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1346.64s)]
*  So all these stories came to my heart. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1353.76s)]
*  And I understood that I can be the pipe of telling the story of these ladies with my grandmother's stories. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1360.28s)]
*  And with my story, I know, you know, my dad loves me very, very, very much, but he he was preferring I would not sing. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1368.8s)]
*  There is a thing in the Iranian, I don't know how to call it, but I can say it like that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1377.52s)]
*  It's a fact. Artist is equal to be a prostitute. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1387.32s)]
*  It's not for men as well, by the way, not only for women. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1394.72s)]
*  It's not appropriate to be an artist until today in Iran. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  My my friends are are not able to to be artists, even if they leave Iran and very successful aboard. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1401.4399999999998s)]
*  The families in Iran are not accepting the fact that they are artists. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1410.9199999999998s)]
*  You want your sons and daughters to be doctors and engineers and entrepreneurs and scientists. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1414.32s)]
*  But there is that that sort of stereotype that to choose art, to choose music, to choose film. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1420.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's too risky. Can't make a living. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1429.4s)]
*  Maybe it's not just not appropriate for a nice Iranian girl or a nice Iranian boy. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's even more than appropriate or having money or it's something cheap. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1436.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's weird, huh? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1447.3600000000001s)]
*  It's such a beautiful thing to sing and to be on stage or to be a painter or whatever. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  And, you know, and it feels like I'm not saying all of them, but they're very strict about it. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1456.4s)]
*  Most of the families and people. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1464.44s)]
*  And I mean, you're in defiance in the sense of a of a traditional culture. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And a and a history of of constraints and limitations. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And to go out and sing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1476.92s)]
*  I mean, to go out and show your hair, to go out and sing, to go out and paint and to act. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1479.32s)]
*  That's that's an act of defiance. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1485.8s)]
*  And I want to talk a little bit about that, because obviously it's an act of defiance, maybe within the family. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1487.24s)]
*  But certainly for these Iranian women inside the Islamic Republic, it is a major act of defiance because they're really risking their lives. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1491.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about the secret collaboration that you formed with with Iranian women. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1498.12s)]
*  How did you first connect with them? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1503.76s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about even just the logistics of cutting an album and getting them on tour. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1506.04s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what you went through and the opportunity you gave to these Iranian women. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1513.2s)]
*  Actually, the first album I recorded, I got back to Israel from Tehran, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1518.96s)]
*  with the very, very important decision of my life, I'm going to sing in Farsi for for these ladies. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1523.12s)]
*  I'm I'm going to send them my music. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1531.0s)]
*  And it was also for me because I wanted to break the first wall in my life, like I'm going to sing in Farsi. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1535.36s)]
*  You know, I you can imagine that I brought it this idea to to my team and they were saying, oh, you got crazy. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1541.04s)]
*  No one will listen to you when you sing in Farsi. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  You are going to miss all your fans. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1552.08s)]
*  That's a big mistake. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1554.0s)]
*  It took me, Mark, it took me almost 10 years to make it happen. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1555.76s)]
*  Actually, I got the courage until sorry, I got the courage when I gave birth to my first daughter, June. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1561.84s)]
*  So I released the first album. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1571.1999999999998s)]
*  It was a covers for for the Iranian brave women in Iran who who sang at the 70s and got muted. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1574.32s)]
*  And it was like electronic vibes, beats, versions of the songs. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1585.64s)]
*  And I send it to the world with a with a my label. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1591.68s)]
*  And then I don't know how, but very, very quick it got famous in Iran. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1597.44s)]
*  There is a DJ who lives in Iran and in Berlin, in Tehran and Berlin. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1606.5200000000002s)]
*  And she she kind of brought my music. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1614.6s)]
*  And I think this is the reason that I found that women in Iran are listening to my music in a very underground parties, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1616.48s)]
*  taking off the hijab and wearing their Versace Dolce Gabbani and Armani suits underneath the hijab. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  I also got videos of this and I was like shocked. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1637.2s)]
*  Do you think these women knew that you were you're Israeli? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1641.8s)]
*  Definitely. I'll tell you why, because I don't have I don't sound like Iranian singer. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1644.36s)]
*  When I recorded my first album, my mom was saying with her thick accent, Lira's people will not understand. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you have such a weird accent. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1659.7199999999998s)]
*  You don't sound like Iranian singers. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1662.08s)]
*  And mom, I don't want to sound like Iranian singer. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1664.36s)]
*  I mean, you have a distinct identity as a Iranian Israeli. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1668.4399999999998s)]
*  These are my layers and this is my story and I don't want to fake it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1672.04s)]
*  And this album is for my soul and for my sisters. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1677.08s)]
*  And I think this accent really catch them. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1681.28s)]
*  That's the thing that catch them. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1683.96s)]
*  There was a home. Who is this weird girl from Israel who sings in Farsi while she can sing in Hebrew? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1685.32s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1692.84s)]
*  And the covers that I did was really different than the traditional Iranian music. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1694.4s)]
*  So it took them to the dance floor. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1700.88s)]
*  Then they started to follow me. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  I follow them. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1706.8000000000002s)]
*  We became sisters cooking together, watching each other's stories. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1708.2s)]
*  And and and especially I got really, really friend with Iranian musicians, women. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1712.7600000000002s)]
*  And suddenly, oh, she takes her tar and she sings to me and I take her to my recording studio and I show it to my producer. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1722.72s)]
*  And I was like, man, we have it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1735.0s)]
*  Let's let's have a record with them. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1737.92s)]
*  So I'm telling you, it's very like it's a light and like very funny, you know, story. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1740.76s)]
*  But it took time to convince them. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1747.92s)]
*  Some of them started to create it, the album with me and disappeared. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1751.68s)]
*  And then they got back with another profile because they were really afraid. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1755.48s)]
*  But I can tell you that the women and the men that accepted this idea to collaborate were very, very brave, even though they they don't have their names on the album like anonymous names. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1759.8400000000001s)]
*  They made a choice to record this album, to build the bridge of, you know, of trying to understand and to bring peace to the world. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1776.0s)]
*  We actually bringing this bridge to people to make them understand that Iran loves Israel and Israel loves Iran and politics are above us and we don't care. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1788.08s)]
*  So this album was recorded online. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1801.92s)]
*  Was this was this Zan Bezan? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1804.48s)]
*  Yes, Zan, which means woman in Farsi. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  I had an angel, a musician angel. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1812.6s)]
*  Wow, he opened actually pop studio, which is like, let's say the Iranian A.B. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1818.08s)]
*  Pop studio is the studio where all my idols recorded their albums there. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1827.7600000000002s)]
*  And he opened his Skype while he was recording the best musicians in Iran. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  I did not see them. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1843.16s)]
*  I could just thank them. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1844.96s)]
*  And he actually handle all the process of recording the tracks in Iran, brought it to Israel via, of course, the social media. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  And we matched all the tracks together and we, you know, we wrote together, we composed together. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1855.8s)]
*  That was an extremely exciting journey. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1864.32s)]
*  Wow. So it's amazing. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1869.52s)]
*  So, I mean, because of the power of social media and technology, you're able to collaborate with these Iranian female musicians. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1870.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1876.96s)]
*  You know, thousand, thousand plus miles from from Tel Aviv. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1878.48s)]
*  Yes. And and produce this album. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1882.28s)]
*  And from the album, you started to get this idea that you you wanted to actually perform with these Iranian female musicians. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1885.04s)]
*  I was very rude to ask them first to meet me and my Israeli band to record an album live together, like to meet physically for the first time. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1891.96s)]
*  So it was a year of production, managing, saying with security and Turkish production that really helped me to bring them from Iran to Istanbul. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1904.12s)]
*  We recorded in Istanbul in a recording. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1914.76s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1919.28s)]
*  It was like it was a recording underground studio. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1921.28s)]
*  But it must have been I mean, that's been very scary. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1924.52s)]
*  It must have been scary for these Iranian women to have to leave Iran to go to Turkey for you to go to Turkey as an Israeli. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1926.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1932.92s)]
*  Turkey is a complicated place. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1933.4s)]
*  It took us a year to build it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1936.04s)]
*  And while we were doing it, you know, I was so stressed for these ladies and for my band because it's a lot of responsibility. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1937.72s)]
*  I was asking myself the whole process, why am I doing what I'm doing? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1947.48s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1951.48s)]
*  But the only answer I could give is that it's not about me and it's not about them. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1952.96s)]
*  It's not about only our story. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1959.3999999999999s)]
*  I felt like a messenger through my art, via my art to to tell a story about these two extreme, extreme. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1962.08s)]
*  I don't know how to call these countries, Israel and Iran, extreme opposite countries. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1975.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1980.72s)]
*  But we are the same. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1981.24s)]
*  Well, that's what always has amazed me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1984.24s)]
*  I mean, I've said this a few times on this show is when you actually get beyond the politics, the geopolitics, you know, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1985.96s)]
*  the Islamic Republic and nuclear weapons and terrorism and proxies and missiles, which, of course, has become even more prominent [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=1993.96s)]
*  issue in the past year. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2003.48s)]
*  The when Iranians and Israelis get together, you can see there's this instant connection, cultural, historical, personal, social, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, as a non-Iranian, non-Israeli, when I'm in a room with Iranians and Israelis within five minutes, they're all ignoring me. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2015.24s)]
*  I might as well just leave or be a wallflower because there's an instant cultural connection. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2022.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2029.2s)]
*  And I think you and I were talking about this before we started recording, but at pro-Israel demonstrations around the world now, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2029.68s)]
*  the only other people that are there standing shoulder to shoulder with Jews. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2039.2s)]
*  We definitely share the same blood. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2045.16s)]
*  Yeah, we are sharing the same blood. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2047.04s)]
*  We have the same story and we are not responsible of our story, but we do have responsibility of telling the story. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2049.12s)]
*  And you were saying that I was hosting them on stage. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  That was the next step until we recorded Roya, which means a dream, a vision in Farsi. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2061.92s)]
*  It's a song that I'm promising myself to wave the highest flags that I can with my sisters on the way to our Azadi circle. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2068.28s)]
*  Azadi is freedom, like to sing together. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  Our biggest dream is to sing in Iran and Israel when Iran will open. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2081.48s)]
*  Just as a reminder to the listeners, so the Roya is the theme song for the Iran Breakdown podcast, which you generously allowed us to use. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2086.56s)]
*  I'm very happy about it. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2094.12s)]
*  It's a very inspiring song. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2095.12s)]
*  So talk a little bit about this collaboration that now moves beyond the recording to the live stage and actually getting Iranian women on stage with you on tour in Europe. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2096.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2107.6s)]
*  I mean, a big risk for Iranian women to perform. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2108.52s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that collaboration, the steps you took in order to protect the identities of these women and what came out of that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2112.84s)]
*  What really happened is that when Roya was out and it was in big playlists in France, Germany, England, the hijab revolution started. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  The Women Life Freedom Movement. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2132.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2133.36s)]
*  The Zanzan Degi Azadi. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2134.84s)]
*  And then it was crazy to see my sisters, you know, burning their hijabs, cutting their hairs, running in the streets for protests. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2136.6800000000003s)]
*  And then our music is out. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2144.6400000000003s)]
*  So it felt really, really, really correct to try to take them out of Iran because they they we had so much fun in the studio. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  It was fear and the most frightening thing and the most joyful thing. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2158.0s)]
*  So we recorded 10 days live. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2164.56s)]
*  And then when we said goodbye, we really cried our our hearts out because we really want to meet together. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2167.68s)]
*  And I and I promised them that I would do my best. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2173.8s)]
*  And then hijab protests start and revolution. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2176.6s)]
*  And me and my manager, Dan, we asked every festival manager that hosted me on biggest stage in France, Germany, etc. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2179.96s)]
*  to bring some of them on stage. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2192.76s)]
*  And that was another journey we needed to to have because it was, you know, Iranian cannot leave Iran if they're not having like a visa. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2196.12s)]
*  The only thing that the only place they can move to is or to to travel spontaneously is Turkey. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2206.68s)]
*  So I had festivals in Denmark, France, Cracow, Germany. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2214.56s)]
*  I really wanted to host them on stage. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2219.96s)]
*  So actually, the people from Europe was very courageous and kind of invited and invited them with the artist visa. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2222.16s)]
*  And we were on stage. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2231.96s)]
*  It was the most phenomenal thing I've ever thought that people will from Iran will will will be, you know, able to do. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2233.36s)]
*  And we did it together. We were on stage. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2244.32s)]
*  They were anonymous with a kind of glittery gold hijab. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2246.48s)]
*  And we were performing for 10 to just score. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2252.52s)]
*  I mean, you were on stage with Iranian women who are hiding their faces behind Israeli and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2256.4s)]
*  Iranian musicians. Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2263.28s)]
*  They're having to hide their faces to protect them and their families. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2265.0s)]
*  That was another level of of of being scared. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2268.32s)]
*  And I think the after effect was even harder because we were, you know, we were doing it like we had a lot of, you know, the blood was very, very, let's say, blood, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2272.92s)]
*  hot blood like we were we were very passionate. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2286.92s)]
*  Yeah. We're emotional. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2290.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you. Oh, my God. My English. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2291.88s)]
*  So we were very, very passionate. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2293.6s)]
*  And it was like, OK, we're doing it. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2295.4s)]
*  We felt like a miracle is happening. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2297.4s)]
*  The after effect is that we understood that then when they're they're on their way to Iran and at the airport until the minute that they're not said, OK, Lira, I'm home. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2299.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm safe. I think I I think. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2310.4s)]
*  The the the times I had panic attacks, it was the first time I had panic attacks without even knowing I'm having panic attacks because when it's touching you the first time, you don't know it's happening. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2317.08s)]
*  When it's catching you as like it was. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2329.64s)]
*  On tour, I was with my family and we were flying and they needed to land and I did not have reception. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2333.12s)]
*  I was. I didn't know what to do with myself. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2340.16s)]
*  Well, because I mean, you know, the risk they were taking was not only leaving Iran and performing in live concerts. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2343.6s)]
*  That's enough of a defiance to the Islamic Republic. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2349.08s)]
*  But they're performing with with an Israeli. Yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2352.56s)]
*  Which which is and in a minute that I mean, that is I imagine that while it is a crime within the Islamic Republic. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2355.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, these women could be arrested, jailed, tortured and worse. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2362.16s)]
*  Yes. So I think the after effect was being so frightened about the fact that something will happen to them. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2367.64s)]
*  And we almost had an accident on the airport. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2376.48s)]
*  But thank God everything went well. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2381.04s)]
*  And I must say, and I'm happy to say that two of the ladies who participated in in this beautiful project. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2384.16s)]
*  Left Iran because they had the artist visa in Europe and they had actually the papers that they can work aboard. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2394.7599999999998s)]
*  And they left and they are. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  And they're safe, safe, teaching music, amazing performing. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2408.9599999999996s)]
*  And I'm so happy that they are out of Iran and, you know, leaving their dream. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2415.4399999999996s)]
*  Security of the women who remain in Iran. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2424.44s)]
*  We don't want to get into any details, but hopefully they're also they're safe. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2428.28s)]
*  Now they're safe. Now they're safe. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2434.48s)]
*  Let me ask you about the song Roya. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2436.76s)]
*  We said earlier, it's the theme song for this podcast. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2439.88s)]
*  But of course, it's much more than that. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2443.52s)]
*  I mean, in some respects, it also became a theme song for the woman like freedom movement. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2445.32s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what happened and how the feeling after this journey, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2449.48s)]
*  it is that you went through to hear your song Roya as one of the theme songs of this remarkable protest movement. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2455.68s)]
*  As as Iranian women took other hijabs and defied the Islamic Republic. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2464.84s)]
*  I think because I'm writing about all the lyrics I'm writing is about protests and about women's rights and equal rights [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2470.84s)]
*  and also how beautiful women are and how the world should see women. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2482.56s)]
*  And because Iran cannot, you know, you cannot listen in Iranian radio women's voice. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2492.84s)]
*  So I think the lyrics and the music, everything was really so true for the situation. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2501.76s)]
*  And to watch videos of women, you know, make the revolution in Iran with this song was kind of. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2510.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know how to say it was it was weird and happy at the same time, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2522.04s)]
*  because it was I did not thought that it will go to this place when I recorded the music, you know. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2526.96s)]
*  And also, we felt very all of us, the great musicians from Iran, we felt very, very proud. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2533.28s)]
*  And the next level was when we got also videos with Roya song with Iranian and Israeli flags together. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2540.48s)]
*  And that point, I realized how much they long to peace and how much they wished to to be free and to to be in Israel. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2549.76s)]
*  There is a next next step after October 7th with the Iranians that always makes me [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2565.5200000000004s)]
*  understand that there is much, much more hope than I thought, you know, after October 7th, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2574.72s)]
*  things really, really change, of course, not only music and artistic wise, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  the all perspective and proportion of all of us changed. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's such a weird situation that we've been through with my Iranian friends. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2593.7999999999997s)]
*  For example, I can say that my first great experience was that I was doing a tour with the hostages families in London. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2603.0s)]
*  And I was in many rallies and I saw Iranian and Israeli flags are waving up together at the sky. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2615.28s)]
*  It's not that I never thought that it could happen, but I never thought it will happen in this situation, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2624.2s)]
*  that while they are saying the Iranians, we have the same enemy. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2630.8s)]
*  And the hope that they are their hopes are getting bigger because of October 7th. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2638.2000000000003s)]
*  They are actually the Iranian. They are looking for the situation to solve their problem. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2646.1200000000003s)]
*  They're actually relying on on Israel on us, which thinks that I would never, never happen that will never never sorry, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2653.6s)]
*  thinks that I will never, never think that will happen. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2662.24s)]
*  For example, you know, getting videos on October 7th and 8 and 9, just just after the war started from Canada, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2665.88s)]
*  from Iranian people holding Israeli flags in their hands, they're not Jewish. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2677.36s)]
*  They are understanding the situation that we can be a very, very powerful together. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2683.36s)]
*  So I've been in rallies in London and in Paris and I see Iranian and Israeli flags together during 24. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2689.04s)]
*  I had my concerts in in in Europe. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2696.48s)]
*  Let's say 80 percent of my concert got got canceled because I'm Israeli and there was a lot of security [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  problems and festivals and venues really, really got scared for bringing us to like Israeli banned to to Europe. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2712.12s)]
*  But I traveled, I was flying, you know, every month to Berlin, to London, to Paris. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2722.44s)]
*  And in every concert, I saw Israeli and Iranian flags in my concert. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2728.7999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, just for listeners who are not Iranian, who may not fully appreciate these are not the flags of the Islamic Republic. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2734.64s)]
*  No, no. And also these are not not Iranian and these are not Israeli. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2741.04s)]
*  And you know what I mean? Like people who understand and knows, knows my music and my fans understand the connection that's happening during this war with the Israeli and the Iranians. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2748.8s)]
*  So they brought flags together. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2761.56s)]
*  Normally, I hold the Iranian flag in my concert when I'm speaking about the women's and singing about Roya and Zan Bezan. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2765.08s)]
*  It's an Iranian flag and with big letters of women, life, freedom, Zanz and Deghi Azadi. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2777.56s)]
*  I'm I'm actually explaining to people that women in Iran are still muted. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2784.04s)]
*  Most of the people doesn't know what's going on in Iran, which is weird, but I'm actually giving them the awareness of the situation and what am I fighting for? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2790.36s)]
*  What am I singing off? Because they don't understand the word in Farsi. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2799.96s)]
*  You know, it's like global music. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2803.4s)]
*  They can hear Algerian, Iraqi, Turkish, but they don't understand the words. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2806.6s)]
*  So I'm explaining them. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2812.36s)]
*  So they understand and so they understood the situation of of both of us, Iranian and Israeli side. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2814.56s)]
*  So they started to bring the flags together, which is. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2823.44s)]
*  I never thought it would happen. So this is this is people in the audience are coming to the shows. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2828.4s)]
*  Yeah, not not Israelis necessarily not Iranian identifying with the story and trying to make peace. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2832.64s)]
*  And and the next level was when. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2839.68s)]
*  When Iran attacked Israel a couple of months ago, I didn't know that I was home. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2845.12s)]
*  I think I was cooking. My husband was in the theater. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2851.6s)]
*  He was on stage. Girls were asleep and suddenly I'm looking at my phone and I see my phone is ringing and lots of lots of thousands of messages. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2854.56s)]
*  Instagram, Telegram. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2865.04s)]
*  What's going on? And my friends from Iran, are you OK? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2867.28s)]
*  You can say what's going on? Iran is attacking Israel. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2870.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like what? What the hell is going on here? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2873.92s)]
*  Wow. So you learn from your friends inside Iran that the Islamic Republic was attacking you and your country, which is crazy. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2877.36s)]
*  Like, I mean, you may you may have gotten an earlier warning than than even more. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2885.44s)]
*  Sad got about the attack that was coming. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2891.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes. No, interesting. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2893.92s)]
*  And then it took a couple of hours for the rockets to. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2895.36s)]
*  Right. All the missiles and the muscles and like, oh, it's not happening. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2898.4s)]
*  Not yet. Not yet. I'm fine. I'm fine. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2902.32s)]
*  And but your Iranian friends reaching out to you from Iran definitely to see if you're OK. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2905.36s)]
*  Definitely. Right. And that's just the human dimension of the story that they get so lost in the discussions about geopolitics and security and terrorism, as I said, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2909.6000000000004s)]
*  nuclear weapons and the rest of it that we have to focus on. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2919.6s)]
*  But, you know, again, I wanted you to come on the show. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2923.28s)]
*  They rise to really talk about this personal dimension, this cultural dimension, this artistic dimension of this relationship between between people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2925.44s)]
*  Yeah. Not between governments. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2932.16s)]
*  And again, not not not about geopolitics, but about about art and and the human connection. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2934.4s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about the song Roya. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2941.44s)]
*  What? What is the song about aspirationally and why again, did it become sort of one of the theme songs of woman life freedom? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2944.7999999999997s)]
*  And I find I just find it so fascinating that a song that again was co-produced between an Israeli Iranian and Iranian musicians, females, voice of hope, dreams becomes this this mantra for Iranian women on the streets to women like freedom. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2955.4399999999996s)]
*  A little bit more about that, because our listeners are always hearing the theme song. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2974.0s)]
*  So what is what is Roya mean? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2978.48s)]
*  Roya is a fantasy. It's a dream. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2980.16s)]
*  Right. And that's a popular Iranian female name as well as well. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2983.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great name. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2987.68s)]
*  So actually, it's the theme song of this album. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2991.28s)]
*  The whole album is speaking about a situation between us, our dreams, our promises to each other, our faith, our courage to to on our way to as a day to freedom, to peace. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=2995.04s)]
*  When I wrote Roya, it was very clear to me that this is like a promise song to myself and to my sister that will make anything to to be free together and to perform together. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3011.2s)]
*  Because most of the time in my concerts, people are waving with flags. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3027.2799999999997s)]
*  I started this song with waving flags that I promised myself to wave my biggest, highest flags for freedom until we will flag it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3034.56s)]
*  How do you say it? Until we will wave it together in Israel and in Iran. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3048.4s)]
*  I think the fantasy of building this album, it was a fantasy to me as well. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3055.04s)]
*  And I was like referring it metaphorically, like if I will manage to create this dream, this Roya and to record this album, this is like the song. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3063.52s)]
*  I mean, it's going to happen and the album happened. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3077.04s)]
*  Now we just need to make it happen for real. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3080.0s)]
*  And I have a great story about this song because we've recorded it live and with the tar and guitars and also with the percussions. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3084.4s)]
*  And it was a great experience to record it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3097.36s)]
*  But the last day, the 10th day of recording in Istanbul studio, we arrived, the Israelis and the Iranian with our suitcases to the recording studio. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3101.2000000000003s)]
*  And we have to go to the airport and to say goodbye. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3112.72s)]
*  And I was telling Uri, my producer, if we have even 10 minutes left in the studio, let's have a women's version, just the women unplugged and just recorded. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3117.2s)]
*  So at the end of the album, we have the last track of the acoustic, unplugged version of Roya. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3132.3199999999997s)]
*  And it was the most magical thing I've ever done because we were the girls from my band and the girls from Iran. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3143.8399999999997s)]
*  And I know it sounds very like when you can imagine like Israeli girls, you imagine them like hipsters. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3157.68s)]
*  But when you imagine like Iranian girls, you see them with hijab. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  So no, they were like coming inside the studio, actually, with long blonde hair, a Mickey Mouse t shirt and a beer in their heads. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3171.6s)]
*  And it's like that we are the same. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3183.12s)]
*  I have to like imagine you the the picture of recording this Roya acoustic version version. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3185.2799999999997s)]
*  So we've recorded it. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3197.12s)]
*  And while we were recording it, we actually started to cry. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3198.8s)]
*  And at the end of the song, I couldn't even keep going and singing the last sentence. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3203.92s)]
*  And we are crying together. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3212.08s)]
*  And actually, we can hear it in the in the song. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3214.16s)]
*  And we kind of promised to ourselves, like we promised in the song, that it won't be the last time we're seeing each other. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3218.24s)]
*  And I don't know if you know if I told you, but I'm I'm I'm actually recording on video and cameras the whole process with them for years. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3225.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm producing a documentary movie. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3241.2s)]
*  And I'm not afraid to say even here that I'm sure that Iran break down. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3246.3999999999996s)]
*  And the last scene of our movie will be this Roya song. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3254.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, we're performing in Tehran and in Tel Aviv, in Iran and Israel together, holding hands. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3260.0s)]
*  I have the guts that Iran will break down very soon. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3268.16s)]
*  Well, I think that's a wonderful moment to end on, because it's a it's a constant theme of the Iran breakdown that we're not just breaking down the issue, but we're breaking down the regime episode by episode, voice by voice. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3273.04s)]
*  Yes, I do believe in it. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3286.64s)]
*  I think the Islamic Republic has never been weaker, never been weaker internally, economically, socially, politically. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3288.16s)]
*  Millions of Iranians. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3296.88s)]
*  Yeah, millions of Iranians have been on the streets since 2009, yelling death to the dictator, asking American presidents, are you with us? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3298.48s)]
*  Are you with the dictator? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3306.0s)]
*  I think your your government has finally, after many years, appreciated that supporting the Iranian people has got to be a central pillar of Israeli strategy. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3307.76s)]
*  And we've talked on this podcast in general terms, not in detail, because it's a public podcast being listened to inside Iran by many of the right people, but some of the the wrong people. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  So we don't want to get into too much detail. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3328.96s)]
*  But the Israeli government and security establishment has adopted this strategy of maximum support for the Iranian people as part of maximum pressure on the regime. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3331.04s)]
*  And I hope that as a result, your friends in Iran and other brave Iranians understand that, you know, it's today that actually it's Israel that's that's really supporting them. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3342.3199999999997s)]
*  We're going to work to make sure that the United States joins that effort. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3353.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's but it's Israel. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3357.2s)]
*  And and also Israel has gone after this axis of misery. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3359.04s)]
*  Khamenei calls it the axis of resistance, but it's an axis of misery. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3364.0s)]
*  And in the past year has done severe damage to this axis of misery by attacking Hezbollah and Hamas and helping down the Assad regime and neutralizing the threat from the Iraqi Shiite militias and obviously dealing with a Houthi threat, which I know you're probably having to run to shelters regularly with your family when Houthi missiles are fired at Israel. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3368.32s)]
*  But the good news is this regime is on its last legs and it's not just going to be missiles and drones and planes that bring it down, but ultimately, it's the Iranian people that are going to bring down the Islamic Republic. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3393.6s)]
*  And then there'll be a free Iran. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3408.24s)]
*  And then, as we say, next year in a free Iran, yes. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3409.92s)]
*  And then you can we can all go to your concerts with your Iranian friends and watch this in Tehran. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  That that's the dream. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3421.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the dream. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3422.64s)]
*  That's the right. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3423.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for for having me here. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3424.1600000000003s)]
*  And also thank you for much for everything you're doing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3426.48s)]
*  Because when I speak like this to people, people are, you know, looking at me very weird and saying, oh, you're talking nonsense. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3429.44s)]
*  You're not the machine. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3437.04s)]
*  I said, I don't I am not the machine, but I have got and I have faith and I know my brothers and my sisters from Iran and I know they will break it down. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3438.2400000000002s)]
*  And I know that this is we have been through we have been through so such a crazy and bad times and. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3449.2s)]
*  Something will have to change for good. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3461.6s)]
*  And that's the that's the crisis that will make it happen. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3464.16s)]
*  I believe I believe that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3468.88s)]
*  I mean, you spent a lot of time in Tehran. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3470.08s)]
*  I have as well, but I grew up in Tehran, Toronto, Canada, Tehran, which has a huge Persian community, incredibly successful, wonderful. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3472.7200000000003s)]
*  And I've had the absolute privilege of spending a lot of time with with Iranians outside of Iran. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  You have to check your backgrounds. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3491.28s)]
*  Maybe you have some Iranian. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe maybe I was thought it was Lithuanian, but there may be some connection to the ancient to ancient Persia. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3493.84s)]
*  Your eyes. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3500.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3501.12s)]
*  It was wonderful to have you so wonderful to see you and we're going to do this again. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3501.44s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm I really hope can I see Roya for a second? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3506.3999999999996s)]
*  Wow, that would be like unplugged. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3510.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3512.96s)]
*  It's morning and I didn't do my vocals, but I feel like I need to sing it. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3513.44s)]
*  He read the Shambaat. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3529.68s)]
*  You're at peace. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3531.44s)]
*  But I'm bad. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3533.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3536.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3539.6s)]
*  Wow, beautiful. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3546.3999999999996s)]
*  And thanks to us. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3547.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3549.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's it for this episode of Iran breakdown. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3550.72s)]
*  Today, we heard how the Rouse Charfi, an Israeli artist with deep Iranian roots, is using music as a weapon. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3553.2s)]
*  Against silence and fear inside the Islamic Republic. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3559.68s)]
*  Her collaborations with brave women inside Iran and her powerful Persian language songs are proof that even under the weight of tyranny, art can punch back. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3562.8799999999997s)]
*  Remember our podcast theme music Roya means dream, but in Rouse's hands, it's not just a dream of freedom. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3572.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a warning to the regime. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3579.44s)]
*  The voices you're trying to silence are only getting louder. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3580.96s)]
*  So this isn't just music. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3584.96s)]
*  It's defiance. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3586.56s)]
*  And it's one more crack in the foundation of the Islamic Republic. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3587.92s)]
*  I'm Mark Dubowitz. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3591.28s)]
*  Thanks for listening. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3592.48s)]
*  This is the Iran breakdown. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3593.44s)]
*  Please join us for next episode as we continue to break it down. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rogoc8gtPE&t=3595.28s)]
