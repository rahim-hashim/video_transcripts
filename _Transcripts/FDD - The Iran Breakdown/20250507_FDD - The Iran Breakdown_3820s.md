# Bonus Breakdown | Iran Nuclear Talks — Deal or No Deal? (feat. Barak Ravid)
**FDD - The Iran Breakdown:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU)
*  He said, yes, the Iranians are proposing a joint venture, nuclear energy, uranium enrichment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=0.0s)]
*  I said, that's all great, but it will happen when unicorns will fly to Iran, Donald Trump on their back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=6.4s)]
*  If it's not simple, it means it's not going to happen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=14.24s)]
*  Welcome to the Iran Breakdown. I'm your host, Mark Dugowitz. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=19.36s)]
*  Today I'm joined by Barak Ravid, one of the most connected and respected journalists covering Israeli diplomacy and US-Middle East relations. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=22.6s)]
*  Barak is a senior correspondent for Axios, a contributor to CNN, and writes for Israel's Waller News and Yidio Dachronon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=29.4s)]
*  His reporting has earned him top honors, including the White House Correspondents Association's Aldo Beckman Award for Overall Excellence in White House coverage in 2024. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=36.04s)]
*  He recognized his deeply sourced reporting during critical moments in US foreign policy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=45.4s)]
*  He also received an honorable mention from the National Press Club for his piece, Biden's Peace, detailing US efforts to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=49.92s)]
*  Barak is the author of Trump's piece, The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East, a behind-the-scenes account of the Trump administration's diplomatic breakthroughs with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  The book features exclusive interviews with President Trump and other key players. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=69.88s)]
*  It offers unprecedented insights into one of the most consequential foreign policy shifts in recent history. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=73.96s)]
*  In this episode, we're going to unpack the latest developments in the Iran nuclear talks, what's happening behind closed doors, the strategies of the Trump administration, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=79.16s)]
*  Khamenei's maneuvers, the roles of Israel Congress in the Gulf States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=87.68s)]
*  So let's break it down. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=91.64s)]
*  Wonderful to have you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=94.4s)]
*  It's great to be here in a podcast hosted by the most hated man on, you know, for both MAGA Republicans and Obama Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=95.76s)]
*  Well, that's fine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  Actually, a lot of friends, a lot of MAGA Republican friends, a lot of Obama Democratic friends. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  But there is certainly there does seem to be an isolationist wing of the right and a anti-Israel wing of the left that does despise me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=128.12s)]
*  I have to say it's like it's sort of, you know, because I, you know, doing the while covering the JCPOA, the negotiations that led to the JCPOA, I remember how you were, you know, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=128.4s)]
*  enemy number one for the administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's sort of like, you know, we're 10 years later and, you know, you basically haven't changed any of your opinions, but you found yourself now in the same situation with a new administration, just from the other side of the political map, which I think tells at least to me a lot about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=142.96s)]
*  What happened to the Iran discussion in America? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=164.92s)]
*  And I'm saying it as a, you know, sort of like I can I see myself as sort of outside observer because, you know, I'm not American. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=169.28s)]
*  I'm Israeli that who came here to the US and is like sort of like watching it all as well, almost as if I'm watching National Geographic. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=176.96s)]
*  So it's really interesting to see this development and. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=186.8s)]
*  And it's one of those cases that you tell me, but you didn't even you didn't even know that you were so sophisticated as, you know, leading a campaign against the Iran nuclear talks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=191.36s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, Brock. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  I would say the one fundamental difference between 2015 and 2025 is in 2015, I opposed President Obama's Iran deal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=207.68s)]
*  I was in opposition to the administration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=214.8s)]
*  This summer I'm actually in full support of President Trump's policy and his national security teams policy, as well as Senate Republicans and leading members of Trump's base, including key evangelical leaders. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  So you had a story just a couple of days ago in Axios about exactly this, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=234.0s)]
*  That President Trump had come out very clearly on Meet the Press. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=239.0s)]
*  And he said, my policy is dismantlement. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=242.56s)]
*  And that, of course, has been echoed by Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz, Pete Hegseth, Steve Witkoff and leading Senate and House Republicans. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=245.12s)]
*  So I feel like I'm like in 2015, where I was in full opposition to the Obama administration and the president, this time in full support of the president and his position. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  It just seems like there's a certain wing of his base, this isolationist wing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=263.24s)]
*  They're actually in opposition to the president's policy, not me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=271.36s)]
*  What was interesting in that NBC interview that you mentioned is that you could see how there were both sides of the argument were, you know, taking the fact that using the fact that Trump sometimes says contradictory things within two minutes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=272.08s)]
*  And each of them said, you see, I mean, one part said, you see total dismantlement and the other side says, yes, but afterwards he said that he's open to Iran having a civilian nuclear program. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=294.64s)]
*  Therefore, he's not really in support of total dismantlement. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=308.84s)]
*  And it just seems to me that at the moment, and I think I told you this in another form, that both sides of the argument are much more advanced in their thinking than the talks themselves, which is also kind of funny how everyone are like, you know, the. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=313.12s)]
*  I mean, there are always several clocks and the sort of political discourse slash media discourse is always this clock is always faster than the real clock, which is where the talks are, which is much slower and much more like the political than the media. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=336.32s)]
*  The discourse is like, you know, like Formula One and the talks are like, you know, watching paint dry. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=358.96s)]
*  It was a good analogy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  Before we dive into the talks, because I want to get your insight. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you've got great sources and you're obviously reporting on this very closely. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=372.68s)]
*  I do think his comment on Meet the Press, NBC News was very interesting and I actually fully support both pieces of it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=376.76s)]
*  I fully support the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=383.64s)]
*  On the other hand, I do support that Iran can have a civilian nuclear program, like 23 other countries in the world who buy their fuel rods from abroad, who don't have domestic enrichment, who don't have domestic reprocessing of plutonium. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=387.68s)]
*  And in fact, Iran today has a nuclear reactor called Boucher. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=403.0s)]
*  And by the way, they buy their fuel rods for Boucher from the Russians and they've never used any of the enriched uranium that they produced in massive quantities to actually fuel this nuclear reactor, which puts a lie to Iran's claim that they need enriched uranium on their soil for civilian nuclear energy. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=407.44s)]
*  They certainly don't. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=426.2s)]
*  They haven't used it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=427.56s)]
*  They've been using Russian fuel rods. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=428.32s)]
*  And I think when Secretary Rubio came out just before President Trump's statement, he made it very clear there is a pathway to a civilian energy program. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=430.32s)]
*  There's just no domestic enrichment, no reprocessing, no need for centrifuges, no need for deeply buried underground facilities in a tons of fordough that enrich uranium, no need for all of the fissile material and infrastructure that could be used to build nuclear weapons. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=439.88s)]
*  Iran, you can be like 23 other countries and have these fuel rods. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=454.52s)]
*  By the way, I fully support that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  So again, I support both aspects of what the president said. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=459.68s)]
*  And we'll see as the negotiations continue and the debate continues, whether these isolationist voices in the Trump coalition are prepared to continue supporting the president or are they going to continue doing what I fear they are doing right now is undermining the president's leverage and Steve [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=463.68s)]
*  Witkoff leverage at the negotiating table. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  But let's let's jump into what's going on. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=483.16s)]
*  So it's like watching paint dry. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=485.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=487.92s)]
*  But what is going on in the negotiations? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=488.52s)]
*  Not anything, not much, not much. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  That's that's the thing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=494.4s)]
*  You know, at the beginning, there was in President Trump's letter to Iranian leader Khamenei, he set a two month deadline. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=495.56s)]
*  Then people said, are those two months? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=505.08s)]
*  When do you start? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  When do you start counting? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  Do you start counting from March 7th when the letter was delivered? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you start counting from when the talks in the first round of talks took place? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  What's the date? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=522.04s)]
*  And until now, I'm not sure. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=523.36s)]
*  I think it's from the first round of talks, which means that four out of eight weeks are behind us. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=527.28s)]
*  It's still unclear when the next round of talks is going to take place. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  Um, there's the president's visit to the Middle East. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=542.04s)]
*  That's obviously, you know, will take a lot of time, both, you know, the preparations and the visit itself. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=545.72s)]
*  There might be I spoke on Monday night with White House envoy Steve Witkoff. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=552.36s)]
*  He said that they're trying to hold a fourth round of talks over the weekend. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=559.08s)]
*  Um, Iranian press reported it might take place on Sunday, um, in Muscat, in Oman, which makes sense. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=567.4s)]
*  If Trump is arriving on Tuesday to Saudi Arabia, it makes sense to for Witkoff to already be in the region. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=576.68s)]
*  But even if there will be a fourth round of talks, we are in a very, very early stage, meaning the, the parties didn't really start [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  discussing the actual, um, details of a possible deal. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=596.56s)]
*  It is still we're still in the place where the Iranians made some proposals and the US has been studying them, analyzing them, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=603.76s)]
*  preparing some sort of like, I don't know if you want to call it, you know, requests for clarifications, answers, counterpropos. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=616.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't know how to call it, but it's preparing something to give back to the Iranians. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=625.84s)]
*  This, I think, will happen if there will be a fourth round of talks, but it is still very much, you know, like macro issues. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=632.44s)]
*  It's still not, um, you know, a detailed technical negotiations like we saw in 2015 over the, um, JCPOA and even in 2013 over the JPOA, the interim agreement. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=644.36s)]
*  So if what it tells me, uh, is that the two month deadline is not really relevant anymore. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=660.76s)]
*  I think it is, it has become an aspirational deadline that, um, if it means that it's 12 weeks instead of eight weeks, nobody's gonna make a big deal out of it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=670.04s)]
*  Uh, and if there will be progress, as at least president Trump has said, uh, if this progress continues, then. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=685.88s)]
*  I think this could continue for, for a long time. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=696.0400000000001s)]
*  We have to remember to get the JCPOA. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=699.64s)]
*  It was three years of negotiations, so it's not something that you can get. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=703.1600000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, even if the Iranians said tomorrow, okay, dismantlement, we agree just to, you know, to build a protocol of how to do it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=710.6s)]
*  You're talking about months of negotiations. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=723.08s)]
*  So I think this is this issue. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=726.2s)]
*  Um, again, if it continues to make progress, if there's crisis, that's another thing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=729.96s)]
*  But if it continues to be on both sides, the feeling that does progress, it could take at least at least a year. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=734.6s)]
*  So, yeah, I certainly hope that if they agree on which would be which, which, why, why doesn't matter. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=745.12s)]
*  It matters because in October, the snapback clause of the 2015 nuclear deal expires. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=751.0s)]
*  So if the talks will continue, the U.S. and its European partners will have to figure out what to do with the snapback because they cannot allow the snapback to expire. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=759.88s)]
*  So this leads me at least to think that they will have to be. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=774.0s)]
*  Again, if talks continue to make progress, as both sides are saying right now, if that's the case, they'll have to have there will have to be some sort of an interim agreement that deals at least at least with this issue of the snapback. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=780.2800000000001s)]
*  So, well, first of all, I agree with you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=796.96s)]
*  We're early in the negotiations and there's a lot to discuss. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=800.44s)]
*  I actually agree with President Trump. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=803.04s)]
*  It's fairly a simple deal. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=804.16s)]
*  I mean, if Iran must agree to dismantlement and there is a 60 page report that FDD has put out that details what dismantlement is and how dismantlement occurs. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=805.36s)]
*  And so there's not that much to negotiate with JCPOA. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  It was an incredibly complicated deal, precisely because the Obama administration conceded a massive nuclear infrastructure to Iran and then was looking at ways of restricting that over time with sunset provisions under which those [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=819.7199999999999s)]
*  restrictions would expire. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=832.56s)]
*  So it was painstaking negotiation by technical experts to try to figure out how can you stop Iran from breaking out to a nuclear weapon when you giving them the very nuclear infrastructure that allows them to do so. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  I agree with President Trump. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=845.92s)]
*  It's a simple deal on dismantlement. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  But my question to you is dismantlement, no enrichment. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=848.5999999999999s)]
*  The day after President Trump's interview Monday this week, Abbas Araqchi, the Iranian foreign minister and lead Iran nuclear negotiator came out with a withering post on X attacking, by the way, FDD, but also attacking Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and really implicitly attacking President Trump's position on dismantlement, making it very clear that that is unacceptable. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=853.36s)]
*  That is an absolute red line. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=876.5200000000001s)]
*  And enrichment on Iranian soil is the condition, the number one condition for the Ayatollah and for the regime. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=878.08s)]
*  So, Barack, I want to ask you on this because there's been a lot of media and political discussion and you say that that's getting well ahead of the negotiations. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  But on three occasions, Steve Witkoff had publicly said that he's willing to give 3.67% enrichment to Iran, which would then be essentially conceding the number one demand that the Iranians have and would also be effectively adopting the framework of JCPOA. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=898.8s)]
*  Then Secretary Rubio came out and explained that in fact what Steve Witkoff meant was not to give them domestic enrichment, but to give them this civilian nuclear option where they buy enriched fuel rods from abroad for their reactors. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  And actually, Steve Witkoff clarified this in a post saying, no, exactly, dismantlement, no enrichment. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=933.52s)]
*  Very confusing messages. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=941.44s)]
*  It seems to have been clarified by the president. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=943.36s)]
*  But what do you make of that? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you think that the US negotiating team has conceded enrichment on Iranian soil to the Iranians as part of these initial discussions? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=946.76s)]
*  Or do you think that Secretary Rubio is right? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=956.52s)]
*  That's what Witkoff really meant when he talked about enrichment. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=959.64s)]
*  Look, I don't know if I don't know exactly what the administration's position is on enrichment in Iran because there are, as you said, there were several statements made. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=963.52s)]
*  And I even I even think that because somebody, you know, somebody gave me like an explanation why dismantlement does not necessarily contradict some enrichment in Iran, which was I don't know how that physically can can go together. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=980.28s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1004.64s)]
*  So I think, to be honest, at the moment, it feels to me that the US position hasn't been set yet on on this very crucial part of the negotiations, because it's it's it's one or zero. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1006.12s)]
*  It's it does nothing like it's either you allow Iran to have some enrichment or you don't. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1027.84s)]
*  It's not there's no way around it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1034.72s)]
*  And I don't think a final position has has been made. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1037.64s)]
*  I mean, you could, for example, and I'm just speculating here. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1042.16s)]
*  I don't know if this would work or ever be acceptable to any party. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1045.8000000000002s)]
*  But you could, for example, have a US Iranian enrichment facility in Kazakhstan, right under international safeguards. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1048.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you can produce as fuel rods. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1056.64s)]
*  And those fuel rods then are sent to Iran for their Boucher reactor or whatever other civilian nuclear reactors they want to set up. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1059.2s)]
*  And it's under US supervision, IAEA safeguards. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1066.4s)]
*  The Iranians could then claim they are still enriching, not on their soil, but enriching. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1070.2s)]
*  But, of course, the enrichment is for fuel rods. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1074.68s)]
*  And you could you could design it so that it's proliferation proof. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1077.24s)]
*  It's you know, somebody told me, yes, and you can also have a said, yes, the Iranians are proposing a joint venture, a joint US Iranian venture. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1082.24s)]
*  For, you know, nuclear energy and and uranium enrichment. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1094.0s)]
*  And he said, yeah, why not? Why not build like, you know, like what the Biden administration discussed with Saudi Arabia for a US controlled facility, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1100.16s)]
*  enrichment facility in Iran that the Iranians only get the product? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1110.12s)]
*  And I said, that's all great, but it will happen when unicorns will fly to Iran with Donald Trump on their back. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1114.24s)]
*  I mean, it's like what is if it's not simple, it means it's not going to happen. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1124.6s)]
*  Like it's it's so I think it's it's at the end of the day, a very simple question. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  Do you agree to uranium enrichment in Iran and then negotiate the scope or you say, no, it's zero. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1137.1599999999999s)]
*  And then it must be dismantled. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1148.04s)]
*  And I think that's what Donald Trump has said. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  It said he dismantle it means no enrichment capability, no centrifuges. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1151.12s)]
*  It means shutting down the deeply buried underground, the tons enrichment facility, the even more deeply buried underground for dough facility. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1156.6s)]
*  By the way, this new facility that I know that Israelis call Salaheen, which is at Natanz, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1164.92s)]
*  which is going to go 100 meters underground, even deeper than at times in Fordow and is going to be heavily fortified with with concrete, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  making it maybe impossible for us and Israel to destroy it from the air. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1177.48s)]
*  And so if you if you adopt that framework and you're in JCPOA, you're effectively conceding Iran those capabilities. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  If you adopt Donald Trump's dismantlement conception, then all of that has to be ripped out. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1191.72s)]
*  And Donald Trump, remember, in the Oval Office a couple of months ago, said something to the effect of that under US supervision, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1197.4s)]
*  Iran will blow up its own facilities or effectively we're going to blow it up for them. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1204.64s)]
*  Right. So this is not this is not the first time that he's talked about dismantlement to two or three days ago. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1209.16s)]
*  He he made that clear right from the beginning. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  I agree. But then I always ask myself the question if that's the case and if I think you'll agree with me that the Iranians will not dismantle the nuclear program. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1217.08s)]
*  I don't agree. You think they will? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1229.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that the biggest mistake we can make is to think that 2025 is 2015. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  And what I mean by that, because we started talking about the differences, is that to be fair to Barack Obama in 2015, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1238.0s)]
*  when they were negotiating that agreement, the United States had leverage. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1244.0s)]
*  It had economic leverage, right? The Iranian economy was suffering. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1247.44s)]
*  But the entire Iranian infrastructure, its capabilities was in place. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1251.48s)]
*  It had Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Iraqi Shia militias, the Houthis, air defenses, ballistic missile production capability. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  And a president who clearly wasn't prepared to use military force was clearly prepared to block Israel from using military force. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1265.68s)]
*  And so all Obama had was economic leverage. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1272.84s)]
*  And that was leverage that proved to be insufficient to get a zero enrichment deal. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1275.72s)]
*  But, Barack, you've been covering this in detail. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1281.4399999999998s)]
*  2025 is very different. Everything that I just described has either been destroyed by the Israelis or severely degraded. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1284.1999999999998s)]
*  We we we the United States and Israel have way more leverage today than we did in 2015. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1292.12s)]
*  And we should stop negotiating with ourselves and saying, you know what, the Iranians will never accept this because you know what the Iranians never say? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1298.96s)]
*  They never say, you know, the Americans will never accept that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1306.64s)]
*  We better adjust our position to compromise. That's true. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1310.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm I'm just, you know, giving my my own assessment that I really I do not see the Iranians coming in with C4 explosives and blowing up their own nuclear. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1314.2s)]
*  Facilities. The only way in my opinion that those nuclear facilities will be blown up is through a military action by either Israel or the US or Israel and the US. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1328.92s)]
*  I just don't see any other way that you can dismantle. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  Let me give you a scenario and I'd love you to respond to this because if I don't want to give any clues and tips to the Iranian nuclear negotiators. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1352.32s)]
*  But if I'm thinking that Donald Trump is gone in three and a half years, if I'm thinking that the next president of the United States, either a Republican or a Democrat, is not going to be willing to use American power against Iran, then I'm going to do a deal, a three and a half year deal. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1359.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to wait Trump out. In which case, it doesn't even matter what I concede. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1374.96s)]
*  I could concede dismantlement. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1378.92s)]
*  It's like, OK, IAEA come in, we'll do a Libya model, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1380.4s)]
*  Take out the infrastructure, take out the centrifuges, close the facilities, take out our enrichment and reprocessing capability, shut down in some way our strategic missile capability, including our ICBM capability. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1384.92s)]
*  Sure, I'll concede all that. Then in return, I want hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1399.28s)]
*  And I want a treaty that says no US president will withdraw from this. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1403.92s)]
*  Then I wait three and a half years, Trump's out, and I start rebuilding all that infrastructure. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  And what am I worried about? I'm not worried about the US using American power. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1414.3200000000002s)]
*  And I'm probably counting on the fact that the US will block Israel from using military force. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1418.16s)]
*  So in my mind, there is a deal that the self-proclaimed flexible supreme leader who talks about this in wrestling metaphors, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1422.3600000000001s)]
*  but also cites Islamic history to talk about why compromise is sometimes required, could concede on enrichment knowing that Donald Trump's gone in three and a half years. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1432.24s)]
*  That's I'm not saying it's impossible. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1441.2s)]
*  OK, I'm just saying that this is a lot of times. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1444.32s)]
*  And now I'm bringing my Israeli point of view to discussions. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1449.36s)]
*  A lot of times, Bibi would do something and everybody say, oh, you know, this is this sophisticated way and he's a magician and he's doing this. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1456.96s)]
*  And if it's if it if he succeeds, he's a genius. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1467.48s)]
*  If he fails, no, no, you don't understand how genius he is because he failed here because his plan is completely different. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1471.92s)]
*  You know, I think we sometimes sort of like give too much credit to the Iranians, especially to Hamenei. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1480.76s)]
*  Hamenei has made massive, massive, massive mistakes over the last two years, like. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1491.56s)]
*  Crazy mistakes that led him to where he is now. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1500.44s)]
*  So and I'm not saying he can't make those mistakes again. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying that if if we say that he's not stupid and that he's not irrational and that he's, you know, super smart and rational player and, you know, thinks strategically. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1509.24s)]
*  Then then what it means is that he'll say. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1523.08s)]
*  I cannot miscalculate again and to say that no other president in the future will take military action against Iran or will not allow Israel. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1528.76s)]
*  We were close. We were close. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1542.36s)]
*  We can argue how close to Joe Biden supporting a military strike against Iran during the transition. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1544.72s)]
*  OK, it was definitely closer than any other Democratic president in history. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1552.8s)]
*  It was and it could have happened if if if there were signs that the run was was going to 90 percent. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1559.84s)]
*  No, then it would definitely happen. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1565.16s)]
*  I'm saying even without that, there were discussions in the White House and and serious people supported a military action against Iran. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1566.96s)]
*  Not only if they go to 90 percent, but just because everything you mentioned that that's there's an opportunity. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1576.84s)]
*  Iran is weak. Don't kick the can down the road. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1583.8s)]
*  Make it your legacy. There were serious people supporting it within the administration. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1586.48s)]
*  It's interesting. Why did Prime Minister Netanyahu with that opportunity in the transition, knowing that Biden was coming, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1592.52s)]
*  uncertainty over sorry, uncertainty over that Trump was coming, uncertainty of what President Trump would do. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1600.84s)]
*  Why not take that opportunity in the transition and hit the nuclear facilities? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  I think he made a mistake. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1609.2s)]
*  And why do you think he made a mistake? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1611.2s)]
*  Not by the way, not for the first time. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1613.04s)]
*  He made a mistake. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1616.52s)]
*  And was his calculation that not to worry, President Trump will be coming in and will have even more backing, more support from the United States. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1618.28s)]
*  President Trump will for sure back military force against Iran's nuclear facilities and may even do it himself. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1625.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that's the message that Netanyahu's confidant, Ron Dermer, got from Trump himself when he met him in Mar-a-Lago a few days after the election. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1632.76s)]
*  It's it's not a guy, you know, it's not a crazy thought. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1644.32s)]
*  You know, it's not like, oh, how did how did Netanyahu think that that's what's going to happen? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1649.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not, you know, it's not crazy. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1654.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1656.28s)]
*  There was, I really think from everything I know, OK, and it's not an opinion, it's it's I'm just giving the facts of what happened in November twenty twenty four. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1658.9199999999998s)]
*  There was a window of opportunity for a an Israeli strike in Iran supported by the Biden administration, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1672.12s)]
*  because there are certain elements of technical elements of such an operation that Israel cannot do on its own. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1682.88s)]
*  It needs not a lot of US support, but some critical US support that cannot go forward without it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think the plans were there. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1699.0400000000002s)]
*  The operational plan was there. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1702.5600000000002s)]
*  But I think also one of the reasons it didn't happen is because at that point. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1705.2s)]
*  There was zero trust between Netanyahu and Biden. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1714.16s)]
*  And, you know, we can it's a whole different discussion, but I think, you know, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1720.64s)]
*  Netanyahu brought his relationship with Biden to a point where it was just very hard for both sides to agree on such an issue, even though on the merits of it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1726.16s)]
*  There was not a big disagreement, but I think. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  Just the politics and the bad blood was one of the key things that got in the way. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  So fast forward to today, May twenty twenty five. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1754.36s)]
*  Joe Biden's out of office. Donald Trump is in office. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1758.8s)]
*  Nuclear talks are ongoing, as we've discussed, even though paint is drying. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1761.24s)]
*  What is Netanyahu's position today? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1767.72s)]
*  I mean, with respect to his options, with respect to Israeli military options, with respect to the he seems to be getting full support from President Trump on on Gaza and Hamas. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, strong military support, all of the munitions and systems that had been delayed or semi embargoed under Biden have all flowed to now to the IDF. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1781.04s)]
*  He's given Israel really strong backing on on a number of different fronts. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1792.76s)]
*  So it is a reasonable inference. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1796.76s)]
*  Those who made it around Netanyahu, the prime minister himself, that Trump was going to be very good for Israel and had Israel's backing or provide Israel backing that President Trump didn't. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1799.12s)]
*  However, we are where we are today and nuclear talks are ongoing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1810.56s)]
*  Where do you see the Israeli opportunities, calculation and limitations? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1816.32s)]
*  So first, I have to say. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1822.12s)]
*  That. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1826.28s)]
*  Netanyahu, no, no doubt that Netanyahu was caught off guard in his last meeting with with Trump by the public statement that they're going to start nuclear talks. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1827.68s)]
*  And he knew that they were discussing it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1847.52s)]
*  He knew that it's going to happen. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1850.32s)]
*  But he didn't know that while he was sitting next to President Trump, there will be such an announcement in front of the cameras. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1853.12s)]
*  And. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1861.52s)]
*  I think when you add to that, what Trump said in that meeting about Syria and about Turkey, something that is, Netanyahu is highly concerned about Turkish involvement in Syria. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1863.84s)]
*  And basically, Trump said, yeah, Turkish involvement in Syria is great. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1875.24s)]
*  I support that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  And the fact that Trump did not commit to a military strike if talks fail and, you know, the fact that Trump. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1880.3600000000001s)]
*  Didn't say anything about lifting the tariff that back at the time he still planned to impose on Israel. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1897.0s)]
*  Not only that, he told Netanyahu, you're getting four billion a year. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1905.84s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1909.56s)]
*  Meaning like, you know, it would be good if you'd say thank you and shut up. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1910.88s)]
*  So that was a very bad meeting, a very bad meeting. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1918.04s)]
*  I mean, the number of people on both sides of the Atlantic that told me that they saw it as a humiliation of Netanyahu. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1921.6399999999999s)]
*  I think I heard it from 20 different people and from regardless of political affiliation, just people watched it and said, like, wow, this is humiliating. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1931.7199999999998s)]
*  So I think that Netanyahu is aware that he has very limited influence over White House decision making and over the president's policies. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1944.8s)]
*  It is true at the same time that on Gaza, at least, Trump seems to basically say, you know, whatever, you know, whatever you do, I'm OK. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1959.2s)]
*  But I think that's mainly because. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1971.32s)]
*  He doesn't it's not a priority for him, unlike, you know, Russia, Ukraine or Iran or terrorists, which is which are all, you know, very high priority for Trump. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1974.28s)]
*  And it means that once Gaza, for example, is is a priority again, then maybe there's not going to be this backing. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1987.28s)]
*  So I think Netanyahu knows he needs to navigate very carefully right now because. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=1996.96s)]
*  He can't eat, he has no ability to know what's coming, and. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2009.0400000000002s)]
*  I think especially after. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2015.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz is not national security security adviser anymore. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2018.56s)]
*  The channel between Ron Dermott and he was confident and Waltz was a key channel for a lot of things. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2021.52s)]
*  Iran was one issue, but Gaza also. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2030.1999999999998s)]
*  Gaza also and with Waltz gone, I think Netanyahu has even less ability to give an input into the, you know, his input into the decision making in the White House. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2032.96s)]
*  Right, I mean, that may be true, but of course, you know, it was Secretary Rubio, both the secretary of state and acting national security adviser, Secretary Hegsef. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2053.32s)]
*  And and other members of the administration who have very close relationships with their Israeli counterparts. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2063.44s)]
*  One can assume there's still be an opportunity for close discussions and not the kind of surprises that that Netanyahu and the Israelis experienced in 2013 and 2015. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2068.64s)]
*  During JPOA and JCPOA negotiations, and it may just also be that, to your point earlier, things are so preliminary in the talks that it's not yet the opportunity to start to influence. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2079.4s)]
*  But what I want to ask you, Barack. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2090.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'll give you by the way, I'll give you an example. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2091.44s)]
*  The US and Iran announced that they'll start technical talks, right? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2095.6s)]
*  The Israelis said in this in the last call between Netanyahu and Trump, and they said, oh, you're starting technical talks. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2100.8s)]
*  I want to send my experts to sit with your expert. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2107.92s)]
*  Trump said, great, send them. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2110.6s)]
*  So a team of Israeli nuclear experts came to Washington, D.C. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2112.88s)]
*  and to meet the US technical team. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2118.84s)]
*  And then they met one person, Michael Anton, who is heading the technical team, the head of policy planning in the State Department and, you know, a key [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2123.0s)]
*  a key player in many of the US diplomatic initiatives, both on Russia, Ukraine and Iran. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2133.84s)]
*  But at the time when they came to Washington, he was the only one that was still not a US team that can sit face to face and discuss this. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2140.28s)]
*  So this is just like one example of how this thing is really, really, really just starting. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2151.28s)]
*  Really early days. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2159.1600000000003s)]
*  But let's go back a bit into Israeli history, because I mean, Prime Minister Netanyahu has made the Iran issue his issue for decades. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2160.44s)]
*  I think it's fair to say his legacy depends on what he does, what he does about Iran. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2169.24s)]
*  And if Iran goes nuclear, there's no Israeli response. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2174.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's fair to say that that would be really damaging to the prime minister's legacy. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2177.96s)]
*  But it harkens back to two Israeli prime ministers who faced with similar situation, not identical, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2183.7200000000003s)]
*  defied two US presidents, two Republican presidents. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. Menachem Begin defied the wishes of the Reagan administration when he bombed the Al-Syriq reactor in 1981. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2196.04s)]
*  And the US response was was pretty harsh. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2204.88s)]
*  I mean, I remember I'm old enough to remember Vice President Bush blasting Israel for violating Iraq's territorial integrity. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2208.24s)]
*  I recall they imposed sanctions, including a partial military embargo on Israel at the time. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2216.3599999999997s)]
*  But Begin had the courage. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2223.12s)]
*  And years later, I think the Americans were grateful to Menachem Begin, particularly during the first Gulf War, when they had to confront Saddam. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  And Saddam didn't have nuclear weapons. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2235.08s)]
*  Fast forward to Prime Minister Olmert. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2237.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you remember this. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2241.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2242.52s)]
*  They provided evidence to the George W. Bush administration that Syria was building a nuclear reactor for nuclear weapons purposes. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2243.8799999999997s)]
*  They provided all the evidence. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2252.9199999999996s)]
*  And the response from the Bush administration was, we'll take care of it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2254.52s)]
*  We'll condemn them at the UN Security Council and we'll lead a public diplomatic effort to do this. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2259.08s)]
*  And Olmert said, thank you very much, Mr. President, turned around, went back to Israel and ordered the bombings of the Al-Kaibar reactor in Syria. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2264.36s)]
*  So two Israeli prime ministers defied two American presidents, both Republican, and went ahead and used the military option to destroy two nuclear weapons programs that were being built by two Israeli enemies. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  Why isn't Prime Minister Netanyahu going to be the third? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2286.6400000000003s)]
*  First, he might. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2290.4s)]
*  Although, you know, people don't change at the age of seventy five. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2292.4s)]
*  And if someone was prime minister for fifteen years and didn't do it, then it raises a lot of questions whether he will ever do it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2297.88s)]
*  But to his credit, it's also that Iraq and Syria, in most cases, it was like one facility. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2306.64s)]
*  You go in, you take it out and that's it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2315.6s)]
*  Iran is more complicated and, you know, many facilities underground. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2318.12s)]
*  But we also have to remember that now it's twenty twenty five when Menachem Begin did it in the 1980s. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2326.4s)]
*  Israel's military capabilities were also far less advanced than they are today. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2333.2s)]
*  Same goes for, you know, 2007 with Syria. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2339.64s)]
*  So it's a, you know, it's a complicated question on whether, you know, it's the same thing or it's much more complicated. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2344.64s)]
*  In any case, Netanyahu could have done it in twenty eleven, in twenty twelve, twenty thirteen. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2354.92s)]
*  He chose not to do it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2363.44s)]
*  OK, once he blamed Yuval Steinitz, who was his most loyal ally, his crony. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2365.2s)]
*  And, you know, you couldn't find a more, you know, a more loyal puppy than Yuval Steinitz to Netanyahu. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2379.4399999999996s)]
*  And Netanyahu blamed him that, you know, because he was against a strike in Iran at some point, it didn't happen. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2394.52s)]
*  OK, in twenty twelve or twenty thirteen, which is like ludicrous. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2402.9199999999996s)]
*  And by the way, Netanyahu. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2406.68s)]
*  Could have done it in the first Trump presidency. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2409.52s)]
*  He also didn't do it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2415.12s)]
*  He waited for, you know, for Trump to do it or for maximum pressure to to work. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2416.12s)]
*  He could have done it in November or December twenty twenty four. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2422.7999999999997s)]
*  Chose not to do it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2428.2799999999997s)]
*  So I'm not saying he wouldn't. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2430.52s)]
*  I'm just saying that there is a record that raises a lot of questions. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2434.64s)]
*  I would also say that we already know what Netanyahu's legacy on Iran is. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  Because we had October 7th, Hamas was funded, trained, armed by Iran, not by anybody else. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2450.36s)]
*  Netanyahu was the prime minister during all those years. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2461.96s)]
*  And that is Iran legacy. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2467.16s)]
*  October 7th is Netanyahu's Iran legacy. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2470.8s)]
*  Nothing else, you know. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2474.08s)]
*  The for now through October 7th through Hamas, Iran created. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  It wasn't an existential threat on Israel, obviously, but it was a huge threat. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2489.04s)]
*  OK, not threat. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2494.4s)]
*  It was something that materialized. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2495.56s)]
*  OK, so that's Netanyahu's legacy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2498.88s)]
*  And if you know, when the history books will be written, I don't know, 50 years from now, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2501.64s)]
*  100 years from now, five years from now, that's going to be his legacy. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2507.44s)]
*  OK, and. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2512.0s)]
*  Nothing he will do, even an attack on Iran, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2514.36s)]
*  OK, on the Iran nuclear program will not change that legacy. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2518.6s)]
*  So if he's looking to do it because of, you know, to like wipe out the stain of October 7th, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2523.24s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2532.32s)]
*  And by the way, that's not the reason for doing it. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2534.56s)]
*  I hope that's because that's a very cynical and political reason to do it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2538.48s)]
*  If you do it, you do it because of the merits and the merits are that Iran is very weak. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2545.6s)]
*  Its nuclear program is very advanced. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2552.92s)]
*  And you've been talking for 20 years or 30 years about removing this threat and you have an opportunity. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2555.64s)]
*  So I think this is the issue here. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2563.6s)]
*  If Netanyahu is thinking about his legacy, then, you know, then I have a problem with that [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2567.3199999999997s)]
*  because it's it's not it's not that this is not the reason. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2573.4799999999996s)]
*  But let's agree. Let's agree. You're right that it's not about legacy, but it's about the security. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2578.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Of the state of Israel. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2582.7999999999997s)]
*  It's also about American national security. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2584.2s)]
*  It's about ensuring that the leading state sponsor terrorism that has killed and maimed thousands of [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2585.9199999999996s)]
*  Americans, thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of Middle Easterners doesn't end up with nuclear [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2590.6s)]
*  tip missiles. Yeah. But that he knew that in 2011, 2012, 2013. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2595.64s)]
*  To be fair, to be fair, Barack. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2601.24s)]
*  I mean, I've heard this argument before and I've been working this issue for over 20 years and others have been working this for much longer. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2602.64s)]
*  It would have been a fair assumption to have said 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2612.24s)]
*  that Iran would already have a nuclear weapon. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2618.72s)]
*  And there's a reason Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2620.92s)]
*  Some would say they don't have a nuclear weapon because Khamenei has not yet made the decision to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2623.44s)]
*  Some would say, well, in fact, they had an active nuclear weapons program, certainly before 2003. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2628.0s)]
*  That program changed in its nature after 2003 because of the U.S. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2638.04s)]
*  invasion of Iraq and the concern that in Iran that they were next. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2643.2799999999997s)]
*  But they never stopped their nuclear weapons program. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2647.7200000000003s)]
*  They just put part of it in the in a covert manner and part of it in an overt manner. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2649.88s)]
*  But they continued their nuclear weapons program. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2658.28s)]
*  And yet, because of a combination of Israeli sabotage efforts, economic pressure, U.S. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2660.4s)]
*  diplomacy, Iran today in 2025 still doesn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2670.1600000000003s)]
*  So I think you could say that this has been successful. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2675.3999999999996s)]
*  It's been a successful strategy for the past 20 years. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2680.0s)]
*  But but we are at the moment. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2683.24s)]
*  But that's not BB's strategy. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2685.04s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2686.92s)]
*  The strategy you're describing is not Netanyahu's strategy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2689.08s)]
*  It's a strategy that started with Ariel Sharon giving the order to make the gun, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2694.8799999999997s)]
*  OK, to, you know, start covert operations against the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2700.64s)]
*  It continued with Edward Olmert, you know, doing the same thing, you know, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2706.24s)]
*  telling the Mossad to do sabotage operations, cyber attacks, Olympic Games. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2712.6s)]
*  OK, the cyber attack against the Iranian centrifuges is something that it happened [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2720.16s)]
*  when Netanyahu was already prime minister in after he won the election in 2009. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2727.2s)]
*  But it started when Olmert was the prime minister. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2732.96s)]
*  So the the whole, you know, effort to contain or to or to slow down or to delay [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2736.44s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it, the Iranian nuclear program, something that started [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2745.52s)]
*  with with Ariel Sharon continued with Edward Olmert and continued Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2749.96s)]
*  And with Bennett and with and with Bennett and Lapid, the difference is that Netanyahu, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2755.3599999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu is the only one from those leaders who said again and again and again [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2760.7999999999997s)]
*  that he will destroy Iran's nuclear program. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  And so that's why him claiming that, you know, we did sanctions, we did sabotage, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2772.8399999999997s)]
*  we did that's all great. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2779.08s)]
*  OK, but that wasn't your strategy. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2781.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, to be fair, I mean, again, I want to be fair here because I think it's always [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2784.36s)]
*  important to try to be nonpartisan in these discussions. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2787.6400000000003s)]
*  I certainly try on the US side as much as possible that the strategy of all of these [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2790.6800000000003s)]
*  prime ministers is to prevent Iran from developing. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2795.84s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2797.88s)]
*  And all these prime ministers, there's more continuity than difference. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2798.8s)]
*  All of them used a variety of tools of Israeli power to do so. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2804.52s)]
*  All of them had relationships with US presidents, some very close, some very contentious. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2809.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there's I think there's continuity in Israeli strategy [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2817.6400000000003s)]
*  not to just quote destroy Iran's nuclear program, but to stop Iran from developing [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2821.7200000000003s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. And most importantly, I think all these Israeli prime ministers [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2825.8s)]
*  understood back to the beginning of our conversation that if you're going to prevent [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2828.6800000000003s)]
*  Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, you cannot give Iran the nuclear infrastructure. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2833.7200000000003s)]
*  You cannot give them the fissile material and you can't give them the domestic [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2837.8s)]
*  enrichment and reprocessing capability to develop that nuclear weapon. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2840.68s)]
*  I mean, there's been a lot of consistency on Iran's strategy over decades, at least [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2844.2s)]
*  from my perspective as a non-Israeli outsider. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2848.84s)]
*  I think there's been more continuity and more agreement amongst Israeli leaders than [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2852.44s)]
*  amongst American leaders. I think our Iran policy, there's been radical differences [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2857.16s)]
*  between prime ministers and I mean, between presidents and the United States. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2863.4s)]
*  I think you would agree with that. I mean, Obama to Trump is a sharp break in US [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2867.4s)]
*  strategy. And it's also an issue that I think has become unfortunately very partisan and [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2873.56s)]
*  very polarizing in the United States. I think maybe more so than in Israel. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2878.76s)]
*  You prepared a comment on that in terms of the Israeli public, the Israeli view of this? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2883.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, look, I just, you know, obviously, it's very political, okay, also in Israel, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2887.24s)]
*  but I'm just saying that when Aftali Bennett became the prime minister after [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2894.7599999999998s)]
*  13 years of Netanyahu, something like that, and, you know, with the government with Lapid [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2903.08s)]
*  and with Gantz and one of the things that Bennett, Lapid and Gantz all agreed on is that [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2910.36s)]
*  doing the Trump, the first Trump term when Israel had its consecutive ongoing election campaigns, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2921.2400000000002s)]
*  um, Netanyahu completely neglected for political reasons, for political reasons, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2933.56s)]
*  because one of the issues was the, you need to pass a budget. Okay. And he refused to pass a budget, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2940.76s)]
*  which is sort of crazy. And because of that, there was a huge gap in preparedness for of the IDF [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2947.7200000000003s)]
*  scenario of a military strike in Iran. Right. Certain programs were either shut down or [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2958.84s)]
*  suspended and we're not getting fully funded. It's a fact. Though to be fair, and I just want to [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2964.0400000000004s)]
*  sort of be fair in these discussions is, I mean, part of the reason, apart from the multiple [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2968.76s)]
*  elections and not passing a budget was also that at the time, Gaddi Aizenkot as then IDF chief of [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2975.0s)]
*  staff recommended to Netanyahu after JCPOA was reached that the IDF's priorities in terms of [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2981.48s)]
*  resource allocation should shift from Iran nuclear to countering Hezbollah. And in fact, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2989.88s)]
*  many of the programs and capabilities that we've seen now exercised over the past year and a half [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=2995.08s)]
*  against Hezbollah, perhaps at the time, programs were started and budgeted as a result of Aizenkot's [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3001.08s)]
*  recommendation to Netanyahu, which was a perfectly reasonable recommendation. We have JCPOA. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3008.76s)]
*  This thing is going to be deferred for a number of years because of the agreement. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3014.36s)]
*  The restrictions are going to sunset, but not immediately. The IDF needs to start spending [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3018.28s)]
*  money, time and resources on countering Hezbollah and developing capabilities against Hezbollah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3023.4s)]
*  Would you agree with that as part of the reason? It's part of the reason. The only thing is that [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3029.0s)]
*  that was when the Obama was still the president, but then Trump came in and Netanyahu pushed Trump [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3034.04s)]
*  to withdraw from the JCPOA, which he did. So, and by the way, Aizenkot at the time was against [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3042.3599999999997s)]
*  the US withdrawing from the JCPOA and Netanyahu was in favor. So if you are in favor and before [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3050.4399999999996s)]
*  your policy was okay, there's just a POA. Let's focus on other things. Once there's no JCPOA [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3062.12s)]
*  and you have Donald Trump in the White House, you would think that this means that, okay, so we need [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3068.8399999999997s)]
*  to review again the policy and at least know that we have, you know, a capability which is ready [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3075.7999999999997s)]
*  because at the time, you know, there were, there was the, you know, the American drone that was [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3085.56s)]
*  shot down by Iran and it was a point that people thought maybe something's going to happen. Then [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3094.92s)]
*  Trump decided not to do anything. Then there was the Iranian attack on the oil facilities in Saudi [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3100.2000000000003s)]
*  Arabia. This was also a point people thought maybe it will change something and we need to be ready. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3106.2000000000003s)]
*  Then there was the Soleimani assassination that also, so you had like several points of like that, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3112.92s)]
*  you know, were like, you know, sort of like an alarms that go off and say, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3121.32s)]
*  we need to have this ready because you don't know where this thing is going. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3126.6s)]
*  Or Barack, to be fair, I mean, again, just be fair, the opposite and this may be, you know, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3129.8s)]
*  getting back to today, which I think is where we need to end on is if your assumption is, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3134.04s)]
*  I now have President Trump back in the White House. President Trump is withdrawn from the deal and [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3140.6s)]
*  he's committed to maximum pressure. The United States has made stopping an Iranian nuclear weapon [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3145.16s)]
*  their priority. The United States is going to take care of this problem instead of subcontracting to [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3151.0s)]
*  Israel, a tiny country of 10 million people with a highly effective but very small air force and [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3156.3599999999997s)]
*  intelligence community. Now the United States is on this issue and we don't need to be preparing [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3161.7999999999997s)]
*  for an Israeli military attack on our own. The United States will take care of it. That was first [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3169.0s)]
*  Trump administration. Second Trump administration is I don't need to go on to Joe Biden during the [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3173.8s)]
*  transition because Donald Trump's coming to the White House, the same Donald Trump who led the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3178.6s)]
*  same maximum pressure campaign back in his first term, who has made stopping Iran's nuclear weapon [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3183.08s)]
*  a key part of his agenda and his legacy. And so the United States is there and the United States [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3190.12s)]
*  is back so we don't have to prepare. It seems to me that in both cases Netanyahu has been counting [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3195.56s)]
*  on President Trump to stop this. Would you say that he made the right decision or that he made [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3202.36s)]
*  a mistake? We don't know yet. No, we have a track record. Look, I'm not the one. Can I just say, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3208.12s)]
*  did he make the right decision back in first term Trump? Because we don't know his second term [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3216.04s)]
*  Trump. First, I'm no, I'm talking first term Trump. Yeah. Transition and now. So there's a [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3220.76s)]
*  track record. And what all I'm saying is, I'm not making an opinion about whether Israel should [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3229.48s)]
*  attack Iran or not. Okay. I'm just saying this. There's a guy who was prime minister for 15 years [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3236.6800000000003s)]
*  said again and again and again and gave orders. He didn't just say it in public and then in [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3246.1200000000003s)]
*  private. He gave orders, you know, to to to prepare for a military strike in Iran, then did [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3250.68s)]
*  not give the order. And then all of a sudden decided that that's it. We don't need to prepare [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3256.3599999999997s)]
*  anymore. And there was like a three year period where he did nothing on this issue. And for [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3262.2s)]
*  totally domestic political reasons of political survival. But the IDF was preparing against [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3271.0s)]
*  Hezbollah. I mean, you have to you have to acknowledge that. Yes. But since when is this [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3275.08s)]
*  like, you know, either or that's it was it was never either or. No, that's fair. It's not either [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3279.4s)]
*  or though. I mean, unfortunately, life is either or in terms of priorities and budgets and a lot [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3285.88s)]
*  of that. But a lot of the resources that Israel used at the end, like the weapons themselves that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3290.6s)]
*  Israel used to kill Nasrallah are the same kind of weapons that it would have used to attack [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3299.48s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities. So it's there's an overlap. Yeah. OK. So again, I'm not the one [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3308.36s)]
*  who said for years Israel will defend itself by itself, will not be dependent on anybody else, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3316.6s)]
*  will not allow another Holocaust. I'm not the one who said all those things. And I just think [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3323.96s)]
*  that, you know, if a politician says those things for decades, I mean, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3330.36s)]
*  it just needs to be like, you know, a minimum accountability and not just say, oh, but, you know, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3336.92s)]
*  you see how much I managed to impose sanctions to get the U.S. to impose sanctions on Iran. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3343.88s)]
*  That's great. Thank you. Thank you for your work. But that's not what you promised. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3349.56s)]
*  Well, it is fair to say, and I really want to just get this as sort of a closing insight, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3355.4s)]
*  it is fair to say whether it was by design, by accident, whether it was by strategy or tragedy. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3359.88s)]
*  Israel today is in a much stronger position vis-a-vis Iran and its access of misery or access [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3367.08s)]
*  of resistance, as the Iranians call it, than really it ever been. Iran is weaker than it's [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3372.36s)]
*  been since the Iran-Iraq war. Its core capabilities have been severely degraded, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3377.0s)]
*  in some cases destroyed. And we haven't even talked about the other element of [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3382.92s)]
*  strategy that I think is really important, which is to provide maximum support to the Iranian [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3387.08s)]
*  people who have been on the streets since 2009, yelling death to the dictator and asking every [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3392.12s)]
*  U.S. president, are you with us or are you with the dictator? And have gotten no support from any [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3396.84s)]
*  U.S. administration. And arguably until recently, they haven't gotten any support from any Israeli [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3402.92s)]
*  government. I am pleased to see that in the past year or so that Israel has now made maximum [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3407.8s)]
*  support for the Iranian people, a key pillar of its Iran strategy. I think it would have been great [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3414.2000000000003s)]
*  if this had been started 10, 15 years ago, not just after October 7th. But this is going to be [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3420.52s)]
*  a key element going forward, regardless of what happens on the nuclear torques. And it's been a [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3425.88s)]
*  consistent theme of this podcast, which is you got to prepare for weakening and undermining [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3429.64s)]
*  and supporting, weakening and undermining the regime and supporting the Iranian people [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3435.56s)]
*  to hopefully one day replace this regime with something with a regime that is much more [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3439.56s)]
*  responsible and is not threatening Israel or United States or its neighbors. Are you looking [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3444.2s)]
*  forward, are you hopeful that we've turned the corner on some of the mistakes of the past or [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3451.16s)]
*  are you worried that we're about to hit the wall on Iran policy in a way that will be devastating [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3457.48s)]
*  for U.S. and Israeli security? Look, I think two things. First, I think that, let's say there's [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3464.04s)]
*  going to be a deal. Okay, let's go with this scenario for a moment. I think there's immense [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3476.6s)]
*  huge potential to get a deal that is, you know, how Blinken used to call it longer, stronger, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3484.84s)]
*  broader. All the elements are there. But longer, stronger, broader is still JCPOA. Just understand [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3494.6800000000003s)]
*  that. No, again, it still has enrichment. Again, my personal opinion is that, again, I said it, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3501.7200000000003s)]
*  the only way to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, to blow it up, is through military force. I do [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3512.76s)]
*  not see how you do that in a deal. If you want to get a deal, okay, and which Trump says he does, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3520.1200000000003s)]
*  he has the opportunity to make it broader, stronger, longer, like a lot of potential to do it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3529.32s)]
*  All the elements are there. And the question is, how tough is ready to be in order to, you know, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3538.6s)]
*  to tell the Iranians, you will get a deal, and you will get something in return, but you will [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3550.04s)]
*  have to give a lot. I mean, to the point of almost everything, because, again, I don't think that in [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3557.72s)]
*  a deal they will agree to give everything, meaning dismantle their nuclear program. But I think he [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3565.96s)]
*  can get with them to a deal that they agree to give up almost everything, which, again, each of [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3570.92s)]
*  our listeners will agree if he thinks it's good or bad, I'm not, you know, giving my personal opinion. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3579.96s)]
*  So that's one thing. There's huge potential to do it. At the same time, there's still also [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3585.4s)]
*  a big opportunity, okay, and again, I'm not expressing an opinion, I'm describing reality. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3592.36s)]
*  There's still a huge window of opportunity for a military strike against Iran, because Iran is still [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3600.92s)]
*  weak. It still doesn't have its proxies back. It still doesn't have its full missile arsenal back. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3612.36s)]
*  It still doesn't have its air defenses back. And the US has, I think, the biggest military buildup [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3619.56s)]
*  in the region, I think, at least since the first two months of after October 7th, maybe even more, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3631.96s)]
*  because they didn't have B-2 bombers in the region at the time. So, huge buildup. So, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3641.24s)]
*  so I think if you're someone who supports military action, if you're somebody who supports [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3647.96s)]
*  a deal, for both of those points of view, the stars are aligned, okay? And now the question is, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3656.12s)]
*  what kind of decisions the leaders are going to make? It's now in the realm of the decision [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3667.96s)]
*  makers. That's where we are right now. The conditions are perfect for both options. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3676.6000000000004s)]
*  And Trump will have to decide. It's literally, I think, one person who decides. It's not even two, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3685.5600000000004s)]
*  meaning it's not even Trump and the Supreme Leader. I really think it's all on Donald Trump. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3695.4s)]
*  He can get, I think, a deal that is, again, for those who support a deal, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3702.28s)]
*  that achieves almost 100%, I don't know, 95%. And for those who support a military strike, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3712.84s)]
*  can definitely go on a military strike in conditions that are, you know, you can never [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3723.2400000000002s)]
*  know. You know how you start a military strike. You don't know how you end it. But [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3731.32s)]
*  at least the conditions right now are, you know, operationally and regionally are, you know, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3736.6800000000003s)]
*  the best, I think, you'll ever get. That's if I look at the reality on the ground. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3745.96s)]
*  HOFFMAN RUCK Thank you. We're going to continue to really depend on your reporting [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3753.88s)]

*  HOFFMAN RUCK That was Barack Ravid, laying bare the high-stakes chess match of the [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3782.92s)]
*  Iran nuclear talks. From Oman's back rooms to Capitol Hill, the Supreme Leader's office in [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3786.92s)]
*  Tehran, the White House, and the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, every move now risks either [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3792.52s)]
*  locking down Iran's program or unleashing it. For U.S. and ally policymakers, the clock is ticking. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3797.96s)]
*  Time is running out. I'm Marc Dubowitz and this has been the Iran Breakdown. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzqzAWHuEU&t=3803.8s)]
