In his first live interview since his release from ICE detention, Columbia University student and Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi recounts the traumatic experience of his arrest and incarceration. Mahdawi, a green card holder who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, was arrested in Vermont on April 14 when he appeared for what he was told would be a citizenship interview, and spent more than two weeks in U.S. immigration custody, where he was held in retaliation for his speech in support of Palestinian rights. Mahdawi's detention has led him to reflect on the "interconnectedness between injustices," as multiple members of his family in Palestine have been "unjustly" incarcerated in Israeli jails. "Now I can feel their pain," says Mahdawi. Despite the U.S. government and pro-Israel groups' attempts to silence his calls for an end to genocide in Gaza, he adds, "I share my pain with the world."

*  Well, Mohsen Madawi joins me here now in our New York studio for his first live interview. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=191.82s)]
*  Welcome to Democracy Now! [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=198.5s)]
*  Congratulations on your freedom, Mohsen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=200.06s)]
*  Thank you, Amy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  And good morning to your audience as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=205.5s)]
*  So if you can start off by telling us what happened, why you ended up going back to Vermont [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=208.3s)]
*  for this final, what you thought, immigration interview. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was waiting for this interview, which is my naturalization process to receive [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=222.54s)]
*  a citizenship for over a year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=229.66s)]
*  And the reason I had to go to Vermont, because my residence, my permanent residence is in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=234.66s)]
*  Vermont. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=239.98s)]
*  Therefore, I went to basically what I thought should be a normal, you know, naturalization [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=241.54s)]
*  interview. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  I expected at the same time that there might be a trap set up for me just seeing and witnessing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  what happened to other students, including Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=259.98s)]
*  And therefore, I was prepared for that interview, that I might come on the other side with full [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=265.82s)]
*  rights or no rights. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=270.62s)]
*  We interviewed Vermont Congressmember Becca Ballant at the time, because you had written [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=272.82s)]
*  to her—she's the sole congressmember in Vermont—as well as to Senators Peter Welch, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=279.38s)]
*  who visited you in prison, and Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  You wrote them all because you were so concerned about what would happen? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=287.9s)]
*  This is exactly right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I prepared for many different—on many different levels. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  Part of why I stayed in Vermont is because of the support that I received from official [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=297.82s)]
*  representatives such as the senators and the congresswomen, who I'm very grateful for. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=303.82s)]
*  But at the same time, also, I had to arrange with my lawyers in order to have everything [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=309.34s)]
*  drafted, ready to go, just prepared for the worst-case scenario. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  So I prepared with the lawyers, contacted my representatives and contacted my community [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=323.38s)]
*  members who are very close to me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  And we saw the aftermath of this is I was able to stay in Vermont, something that other [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  students did not have the luxury to do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=335.26000000000005s)]
*  They were uprooted from their communities and from legal support. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=338.06s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  You go to the naturalization interview. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  What day was that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=344.66s)]
*  It was on the 14th of April. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=346.5s)]
*  And you went with your lawyer? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  I went with one of my lawyers, an immigration lawyer. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=351.42s)]
*  We go into USCIS office. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=355.46s)]
*  This is the immigration office where I'm supposed to have my interview. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=358.3s)]
*  And everything looked kind of normal. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=362.74s)]
*  There were some signs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=365.42s)]
*  The officer who interviewed me inside was waiting for us. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=367.62s)]
*  And after being in the lobby for a few minutes, the lobby was emptied from any other applicants. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=372.06s)]
*  So it was only myself, my lawyer and my friend. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=379.78s)]
*  And they looked at them and they said, this is the calm before the storm. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=384.05999999999995s)]
*  And so you had your interview? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=388.78s)]
*  Did you sign any documents? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=392.38s)]
*  I went through my regular interview for citizenship to the point I thought that I am going to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=393.38s)]
*  receive the citizenship that same day because I was asked the questions that I had to answer. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=399.5s)]
*  I answered the questions correctly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=406.74s)]
*  And then I was asked if I am willing to take the pledge of allegiance. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=409.54s)]
*  When the officer asked me if I am willing to do so, I said, of course. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=414.18s)]
*  And he asked me to sign a document saying that I am willing to actually protect and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=418.7s)]
*  defend the constitution of this country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=423.74s)]
*  And shortly after that moment, just within a minute, the DHS agents storm the office, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=427.22s)]
*  separate me from my lawyer, and they say that I am under arrest. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=435.90000000000003s)]
*  Masked? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean— [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  Were they masked? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  They were masked. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  They had hoods on. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=444.58000000000004s)]
*  You could not recognize them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  And they had guns on them as well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  And they masked around you? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=453.42s)]
*  Did they handcuff you? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=454.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  Directly, actually, there was not any space or room to show us documents or to explain [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  anything. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=462.98s)]
*  And they said, you're under arrest. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=464.1s)]
*  So I gave them my hands and I said, I am a peaceful man. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  I am not going to resist. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=469.3s)]
*  And so you were taken. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  Where was your lawyer? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=474.74s)]
*  They prevented my lawyer from being with me. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  So I was taken through the back door into the lobby, outside of that building, into [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=479.62s)]
*  an unmarked SUV. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=486.66s)]
*  And my lawyer did not know what's happening with me. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=489.48s)]
*  In fact, at that time, all of what was going in their head is to basically execute the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=492.34s)]
*  premeditated plan that they had in mind, which is to ship me, to send me to Louisiana. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=500.26s)]
*  They had the tickets, the airplane tickets printed— [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  The agents. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=509.82s)]
*  The agents had the tickets ready. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=510.82s)]
*  So they drove you to Burlington? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  The airport? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=515.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=516.54s)]
*  Before they took me to the airport, they took me to a building to process me. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=518.02s)]
*  And the processing, which we expected to take place in St. Albans, at the prison, did not [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=522.38s)]
*  actually take place there. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=528.3s)]
*  So I was surprised, very surprised. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=530.06s)]
*  They processed me in a different building, separate building, only 10 minutes away from [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=533.12s)]
*  the airport. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=537.18s)]
*  And then they drive me to the airport and they hand me to two other agents who are supposed [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=538.62s)]
*  to fly me on a commercial flight. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  At that moment, I asked the agents, I said, are we going to Louisiana? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=549.22s)]
*  And they said yes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=554.8s)]
*  And I asked which direction, so I clarified that it's going to stop by New York City, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=556.42s)]
*  then to Louisiana. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=561.3399999999999s)]
*  We went into the airport and we realized that the flight was—basically, we were late. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  The flight was about to take off. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=571.14s)]
*  The airplane was being taxied. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=573.78s)]
*  During that time, I also was not feeling well, so I had to use the restroom for a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=576.74s)]
*  brief time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=581.58s)]
*  And the moment I get out of the restroom, while we're walking towards the gate, we [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=583.14s)]
*  see the airplane being taxied away. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=587.54s)]
*  So your stop in the bathroom saved you from this plane? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=591.58s)]
*  I don't know if that is the reason, but some people think that this might be the reason. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=595.98s)]
*  When you got to the airport, you saw the plane—when you got to the gate, you saw the plane pulling [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=601.54s)]
*  away. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=606.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=607.62s)]
*  And what did it allow time for, for your lawyer? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=608.62s)]
*  I mean, if you think of it, that has changed the path of my legal fight for justice. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=611.94s)]
*  It allowed my lawyers to fight on fair ground and to free me within 16 days, something that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  other students, as you saw, weeks and months they've been in detention. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=630.5s)]
*  So you were held in detention in a prison in Vermont? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=636.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=641.34s)]
*  With other migrants? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=642.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=644.78s)]
*  In this prison, in fact, basically I rent a section of the prison, and the section where [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=647.42s)]
*  I was, it was a mixture of three-quarters of people who have committed the crimes before [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=654.9s)]
*  and one-quarter of migrants who come in and out. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=660.86s)]
*  And I was, my cell was C38, the first cell in that C section where the migrants are. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=665.5s)]
*  So I saw waves of the migrants. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=673.5799999999999s)]
*  Those are not just migrants, those are the people who feed us, who plant our food, who [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=676.92s)]
*  harvest our organic, delicious Vermont produce. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=682.18s)]
*  Like the dairy workers? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=686.18s)]
*  And the dairy workers as well. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=687.18s)]
*  So I was able to meet the first wave, which is farm workers who worked on farms, and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=688.94s)]
*  the second wave was farm workers who worked on the dairy, sorry, in dairy farms. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=696.3000000000001s)]
*  Describe the conditions of your detention and what that brought to you, what that reminded [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=702.86s)]
*  you of. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  Fabric is of injustice. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=715.3800000000001s)]
*  You see them everywhere. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=716.82s)]
*  I was prepared for a worst-case scenario. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=719.46s)]
*  So to be honest with you, being in this prison was not as bad as I thought mentally. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=721.46s)]
*  But the difficult parts was realizing this interconnectedness between injustices. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=730.7s)]
*  It reminded me of my uncles, and specifically my uncle Abed, at some point when a guard [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  the light through the squared window in the door, and the light was so strong in my eyes, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=745.4200000000001s)]
*  and they remembered my uncle who had bloody eyes permanently. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=751.34s)]
*  And then I thought... [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=755.82s)]
*  Where was your uncle? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=756.82s)]
*  My uncle was imprisoned in the Israeli prisons, and now he's no longer alive. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=757.82s)]
*  He was in the West Bank. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  He passed away two years ago. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  He was born, raised, and died in a refugee camp, the same refugee camp where I was born. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=767.0600000000001s)]
*  Al-Farah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=772.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=773.78s)]
*  And I had this realization when I was there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=774.98s)]
*  I am now interconnected to three generations of my family. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=777.62s)]
*  My grandfather, who was unjustly imprisoned, my father and my uncles, who were unjustly [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=782.14s)]
*  imprisoned, and my cousins, who were also unjustly imprisoned. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  And now I can feel their pain. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=790.74s)]
*  You also lost your brother, as well as other members of your family. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=793.9s)]
*  Talk about where you were born. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=797.98s)]
*  Talk about your family in the West Bank and in Gaza. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=800.22s)]
*  What I am doing here in America, this is exactly the question that I hope for the government [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=804.7800000000001s)]
*  to ask and to look into, rather than just labeling me. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  What I've been protesting for is related to my firsthand life experience. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  As a child, I buried my own brother when I was eight years old. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=823.62s)]
*  He was six years old. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  And my brother faced serious issues. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=830.82s)]
*  He was paralyzed because the Israeli army prevented my father from taking him to receive [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=833.14s)]
*  medical care. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=840.3s)]
*  The camp was under siege. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=841.3s)]
*  And then in the second Intifada, when it started in 2000, I was 10 years old. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=844.22s)]
*  And I witnessed my best friend getting shot and killed in front of my eyes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=851.02s)]
*  The pain of injustice that you feel when you see just a kid who you loved so much, his [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=858.66s)]
*  life being taken away in a second, is a painful experience. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=865.82s)]
*  But that wasn't it, too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=870.42s)]
*  My uncle, on September 12, 2001, after September 11, my uncle Thayer was killed on the hands [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=871.82s)]
*  of the Israeli army as well. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=880.26s)]
*  Where? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=882.18s)]
*  In Tammon, in fact, between Al-Far'a refugee camp and Tammon, the same town that five people [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=883.2199999999999s)]
*  were killed, it's only five miles away, actually five kilometers away, about three [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=893.26s)]
*  miles away from the refugee camp. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=898.6999999999999s)]
*  The five people were just killed in the last day. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=900.5799999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  So it hits home. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  Everything that I am seeing and I am witnessing, I mean, in the second Intifada also, I lost [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=905.54s)]
*  two cousins. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=910.18s)]
*  I was shot in my leg when I was 15 years old. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=911.42s)]
*  And some people would say, oh, what was happening and why those people were killed? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=915.78s)]
*  This does not what matters is that children live in pain, in suffering, in trauma. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=920.38s)]
*  And we have to see that for what it is. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=927.82s)]
*  And we cannot justify the killing, the murder, the continuous occupation, the apartheid, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=930.66s)]
*  the genocide. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=938.02s)]
*  We cannot justify it anymore. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=939.16s)]
*  We either have to be pro-peace or pro-war. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=941.64s)]
*  There is no third option. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=947.0s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  So many people are suffering. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=950.5799999999999s)]
*  And for me, many family members in the West Bank since October 7, four cousins. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=952.04s)]
*  In Gaza, more than 30 of my extended family. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=958.64s)]
*  And I come here to Colombia. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=963.0s)]
*  And what I do, I share my pain with the world. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=964.56s)]
*  And I say, this is so painful. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=969.9599999999999s)]
*  The war must stop. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=972.26s)]
*  Children are suffering. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  The trauma is unbearable. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=975.88s)]
*  And what they do, the American government and the extreme groups, the pro-Israel extreme [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=978.64s)]
*  groups, they want to silence me. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  They don't want me to grieve. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=986.8199999999999s)]
*  They don't want me to share the pain. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=988.68s)]
*  They don't want me to share the loss. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  They don't want me to ask for justice. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=993.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter if I'm doing it in the most peaceful, nonviolent way or not. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=995.0999999999999s)]
*  They want to silence me. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1000.62s)]
*  You were president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association for two years. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1003.02s)]
*  What made you become a Buddhist? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1009.14s)]
*  I discovered Buddhism when I came to America. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1012.26s)]
*  And what made me become Buddhist is the practice of meditation and empathy that helped me with [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1017.26s)]
*  my pain and the trauma that I bear as a child. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1026.02s)]
*  So when I came to America for the first time in my life, I was provided with a level of [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1029.82s)]
*  safety to feel safe. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1034.46s)]
*  And when you have that level of physical and emotional safety, the trauma starts surfacing. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1037.14s)]
*  And Buddhism has helped me to center, to calm my emotions and to be able to connect [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1043.62s)]
*  with the other, even my oppressors, even people who cause me harm. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1051.4199999999998s)]
*  And this is how I started my journey and dived deeper into Buddhism until I led the Buddhist [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1056.54s)]
*  Association at Columbia. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1062.8999999999999s)]
*  Over these last few months, the protests that have taken place across the country, calling [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1065.78s)]
*  for the release of the detained students like yourself, have been massive. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1072.22s)]
*  And on April 20th, protesters gathered at Union Square to call for your release. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1080.74s)]
*  The protest was organized by Israelis for Peace. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1087.3000000000002s)]
*  This is Josh Drill, an Israeli-American master's student at Columbia University. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1092.22s)]
*  To deport someone like Mokhsen sends a chilling message that peace builders are not welcome [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1098.26s)]
*  here. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1104.3s)]
*  It derails the very path we so desperately need, and it actively stops Israelis and Palestinians [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1105.78s)]
*  from meeting. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1112.02s)]
*  As a peace collective, we cannot allow this to happen. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1113.02s)]
*  We cannot allow these deportations to happen. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1117.98s)]
*  They threaten our future. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1121.54s)]
*  At that protest, I also spoke to the New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is running [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1124.62s)]
*  for mayor right now. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1130.98s)]
*  This is somebody who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank, saw a friend be killed [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1131.98s)]
*  by an Israeli soldier, and yet, rather than turn to vengeance and pick up a rock or a [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1137.9399999999998s)]
*  gun, turned to Buddhism and becomes a peace activist and comes here and goes into Sindag [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1143.02s)]
*  speaking about empathy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1148.5s)]
*  The New York City Comptroller running for mayor, Brad Lander, also Zoran Mandani, who's [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1151.74s)]
*  running for mayor, has come out in support of you. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1158.3000000000002s)]
*  How did you experience that in prison? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1159.3000000000002s)]
*  It might be too cheesy to say that I have never felt as much love and support as much [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1164.0600000000002s)]
*  as I felt when I was in the cell. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1172.6200000000001s)]
*  I was not able to see the full spectrum of support and of love and of protests, but I [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1176.26s)]
*  heard about some of the action that was taking place. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1185.02s)]
*  And I have to say I was deeply moved by seeing everybody who has mobilized and protested, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1188.6200000000001s)]
*  but more specifically by the Israeli and Jewish community in New York City and in America [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1196.14s)]
*  really like moving and raising their voices against my detention. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1204.2s)]
*  Also, Judge Crawford noted his court had received more than 90 statements and letters. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1208.96s)]
*  I understand now it's well over 100, from Vermont community members, academic experts [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1215.04s)]
*  and professors, many of them Jewish, vouching for your character. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1221.04s)]
*  What did that mean to you, Mohsen? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1226.64s)]
*  It meant that I am heard, that I am being seen, that my advocacy and work for peace [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1228.92s)]
*  and for justice did not go for nothing. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1237.24s)]
*  All of this is the Trump administration. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  One after you, saying you promoted anti-Semitism, what did Secretary of State Marco Rubio claim [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1245.64s)]
*  that the New York Times obtained that your actions could, quote, potentially undermine [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1254.72s)]
*  the Middle East peace process? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1260.04s)]
*  Your response? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1262.76s)]
*  I'm not sure if they actually have a peace process. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1263.76s)]
*  If they have a peace process, let them show us what the plan is. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1266.92s)]
*  What we are doing is we are protesting and we are standing against war. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1272.08s)]
*  We're asking for America and for the rest of the world to abide by international law [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1277.16s)]
*  and human rights as a first step. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1283.88s)]
*  This government has been violating the basic principles of human rights and the basic principles [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1287.0800000000002s)]
*  that international law was established on. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
*  They're violating this country's own laws, the Leahy laws. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1299.0800000000002s)]
*  And if they are accusing me— [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  The former senator of Vermont. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1304.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1307.36s)]
*  And what they are doing, they are gaslighting the American people, and they are pointing [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1308.36s)]
*  the wrong direction. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1314.96s)]
*  My response to this is listen to the peacemakers who we have—Palestinians, Israelis, Jews, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1318.08s)]
*  Muslims, Americans, everyone—and see the fact and the reality for what it is. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1325.44s)]
*  What they're trying to do, they're trying to distract from the real issue, and the real [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1332.12s)]
*  issue is funding and supporting a genocide and dehumanizing Palestinians and seeing them [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1336.04s)]
*  as less of a value, don't deserve equal rights as everybody else. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1343.4s)]
*  Mohsen Madawi, can you talk about your dreams for the future, starting with next week? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1349.12s)]
*  Class day is Monday. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1356.8s)]
*  I don't know if it was time for the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X's birthday, but [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1358.04s)]
*  that is Monday, May 19th. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1362.72s)]
*  Graduation is Wednesday. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1364.68s)]
*  What does it mean for you to be here in New York, graduating with your classmates? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  This is a long-waited-for journey. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1373.88s)]
*  This is the seed of hope that my uncle Thayer has planted in me when I was 11 years old [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1377.44s)]
*  and when I was in deep level of pain after the loss and horror and the trauma that I [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1384.2s)]
*  felt. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1391.3600000000001s)]
*  And he said to me, he said, after the Nakba, the 1948, we lost everything but our minds [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1392.6s)]
*  and our souls. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1401.6s)]
*  And he said, education and hope is your only way and your path moving forward, because [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1402.6s)]
*  we have nothing left. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1408.9599999999998s)]
*  And in honor of my uncle's spirit, I continued studying really hard until I made it to this [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1411.08s)]
*  point, despite of all of the obstacles with the Israeli occupation. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1418.2800000000002s)]
*  And now what it means to me, it means that I can share this light of hope, not only with [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1422.72s)]
*  my uncle's spirit that might be hovering above us, but also with the children who are [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1428.44s)]
*  living in painful conditions in Gaza, the children who lost their parents, who lost [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1434.6000000000001s)]
*  their friends, their family members, who have been terrorized with all of the pain [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1441.32s)]
*  and the destruction and the bombing. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1448.9199999999998s)]
*  I tell them that there is a way moving forward, and that way is education. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  Education is light. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  Education is hope. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1458.08s)]
*  And education is the path to move forward. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1459.32s)]
*  You're not only hoping to graduate next week walking with your classmates, but then [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1463.08s)]
*  you want to go on to SIPA, to the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1469.8s)]
*  graduate school, where you've been accepted. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1474.8s)]

*  activities. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  This is also to fulfill the dream that I have, the dream of peacemaking, of conflict resolution. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  This is the whole point I came to Columbia, and this is the whole point why I am going [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1493.0s)]
*  to study at SIPA. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1498.0400000000002s)]
*  The American government, as it seems to me, they don't want me to continue my education. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1500.88s)]
*  They didn't want me to graduate, and they don't want me to get my master's degree. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1506.0s)]
*  I also have to share that what happens at Columbia University matters for the rest of [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1512.44s)]
*  America. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1518.44s)]
*  The Columbia University administration, as I have been witnessing it, has been participating [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1519.92s)]
*  in the deterioration and destruction of the democratic system. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1526.6000000000001s)]
*  They are not listening to their students. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1530.44s)]
*  The students have, like the majority of the student body, have voted to divest from war [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1533.0s)]
*  any entities that are supporting the apartheid and the genocide. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1538.68s)]
*  Columbia University administration is not listening, and in a matter of a few days I [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1542.44s)]
*  will be walking, and I will be walking with a conflict, mixed feelings. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1548.2s)]
*  The feeling that I love this university that has given me tools to express my thoughts [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1554.2s)]
*  and to yearn and to achieve my dreams for freedom and for justice. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1558.8400000000001s)]
*  And the other feeling is that I feel deeply disappointed by the Columbia University administration. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1564.32s)]
*  And I know that it's going to continue to be a struggle while I am going to be finalizing [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1571.64s)]
*  my master's degree. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1577.92s)]

*  those determining his fate. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1598.92s)]

*  I say the same message that don't give up. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1607.8s)]
*  And don't give up on the idea of justice. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1613.56s)]
*  Justice is inevitable. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1617.32s)]
*  It's a matter of time. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1618.32s)]
*  And don't give into despair. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1620.44s)]
*  What we are seeing with my release, with Ramesa's release, and with Dr. Khan's release, those [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1622.98s)]
*  are light of hope. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1631.02s)]
*  And you will be next. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1632.48s)]
*  And we will be able to celebrate you very, very soon. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1634.8s)]
*  The same message that the Gazan people have been sending to us, we're gaining strength [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GCJki3pMg&t=1638.6s)]
