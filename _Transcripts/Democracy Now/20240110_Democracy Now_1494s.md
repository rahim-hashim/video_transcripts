# ​​Why I Resigned: Tariq Habash Is First Biden Appointee to Quit over U.S.-Backed Israeli War on Gaza
**Democracy Now!:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JILGqsk8sd4)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  JUAN GONZÁLEZ, New York City Senator-Elect, New York.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  We begin today's show looking at Gaza, where the death toll from Israel's assault has
*  topped 23,300.
*  On Tuesday, during a trip to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the
*  And the civilian death toll in Gaza is, quote, far too high, but he refused to call for a
*  ceasefire.
*  Facing an enemy that embeds itself among civilians, who hides in and fires from schools, from
*  hospitals, makes this incredibly challenging.
*  But the daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high.
*  We want this war to end as soon as possible.
*  There's been far too much loss of life, far too much suffering.
*  But it's vital that Israel achieve its very legitimate objectives of ensuring that October
*  7th can never happen again.
*  That was Tony Blinken speaking in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Blinken met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas today in Ramallah and the Occupied West
*  Bank.
*  During Tuesday's press conference, Blinken went on to say Israel must not press Palestinians
*  to leave Gaza and that the region needs to find a pathway to a Palestinian state.
*  We continue to discuss how to build a more durable peace and security for Israel within
*  the region.
*  As I told the prime minister, every partner that I met on this trip said that they're
*  ready to support a lasting solution that ends the long-running cycle of violence and ensures
*  Israel's security.
*  But they underscored that this can only come through a regional approach that includes
*  a pathway to a Palestinian state.
*  Blinken's trip to Israel and the Middle East comes as the Biden administration faces
*  mounting criticism for supporting and arming Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  We begin today's show with Tarak Habash.
*  Last week, he became the first Biden appointee and just the second administration official
*  overall to publicly resign from the Biden administration to protest Biden's support
*  for Israel's war on Gaza.
*  Tarak Habash is a Palestinian-American Christian who worked as a senior official at the U.S.
*  Department of Education.
*  In his resignation letter, he wrote, quote, I cannot stay silent as this administration
*  turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives and what
*  leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government,
*  unquote.
*  Tarak Habash, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Thanks so much for joining us.
*  Can you talk about your decision-making, at what point you decided you had to leave the
*  Biden administration, how long you've worked for him and what you think of what's happening
*  right now?
*  Thank you so much, Amy, and thanks, Juan.
*  You know, for me, this was an incredibly difficult decision.
*  In a lot of ways, I was working my dream job.
*  I was working for a president who for years touted himself as an individual of empathy,
*  a president, a leader who cared about our education system, about labor rights, about
*  health care, about the environment.
*  In a lot of ways, I was extremely aligned with the entire domestic policy agenda of
*  President Biden, and I was able to work on issues that I truly cared about.
*  You know, I was part of the administration from the very beginning, coming up on three
*  full years working in this administration, and even before that, I volunteered my time
*  as someone who assisted the campaign on the policy development of that agenda with respect
*  to higher education and student debt.
*  But it was really difficult, as someone who both cared deeply about American democracy
*  and cared deeply about improving the lives of millions of Americans, to also feel like
*  it was untenable to work for and represent an administration and a president that put
*  conditions on my own humanity, that didn't believe that Palestinian lives were equal
*  to the lives of other people.
*  And that was just a really, really hard thing to deal with.
*  And so for me, it wasn't a particular moment in time.
*  I think it was a culmination of near-daily dehumanization of Palestinian lives in Gaza,
*  in the West Bank, and policy and rhetoric that never really shifted over the last three
*  months.
*  And I think we even heard that yesterday from the secretary of state, unfortunately.
*  Tarek, I'm wondering, did you try to express your perspective or your viewpoints to people
*  in the administration?
*  And I'm wondering also what the response was of your direct boss, Education Secretary
*  Miguel Cardona, when you decided to resign.
*  Yeah, I mean, I used every avenue available to me to be able to express my concerns, both
*  about the language that the administration, the White House, was using to express concerns
*  about the policies and how it undermines the president's message on protecting democracy,
*  on how it undermines our stature across the international community with respect to, like,
*  being humanitarians and caring about human life.
*  And yeah, I spoke with the secretary on numerous occasions about this issue.
*  I spoke with the assistant secretaries.
*  I spoke with the secretary's chief of staff.
*  They were all extremely understanding of my personal plight and my personal frustration.
*  And you know, they were very supportive of me on a personal level, emotionally understanding,
*  checking on me to make sure that I was doing okay.
*  And even in circumstances where the White House did listening sessions and had policy
*  briefings for staff in particular, you know, I was there.
*  I tried to raise concerns, as did many of my peers and colleagues.
*  I think there was a different tone in the reception from the White House than, say,
*  the Department of Education in particular, but I think the outcomes, unfortunately, didn't
*  change anything.
*  I think we continued to see doubling down on the current policies that have led us to
*  which is the unconditional support of military funding and resources to an extremist Israeli
*  regime that continues to both indiscriminately bomb Palestinians in Gaza and starve millions of people.
*  And you mentioned that you had participated in the President Biden's original campaign.
*  What do you sense is the implication for his reelection campaign of the deep dissatisfaction
*  not only among employees in his administration, but of young progressive and liberal Americans
*  across the spectrum?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that there are huge implications.
*  I think we're already seeing those implications.
*  The president is now really gearing up for the 2024 election.
*  We're months away, and we're seeing his poll numbers really hitting real lows, particularly
*  in communities that are predominantly minority, predominantly younger.
*  We're seeing a backlash, I think, in part to these policies and to our response, and
*  it feels like it's out of touch with the president's message around protecting democracy
*  from authoritarianism.
*  I think the president has spoken very directly to the American people about how important
*  2024 is in terms of protecting our democracy.
*  I think that is absolutely true, but it's also just not in line with the foreign policy
*  approach to the region and to Gaza in particular as we are seeing the president and the administration
*  provide unconditional support to an authoritarian Israeli government.
*  Tara Kamash, what has been the response of your colleagues to quitting?
*  And you talked about the difference between the response of the Department of Education
*  and the White House.
*  Have you gotten word from the White House?
*  I haven't heard from the White House.
*  I have heard from countless colleagues across the federal government, people who I've
*  worked very closely with, people who I didn't have the opportunity to work with, and people
*  who we had numerous touch points across the three years that I was at the Department of
*  Education.
*  And that response has been incredibly supportive.
*  I couldn't imagine the level of understanding and support and alignment with so many people.
*  I think we've heard a lot about the level of dissent across the federal government with
*  the administration's current policies.
*  I think we've seen numerous dissent cables from the State Department be leaked.
*  We've seen letters from USAID, from dozens of federal agencies, from interns dissent
*  within the White House.
*  I mean, it is across the board.
*  But I think there's also so much more that we don't even realize, because there are
*  limitations to how people can share that information and use the channels that are available to
*  them.
*  For me at the Department of Education and other domestic agencies, there aren't the
*  same types of private channels that State Department has for dissent cables for Foreign
*  Service officers and other employees.
*  I was fortunate because I had leadership that cared about me on a personal level, that wanted
*  to check on me, and told me that if there were things that I wanted to communicate to
*  the White House, to the highest levels of the White House, those messages would be communicated.
*  The vast majority of people don't have that level of access and support from their leadership,
*  from their agencies, and they don't have those structures in place.
*  So I think, in a lot of ways, the White House doesn't even know the level of dissent within
*  its own ranks, and I think that's concerning.
*  On Monday, President Biden spoke at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  That's where the white supremacist, Dylann Roof, shot dead eight black parishioners and
*  their pastor in 2015, Clementa Pickney.
*  Biden's speech was disrupted when a group of activists started chanting,
*  Cease Fire Now.
*  Without light, there's no path from this darkness.
*  If you really care about the lives lost here, then you should honor the lives lost and call
*  for a ceasefire in Palestine.
*  Ceasefire now!
*  Ceasefire now!
*  Ceasefire now!
*  Ceasefire now!
*  As the protesters called for a ceasefire and were removed from the church, supporters of
*  Biden started chanting four more years.
*  President Biden then addressed the protest.
*  I understand their passion, and I've been quietly working with the Israeli government
*  to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza, using all that I can to do.
*  I was wondering, Tarek, if you think President Biden's line has changed at all.
*  Reports are he's called his top aides to the White House, absolutely furious why his poll
*  numbers are so low, when the poll figures show people are so dismayed at what's happening now.
*  I wanted to quote a retired Israeli Major General, Yitzhak Brick, who conceded in November
*  all of our missiles, the ammunition, the precision-guided bombs, all the airplanes and
*  bombs, it's all from the U.S. He said, the minute they turn off the tap, you can't keep
*  fighting. You have no capability. Everyone understands that we can't fight this war
*  without the United States, period. Talk about what you think Biden understands and what he needs to
*  do right now.
*  I think it's really important to recognize that American voters see this as a domestic policy
*  issue, just as much as a foreign policy issue. It is affecting what is going to happen in the
*  upcoming election. I think people are really dissatisfied with the response of the administration.
*  I think that we're seeing that in the church a couple days ago with the protests. We're seeing it
*  with protests across the country. We're seeing city council members, the president, the president
*  city council members and local legislators and policymakers take stances to support an
*  immediate ceasefire. That disconnect from the people is really concerning for American
*  democracy, but it's concerning because it feels like digging into the current position
*  means that it's not as valuable to listen to the people and that our policymakers are going to make
*  decisions that they're going to make. I think when we see an administration circumvent Congress
*  by issuing hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons to a foreign government and circumventing
*  the processes that are in place, ignoring really important laws to protect both Americans but also
*  abide by international humanitarian law, I think there are significant implications for what that
*  means for America more broadly. Tarek, I wanted to ask you, in your work at the education department,
*  you were focused particularly on higher education. I'm wondering what's your response to what's been
*  happening on so many campuses across the country and the politicians in, or some politicians,
*  in Congress trying to support and build up the retaliation and targeting campaign faced by
*  Palestinian rights advocates at the university campuses.
*  I'm so glad you asked that question. I feel like, so I already mentioned a little bit how
*  Americans don't feel like this is just an issue away from home. This is also a domestic policy issue.
*  I think that is extremely clear on college campuses that have for decades been the grounds for public
*  dissent, for protests, for being able to have a free exchange of ideas and communicate on issues
*  that are really difficult. I think American higher education is meant to be a place to allow
*  free speech in all of its forms. I think that's really important. I think the department of
*  education recognizes that, but I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done. I think it's
*  very clear the overcorrection that we've seen by institutions of higher education and their response
*  to the weaponization of language in particular on college campuses and by political officials and
*  right-wing extremists. I think at the end of the day, we need to ensure that students are safe,
*  but we need to provide safe learning environments that do not infringe on their rights to be able
*  to have those difficult conversations, to learn about issues that matter in the world right now.
*  This particular conflict is the forefront of those conversations in so many ways. I think when we see
*  students on college campuses show solidarity with the Palestinian struggle, when we see students on
*  college campuses condemn the daily atrocities that we see that are starving millions of Palestinians
*  and decades of oppression and occupation that have led to unequal rights for Palestinians,
*  I think that it's really important that we separate that from actual hate speech that is
*  real and dangerous and growing across the country. I think that we've seen politicians rely on the
*  weaponization of language in order to minimize students' ability to organize and to speak about
*  some really difficult issues, and we've seen that really affect the independence and the integrity
*  of American higher education, and the risks to academic freedom are very real, and that is a
*  responsibility for the Department of Education. I think that was one reason for me why it took so long
*  to really take this position, because I did feel an obligation on the issues that I work directly on
*  to be able to help move the ball forward and provide as much support as possible to students
*  across the country. I'm wondering, you were still there, Tarek, at the Department of Education when
*  the three Palestinian students were shot in Burlington, one from Trinity, one from Haverford,
*  and one from Brown, Hisham Awartani, who is paralyzed from the chest down.
*  And I was wondering your response there and within the department. And also, if you feel
*  you face a different future than someone like Josh Paul, longtime State Department
*  official, who quit over Biden administration policy. You are a Biden appointee. But if you face
*  something different as a Palestinian American?
*  Yeah, absolutely. Just to quickly touch on what happened in Vermont, which is absolutely
*  horrific, I think part of the problem is the constant dehumanization of Palestinians and
*  what we've seen both in the language that the White House has used and in what we have seen in
*  terms of coverage here across the United States, in the media, making it seem like Palestinians,
*  and in particular, Palestinian men, are less deserving of support of humanity, of emotion.
*  That allows people to feel like attacking them is acceptable. And that's just, that's a horrifying
*  thing to realize is that as a Palestinian, as a Palestinian man, as a Palestinian Christian,
*  so many aspects of my own identity are erased on a daily basis. And it's truly horrifying that we
*  allow that type of dehumanization to exist in our country today. For me, it's very personal and,
*  yeah.
*  And talk about your background, Tarek, your family's background, your history.
*  Yeah, you know, I'm an American. I was born in the United States. I was born in the United States
*  and I'm a Palestinian American. I'm a Palestinian Christian. My family has been Christians for as
*  far back as we know. And in 1948, my grandparents and many of my aunts and uncles who were alive at
*  the time were forcibly displaced from their homes in Yaffa and forcibly displaced from their homes
*  in the United States. And I'm a Palestinian American. I'm a Palestinian American. I'm a
*  Palestinian American. I'm a Palestinian American. I'm a Palestinian American. I'm a Palestinian
*  were forcibly displaced from their homes in Yaffa. And for those who don't know, it's on the water,
*  essentially where Tel Aviv is today. And they had to leave everything. They left their homes,
*  they left their businesses, they left their friends. They saw a huge migration, a forced
*  migration of their peers and massive levels of death. And for them, it was about self-preservation,
*  about preserving future generations of their family. And they walked for miles to find somewhere
*  safe. And I think it was happenstance that, you know, someone told them, oh, we think it's safe
*  toward the east. Let's walk that direction. And as a Palestinian living in America, as a Palestinian
*  living in the broader diaspora, not being able to return, there's a level of guilt that you have
*  knowing that a decision that was made 75 years ago to walk east instead of south toward Gaza
*  changed the entire trajectory of your life, changed the trajectory of your family's lives,
*  because, you know, my family has been here in the States for a long time.
*  But I could have very easily been in Gaza. My family could have been in Gaza.
*  It's extremely emotional. And you feel guilty because you are safe. And you can't do enough to
*  protect lives that are being taken indiscriminately. What are your plans now, Tarek?
*  I don't know. You know, I think this is such an important issue. I'm doing everything I can
*  just to use whatever channels that I have to communicate about how important it is to end
*  the violence immediately, to preserve as many lives as possible. I think we've heard the White
*  House and the Secretary of State talk repeatedly about minimizing civilian casualties. We can do
*  a lot better than minimizing them. We can end civilian casualties in Gaza and in the West Bank.
*  I think it's up to us to make that decision, to do a little bit of introspection on our
*  own policies and positions and recognize that it's been over three months. The military route
*  has been an epic failure. And the only path to peace, as the Secretary of State talked about
*  just yesterday, is a diplomatic one. And when we talk about providing humanitarian aid and increasing
*  the level of aid that's getting to people in Gaza who are starving, it's really hard to do that if
*  there is continuous bombing of all of the safe regions. There's nowhere safe left. There hasn't
*  been anywhere safe left for weeks and weeks. It's really important that you end the violence so that
*  you can provide the level of support that's needed if we want to seriously contemplate a future for
*  Palestinians.
