**Democracy Now!:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4mLaM1yFxU)
*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report, Democracy Now!
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  International pressures mounting against Israel's planned ground invasion of Ra'afah, which
*  now hosts more than a million displaced Gazans who were once told the southern area was a
*  safe zone.
*  President Biden spoke Monday after meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah at the White
*  House.
*  The king and I also discussed the situation in Ra'afah.
*  As I said yesterday, our military operation in Ra'afah, the major military operation
*  in Ra'afah, should not proceed without a credible plan, a credible plan for ensuring
*  the safety and support of more than one million people sheltered there.
*  Biden quickly corrected himself after describing Israel's operation in Ra'afah as, quote,
*  our operation.
*  Jordan also said his administration is working on a six-week ceasefire in Gaza.
*  CIA Director William Burns is in Cairo for more truce talks.
*  Despite Biden's comments, he's refused to impose any conditions on billions of dollars
*  the U.S. continues to send to Israel.
*  This is National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby being questioned by a reporter.
*  Does the president ever threaten to strip military assistance from Israel if they move
*  ahead with a Ra'afah operation that does not take into consequence what happens with
*  civilians?
*  We're going to continue to support Israel.
*  They have a right to defend themselves against Hamas, and we're going to continue to make
*  sure they have the tools and the capabilities to do that.
*  Israeli airstrikes in Ra'afah already killed at least 100 people overnight into Monday.
*  As the IDF carried out a rescue operation to free two Israeli Argentine hostages, this
*  is a young Palestinian girl injured and lost her father in the Israeli strikes.
*  We were in the tent, me and all my family, when the bullets came at us.
*  My father went to see what's happening and said there were strikes.
*  And a strike happened while he was talking.
*  We all fled.
*  My father was martyred.
*  While in the car, he kept saying, I bear witness that there is one God, and he died.
*  Amnesty International says Ra'afah's population has seen a five-fold increase since the Israeli
*  assault started on October 7th.
*  In a new report, Amnesty is calling for a war crimes investigation into Israeli strikes
*  in Ra'afah in December and January that killed nearly 100 civilians, almost half of them
*  children.
*  This comes as Palestinian health officials say Israeli forces have killed over 12,300
*  children in the Gaza Strip in just over four months.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli violence in the occupied West Bank continues to intensify.
*  At least 22 people, including a child, were arrested in overnight raids in Jenin and other
*  areas.
*  There have been over 7,000 arrests in the occupied West Bank since October 7th.
*  Detained Palestinians say they're being violently attacked in prison.
*  Meanwhile, a group of U.N. special rapporteurs says Israel's undercover killings of three
*  Palestinian men at the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin last month may amount to extrajudicial
*  killings and violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian
*  law.
*  U.N. experts said, quote, by disguising themselves as seemingly harmless, protected medical personnel
*  and civilians, the Israeli forces also prima facie committed the war crime of perfidy,
*  unquote.
*  Perfidy describes a deception involving an abuse of good faith.
*  Protesters took to the streets around the United States Monday as fear mounts over an
*  all-out attack in Ra'afah.
*  Police took place outside the White House and Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and
*  other major cities.
*  Around 20 activists with Sunrise Movement were arrested as they occupied Biden's Wilmington,
*  Delaware campaign headquarters, warning he's at risk of losing millions of youth votes
*  in November.
*  Here in New York, protesters blocked cars around Grand Central.
*  Activists led by Jewish-American groups rallied outside Senator Chuck Schumer's office.
*  Earlier in the day, protesters gathered for an emergency protest at Union Square, led
*  by the group within our lifetime.
*  Democracy Now is there.
*  My name is Nardin Keswani.
*  We cannot sit by idly and watch our people be massacred, and we will do whatever it takes
*  to stop it.
*  We will continue to protest.
*  They shut down our Instagram page.
*  The police are starting to be more brutal, more horrific with their arrests and attacks
*  on the movement to free Palestine in an effort to shut us down, because public opinion shows,
*  these protests shows, that the people of New York City and the people of the United States
*  stand with Palestine.
*  The U.S. Senate passed a $95 billion military funding package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan
*  in the predawn hours this morning, but the bill's fate remains unclear after House
*  Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed the measure over its failure to include hardline immigration
*  restrictions.
*  This comes after Johnson and other Republicans rejected an earlier version of the bill, which
*  did contain the border crackdown they demanded.
*  Johnson has told Republican Congress members he will call a House vote on a standalone
*  funding bill for Israel.
*  Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to intervene and halt a D.C. appeals court ruling
*  that rejected Trump's claims of total immunity for his actions following his 2020 election
*  loss.
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump on four counts over his efforts to overturn
*  the election.
*  Two lower courts have already rejected Trump's presidential immunity argument.
*  Trump's lawyers are also asking the D.C. court to reconsider his claim with its full
*  panel of judges.
*  In related news, the judge overseeing Georgia's election subversion case against Donald Trump
*  said Monday District Attorney Fannie Willis could be disqualified over her past romantic
*  relationship with the lead prosecutor in the case if she benefited financially.
*  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for Thursday.
*  In India, police fired tear gas at thousands of farmers marching toward New Delhi protesting
*  for better working protections and to be paid a higher value for their crops.
*  He sealed several entry points into New Delhi with barricades of barbed wire, cement blocks
*  and spikes.
*  Some of the protesters were arrested.
*  This is a leader with the Punjab Farmers Union.
*  See how peacefully the farmers are marching yet the police are dropping tear gas shells
*  from drones hovering in the sky.
*  In Trinidad and Tobago, officials declared a national emergency Sunday after a massive
*  by an overturned vessel blackened several miles of Tobago's southern shores covering
*  beaches with thick oil.
*  It's still unclear how much oil has spilled while the government has yet to identify the
*  owner of the largely submerged vessel found off the coast last week.
*  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, protests broke out Monday near U.N. offices and Western
*  embassies in the capital Kinshasa as anger mounts over the worsening violence and humanitarian
*  crisis in eastern Congo.
*  Demonstrators burned U.S. and other flags denouncing Western nations' support of Rwanda,
*  which is accused of backing the M23 militia and their complicity in the conflict.
*  We are claiming our rights.
*  France and the United States are fostering the war in the eastern DRC by supporting the
*  rebellion.
*  A country like Rwanda cannot fight against the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*  We are marching.
*  We are not breaking or destroying people's property, but the head of the police is sending
*  his officers to chase us away.
*  This comes as thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes as M23 advanced
*  toward Goma, a key city in eastern Congo.
*  And back here in New York, voters in Long Island and a small section of Queens are casting
*  ballots today to fill the open seat left by disgraced Republican Congress member George
*  Santos.
*  The U.S. House voted to expel Santos in December over campaign finance violations and his many
*  lies about his personal and work history.
*  On the ballot is former Democratic Congress member Tom Swazi, who previously held the
*  seat and is pitching himself as a centrist.
*  The Republican candidate is Mazieh Pilep, a Nassau County legislator who's actually
*  a registered Democrat.
*  She was born in Ethiopia and airlifted to Israel as part of Operation Solomon, where
*  she fought in the Israeli military before moving to the U.S.
*  Republicans control 219 seats in the U.S. House compared to 212 for Democrats.
*  Four House seats are currently vacant.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
