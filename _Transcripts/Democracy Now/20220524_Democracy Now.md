# Debt, Coups & Colonialism in Haiti: France & U.S. Urged to Pay Reparations for Destroying Nation
**Democracy Now!:** [May 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2q98odZz2U)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!
*  co-host Juan González in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
*  Hi, Amy.
*  Welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
*  Well, the ransom.
*  That's the name of a major series of articles published by The New York Times detailing
*  how Haiti became one of the poorest countries in the world, while bankers in France and
*  the United States made a fortune.
*  The story dates back to the early 19th century.
*  In 1804, the enslaved people of Haiti rose up, leading a rebellion against French colonial
*  rule, founding the world's first black republic.
*  After military threat from France in 1825, Haiti agreed to pay reparations to France
*  for lost so-called property, including enslaved people that French owners lost in the rebellion.
*  France threatened to invade Haiti and reimpose slavery if Haiti did not agree to a staggering
*  in reparations, 150 million francs, 30 times Haiti's annual revenue.
*  Haiti began taking out loans from French banks, leading to an economic crisis that continues
*  through to this day.
*  The New York Times estimates Haiti paid the equivalent of what's now $560 million to
*  France over the next seven decades.
*  The true economic cost to Haiti is estimated to be an astounding $115 billion, and that
*  only tells a part of the story.
*  In 1880, a French bank established Haiti's first national bank, essentially putting France
*  in control of Haiti's treasury.
*  That bank, Crédit Industriel et Commerciel, used some of its massive profits to help finance
*  the Eiffel Tower.
*  The bank's current owner has just launched an investigation into its dealings with Haiti
*  and its role in what's called the ecosystem of colonialism, that bank, CIC.
*  The Time series also looks at the U.S. military occupation of Haiti that lasted from 1915
*  to 1934.
*  A key backer of the U.S. occupation was the National Citibank of New York, the predecessor
*  of Citibank.
*  Former U.S. diplomat Patrick Gaspar, who now heads the Center for American Progress, has
*  called on Citigroup to pay reparations to Haiti.
*  Gaspar wrote on Twitter,
*  "'A silent scream has been in throats for decades about the role U.S. played in depleting
*  Haiti.
*  No one would listen.
*  Finally, some truth,' he said.
*  Over the years, Haitian demands for reparations have been repeatedly shut down, sometimes
*  with force.
*  France's former ambassador to Haiti, Thierry Bucard, admitted to The New York Times that
*  France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that ousted Haiti's first
*  democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
*  Bucard said one benefit of the coup was that it ended Aristide's campaign demanding France
*  pay financial reparations to Haiti.
*  To talk more about Haiti and the devastating impact of colonialism in this massive series
*  in The New York Times, we're joined by two guests.
*  Weston Lee Alsanat is a Haitian-American professor at Fordham University, where he teaches courses
*  on the Atlantic slave trade, the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history.
*  Gerald Horn also joins us.
*  He's professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Houston, author
*  of many books, including Confronting Black Jacobins, the U.S., the Haitian Revolution
*  and the Origins of the Dominican Republic.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  Professor Alsanat, let's begin with you.
*  So, this series has come out in The New York Times to both criticism and praise.
*  It's come out in both Creole and in English.
*  That's a first for The New York Times.
*  Can you explain the significance of what many are calling revelations, at least to the general
*  public?
*  But certainly, people in Haiti have been alleging for centuries, not only alleging, but of course
*  having proof of this.
*  Yes, thank you, Amy.
*  Thank you for having me today.
*  I'm glad to be here in conversation with you.
*  So first, let me start by saying that a great acknowledgement to the many reporters and
*  producers who put this very special issue together and to have given it a front-time
*  exposure will mean a lot.
*  Not really for Haitians, per se, because the facts that are being revealed throughout the
*  report are very well known, even to the most illiterate Haitian and even to the youngest
*  Haitian growing up.
*  In fact, given the level of underdevelopment that is prevalent in Haiti today, one knows,
*  at least the Haitian people knows, that this could have only been the legacy of an external
*  force, rather of their own making.
*  So I think the significance of the piece will be that it exposes the rest of the world to
*  a knowledge that actually has existed for over 100 years and shares multiple partners,
*  both in the private sector with regards to the financial industry, as well as the United
*  States government, Germany, Great Britain, and most certainly, and most influential,
*  having played a role in imposing the debt that, in many ways, will explain Haiti's
*  poverty today.
*  So I welcome the piece.
*  I think it's great in terms of the many research that it brought together, both from
*  academic literature that had already existed, as well as new revelations that are coming
*  up.
*  But in terms of calling it revelations, that would be a misnomer.
*  I myself have written it very extensively on the subject.
*  Many other fellow academics, historians have written about it.
*  There have been movements over the decades to get the United States, France, and the
*  other parties responsible for this to get them to some accountability.
*  And I believe a large reason why this never got the fair sort of ear of listening that
*  it's because it's coming from Haitians, who many people view as sort of the Africans
*  of the Western Hemisphere, but which is an identity that Haitians proudly wear, wear
*  proudly for reasons that reasonably make sense for it in terms of the freedom that they
*  fought and established for all black people.
*  Yeah, I'd like to bring in Professor Gerald Horne to the conversation, another historian
*  who has covered the issue of colonialism, imperialism, and slavery throughout the Americas
*  for decades.
*  I, too, had the same feeling that a lot of this is only new to people who haven't paid
*  attention to the history of the Western Hemisphere over the last several hundred years.
*  I'm wondering your reaction to the piece, because the Times really is delving into history
*  much more than news.
*  I think the most interesting aspect of it was the particular individuals in France and
*  the institutions that directly benefited from the ransom that Haiti was forced to pay.
*  Largely, this is a history that is known by people who know any part of the history of
*  Latin America and of the Western Hemisphere.
*  So I'm wondering your reaction to the piece as a historian who studied this carefully.
*  Well, first of all, I would urge and encourage the New York Times to follow through with
*  their point that they have uncovered new documents by putting these documents online so that
*  other historians can take advantage of their excavations and or, secondly, placing them
*  at the New York Times archive, which I believe has been cited at the New York Public Library.
*  But I think that the story also is of significance and of moment for us in the United States,
*  for we in the United States, because there has been this myth that has been created that
*  the United States and the Haitian Revolution were twins, even though we know, as I begin
*  my book on the Haitian Revolution, George Washington, the founding father of this country,
*  was quite nervous about the eruption in Haiti in August 1791.
*  And this was understandable because the Haitian Revolution, culminating in 1804,
*  led to a general crisis of the entire slave system in the Americas that could only be resolved with
*  its collapse. Therefore, the United States was probably second to France in being an antagonist
*  of the Haitian people. From their point of view, this was a reaction to the fact
*  that many of the slave revolts in the United States had Haitian fingerprints all over them.
*  I'm speaking of Gabriel's Revolt in Virginia in 1800, the Revolt in Louisiana circa 1811,
*  Denmark Vesce about a decade later in South Carolina. In fact, Vesce had sailed in and out
*  of Haiti before that eruption in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  And then, culminating this hostility to Haiti, there is substantial evidence to suggest that
*  when the island, the island that we refer to as Hispaniola, was split in 1844 with the secession
*  from Haiti of what became the Dominican Republic, that this was an early success for U.S. covert
*  operations. So this story in the New York Times is of significance for we in the United States.
*  Hopefully, it will cause us to reexamine the history of this country and move away from the
*  propaganda point that somehow the United States was an abolitionist republic when actually it was
*  the foremost slaveholders' republic. And I'm wondering also if it wouldn't have been
*  worthwhile for the New York Times to do another piece on its own coverage of Haiti over the past
*  hundred years or so. I'm thinking back, for instance, during the first coup
*  against President Iris Deed when there were numerous articles in the New York Times about
*  how Iris Deed was considered to be mentally unstable and erratic in his behavior, all of it
*  fed to it by intelligence sources, and even the Times' coverage perhaps of the U.S. occupation,
*  that long occupation in the early 20th century, the Times seems to be willing to go after France
*  and the U.S., but really doesn't look at its own role in creating the narrative of Haiti as a
*  dysfunctional country. I'm wondering what you think about that, Gerald.
*  Well, you're absolutely correct. Obviously, criticism should be accompanied by self-criticism,
*  and there is much work to be done in that sphere by the New York Times. You mentioned the occupation
*  1915 to 1934. The New York Times did not necessarily stress and emphasize in their coverage
*  the mass opposition to the U.S. occupation, particularly by Black Americans, particularly
*  by a founder of the NAACP, speaking of W.E.B. Du Bois, who, as you know, his ancestral roots
*  were in fact on the island, and he led a vigorous campaign against this murderous and bloodthirsty
*  occupation that in some ways involved the reassertion of unpaid labor, the so-called
*  corvée, as it was called euphemistically in Haiti, and the New York Times would do well to reexamine
*  its own coverage, because hopefully that would improve today's coverage.
*  Well, I want to go back to 2004. Juan just referred to this. France's former ambassador to Haiti
*  has admitted France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that
*  overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president.
*  The former French ambassador Thierry Bucquart told the New York Times one benefit of the coup
*  was that it ended Aristide's campaign demanding France pay reparations to Haiti.
*  I want to turn to an interview we did with Kim Ives of Haiti Liberté. This was right after
*  President Aristide was put on a plane and sent to the Central African Republic.
*  This was what Kim Ives described.
*  Put aside to get Aristide out between the ruling groups in Haiti, the compredors bourgeoisie and
*  the big landowners who generally are constantly squabbling throughout Haitian history for power.
*  They put aside their differences to get together, which we see with Andy Uphead representing the
*  bourgeoisie and Guy Philippe and Jodelle Champlain, more the M'coute wing. And we saw the France and
*  the U.S. who have also been sort of vying, put aside their differences. So you saw this
*  union, unity come between rivals against Aristide because he represented the people and because he
*  was a representative of popular will in Haiti.
*  So just to be clear, this is mid-March 2004 that Kim Ives was speaking. Right after that,
*  Democracy Now!, I flew to the Central African Republic on a small plane covering a group of
*  African-American activists and politicians, including Randall Robinson of TransAfrica,
*  as well as Congressmember Maxine Waters, who went to the Central African Republic to retrieve the
*  Aristides and then brought them back to the Western hemisphere as the U.S. government was saying,
*  how dare you bring them to this hemisphere, to which Randall Robinson responded, whose hemisphere?
*  They eventually brought them to Haiti and the Aristides then went to exile in South Africa for
*  years before they eventually went back to Haiti, where they are today.
*  I'd like to get response, starting with Professor Horn and then Professor Alsenat,
*  about the significance of these coups, whether we're talking about Aristide in the early 90s or
*  again in 2004, the coups against them and what that meant for this country. I mean,
*  no precedent, again, would demand reparations.
*  Well, the reparations question is obviously key. Keep in mind that what makes the United States
*  unique is that the slave owners were expropriated. Their property and the bodies of enslaved Africans
*  was taken without compensation. That helped to give rise to the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan.
*  In Haiti, as we've been discussing, the Haitians were obligated to pay back, believe it or not,
*  the enslavers. And likewise, if you look at the British possession, so-called Jamaica, Barbados,
*  etc., you had London compensate the enslavers, and by some measures, that total was not paid off until
*  just a few years ago. And so this question of reparations is quite key. And also quite key is
*  the role of Haiti in helping to ignite this entire process of abolition, leading to capital
*  loss, not least in the United States of America. The enslaving class and their descendants have a
*  very long memory. They have not forgotten Haiti's role. That's why they continued to punish Haiti
*  for having the temerity to rise up against slavery. And even today, they continue to
*  punish Haiti because they see Haiti as a haven for low-wage labor. U.S. baseballs in the U.S.
*  national pastime are largely manufactured by cheap labor in Haiti. So there is still much to sort out
*  with regard to this entire controversy. And, Professor Alcindor, if you could also
*  respond right through today to the U.S. diplomat Patrick Yaspard, who now runs Center for American
*  Progress, demanding Citibank launch an investigation, and the whole issue of
*  reparations, whether you could see it actually being real, given the devastation of Haiti.
*  Okay. Thank you, Amy. I think I want to quickly go back to
*  what was asked with regards to The New York Times. Let me remind our audience that it was in 2010,
*  not just days after an earthquake had devastated the country and killed upwards of 200,000
*  and more people, that The New York Times provided a platform for one of its columnists, David Brooks,
*  to say some of the most racist things that I've ever read in The New York Times about Haiti.
*  So if we are going to also give The New York Times the credit for what is a phenomenal job
*  about talking on this issue, they should also start by apologizing for what Mr. Brooks had said
*  then, which let me quote real quick. Haiti, like most of the world's poorest nations,
*  suffers from a complex web of progress-resistant cultural influences. There is the influence of
*  the Voodoo religion, which spreads the message that life is capricious and planning futile.
*  There are high levels of social mistrust. Responsibility is often not internalized.
*  Child-rearing practices often involve neglect in the early years and harsh retribution when
*  kids hit nine or 10. We're all supposed to politely respect each other's cultures, but some cultures
*  are more progress-resistant than others, and the horrible tragedy was just exacerbated by one of
*  them. So I call on The New York Times to both acknowledge these statements of racist demography
*  on its pages from Mr. David Brooks. As anyone can judge for themselves, they can go back and look
*  at the op-ed and its pseudo-intellectual anthropologizing of Haitians. So that's one.
*  With regards to Mr. Gaspar, I believe he actually served in the Obama administration.
*  Most people should know that President Obama, being himself the first black African-American
*  president of the United States, actually never made an official visit to the first black republic
*  in the world, the very nation without which Mr. Obama would have not assumed the role
*  of leading a society like the United States as he had. So I would like to know from Mr. Gaspar
*  why is that the administration never actually took the very official position that he is taking
*  right now with regards to Haitian poverty and underdevelopment and the explicit role that the
*  United States, France, Canada and Germany have played in all of that. And then lastly, I just
*  want to respond to your question with regards to just the immensity of the debt and the destructive
*  legacy it has had for Haiti. The tragedy of all of this is that even once this debt is paid,
*  if it were to ever be paid, which I, like Professor Horn, I believe there are parties that are invested
*  in never actually realizing that possibility, even if that debt were to be paid, we are already
*  talking about decades of gaps in development that were missed in the process because of
*  where the money was going, something like upwards to 80% of all Haitian expenditures
*  up until the early part of the 20th century was going to financing the debt. And the fact that
*  American firms from Wall Street and cohorts with the federal government in terms of
*  the State Department, the Navy, and you have names like General Smedley Butler, who actually
*  wrote about his role as a Marine in Haiti and how he secured the interests of the financial
*  corporate groups, as well as working with the State Department to make sure that Haiti
*  becomes a haven for capitalism, as he said. And also, we can even see FDR, President Franklin
*  Delano Roosevelt himself had been Secretary of the Navy upon the time that Haiti was invaded and
*  becoming a protectorate, essentially, of the United States. And he too had professed to actually
*  amending the Haitian Constitution to take out a very revolutionary constitutional
*  clause that had banned white males from owning land in Haiti. Among the first constitutional
*  clauses that the occupation targeted was that, and therefore opened the country up to internal
*  meddling by the international powers. But lastly, I just want to also note the fact that
*  with regards to what you had said about the Eiffel Tower, Credit Industrial, which is now a part of
*  Credit Agricole, one of the largest banks in the world, I think among the 10th largest banks in the
*  world, having funded the building of the Eiffel Tower, which is now this massive monument to French
*  industrial progress, that was happening at a moment in which the United States, France, Germany,
*  and parts of Western Europe were developing rapidly from the capital that they were extracting
*  from many of their former colonies or their current colonies. So imagine what would the history
*  of development in Haiti be today if at the same time that the world is undergoing industrial
*  transformations, the likes of which we see today in the form of the Eiffel Tower, what if that money
*  was taken from Haiti, financing French infrastructure was financing Haitian infrastructure
*  instead. The fact of the matter is there is no progress-resistant genes that somehow Haitians
*  are born with. Perhaps someone like David Brooks was born with some progress-resistant gene as he
*  is unable to fathom that Haitians can take care of themselves. But the truth goes to show where the
*  receipts are in terms of why we know Haiti is in the position that it is today.
*  JUAN GONZÁLEZ S. FONSECA, JR. I'd like to ask Gerald Horne, the bank aspect of this reporting,
*  which to me is, I think, the most newsworthy in that the Times actually was able to get a hold
*  in French archives of financial arrangements that were made between banking interests in France
*  and Haiti, as well as it's uncovering or more deeply uncovering the role of First National City
*  Bank in the early 20th century in Haiti. So I think that this is some of the best stuff in this
*  report. But it's almost like, hey, New York Times discovers imperialism. Isn't the role of Wall
*  Street and European banks in controlling the economies not just of Haiti, but of Honduras,
*  of Nicaragua, of Cuba, of many of these countries in Latin America part of the
*  the operational mold of American imperialism?
*  GERALD HORNE, JR. Most definitely. And I think that the series, laudable as it has been,
*  could also have made a contribution if it had pointed out the close connections between
*  France and the United States. That is to say, in the 20th century, they began to talk about
*  the Citibank and Citicorp and how it was involved in the depredations inflicted upon Haiti.
*  But I think that if you were to go back to the Haitian Revolutionary period,
*  you would also find similar connections. After all, we know that what became the United States
*  was involved in a revolt against London that would not have succeeded without the assistance
*  of France. We know that there was substantial French migration to the United States and that
*  Frenchmen were involved in similar depredations in Louisiana and slave-owning, for example.
*  We know that when Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836, that Texas' major diplomatic ally on the
*  international front happened to be France. And we also know that when the United States Civil War
*  erupted 1861 to 1865, it was France that opportunistically chose that moment to try to
*  seize and occupy Mexico and then extend the lease on life of slavery in Texas and throughout the
*  South by welcoming slave owners from Texas and from Dixie into French-occupied Mexico.
*  And it took a mass revolt by the Mexican people to overturn that particular scheme. So there is much
*  more digging and excavation that needs to be done. And I would like to reiterate my call for The New
*  York Times to open the kimono and to disgorge these documents they say that they have uncovered
*  in France so that other scholars and other researchers can examine same.
*  We haven't even talked about the Louisiana Purchase, but we can't in this show. However,
*  I want to end on the crisis that Haitians confront today when they try to come into the United States.
*  I think it was last September the U.S. Special Envoy to Haiti resigned in protest over the
*  Biden administration's policies in a letter, the longtime diplomat, U.S. Envoy to Haiti Daniel
*  Foote wrote, I will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision
*  to deport thousands of Haitian refugees. Foote also criticized the Biden administration for meddling
*  in Haiti's political affairs, including its support for Ariel Henry as prime minister following
*  the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in July. Foote's resignation came just days
*  after U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback were filmed chasing, grabbing and whipping Haitian asylum
*  seekers who gathered in that makeshift camp in Del Rio, Texas. We only have a minute, Professor
*  Al-Sannat, but the issue of Haitian refugees being deported by the thousands back to a devastated Haiti.
*  Oh, well, real quick, I think what you've just demonstrated is that Haiti stands as a singular
*  metaphor for understanding the racial legacy of imperial powers like the United States and France.
*  In fact, as the war in Ukraine is happening, the sheer magnitude of the difference in the treatment
*  of certain refugees because of their European background relative to say Haitians, as you
*  just showed in terms of what's happening at the border, that's a very revealing example
*  of what Haiti not only means to the United States, but what it means to the world at large in terms of
*  populations from formerly colonized geographies, as well as Black, brown and Indigenous people
*  in this country who knows something about the treatment of racism at the hands of the U.S.
*  government. So in many ways, Haiti should be looked at as a singular metaphor for explaining so many of
*  these various mistreatments and levels of preference for different groups. And I think the more we
*  learn about Haiti, the more we realize how our fate—and this is not an overstatement—our fate
*  is actually directly connected to it, although to better understand what world we're living in with
*  regards to how the powers that be intend to engineer the world towards imperialism.
*  Our fate's intertwined going right back to the U.S. not recognizing Haiti's independence for decades,
*  fearing that a slave uprising would inspire enslaved people in the United States to rise up.
*  Weston Leosana, thanks so much for being with us.
*  Thank you.
*  Haitian-American professor at Fordham University, where he teaches courses on the Atlantic slave
*  trade, the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history. And thank you,
*  Gerald Horn, professor of history and African-American studies at the University of
*  Houston, author of many books, including Confronting Black Jacobins,
*  the U.S., the Haitian Revolution and the Origins of the Dominican Republic.
