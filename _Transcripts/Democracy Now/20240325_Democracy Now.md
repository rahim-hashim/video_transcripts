**Democracy Now!:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_d13ZoGCT4)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Russia, the death toll has risen to 137 from an attack on a popular concert hall in
*  Moscow on Friday.
*  Authorities say gunmen opened fire inside a sold-out rock concert, then set the venue
*  ablaze, the Crocus City Hall.
*  More than 100 people were also injured, many in critical condition.
*  Authorities in Russia have detained 11 people, including four men from Tajikistan, who appeared
*  in court today.
*  They all appeared to have been badly beaten, possibly during in interrogations.
*  One suspect, who was in a wheelchair, seemed to lose consciousness during the court session.
*  Reuters reports he may have had an eye missing.
*  An affiliate of the Islamic State, ISIS-K, has claimed responsibility and posted video
*  of the attack.
*  Russian authorities have suggested Ukraine was involved in the attack, a claim strongly
*  denied by Kiev.
*  We'll have more on the story after headlines, with Professor Nina Khrushcheva and The New
*  Yorker magazine's Joshua Yaffa.
*  Horrifying accounts continue to come from Gaza City, where Israel's raid on Al-Shifa
*  hospital has entered a second week.
*  Israeli forces have killed at least 170 people at the hospital and detained another 400.
*  Survivors of the raid have told Al Jazeera Israeli tanks and armored bulldozers have
*  driven over bodies and ambulances.
*  Israeli forces are also attacking two other hospitals in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, says Israel is now denying
*  access to all UNRWA food convoys to northern Gaza, even though the region is on the brink
*  of famine.
*  On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres traveled to the Raqqa border crossing.
*  A long line of blocked red relief trucks on one side of the gates, the long shadow of
*  starvation on the other.
*  That is more than tragic.
*  It is a moral outrage.
*  Over the weekend, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris warned against Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu invading Raqqa.
*  She spoke to Rachel Scott of ABC News.
*  We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation
*  in Raqqa would be a huge mistake.
*  A mistake, but would there be consequences if he does move forward?
*  Well, we're going to take it one step at a time, but we've been very clear in terms
*  of our perspective on whether or not that should happen.
*  Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States?
*  I am ruling out nothing.
*  This comes as Israel continues to carry out attacks across Gaza, where the death toll
*  has topped 32,200.
*  This is a Palestinian man named Younes Qassab in Raqqa.
*  Israel does not want to cease fire.
*  Instead, it wants to continue exterminating the Palestinian people.
*  This is what Israel and America are planning simultaneously.
*  They do not want to cease fire.
*  Israel seeks genocide against the Palestinian people, and particularly the Gaza Strip.
*  And this is a crime.
*  At the United Nations Security Council, China and Russia Friday vetoed a Gaza ceasefire
*  resolution drafted by the United States.
*  China's ambassador to the U.N., Zhang Jun, criticized the text, because it did not actually
*  demand a ceasefire.
*  The final text remains ambiguous and does not call for an immediate ceasefire, nor does
*  it even provide an answer to the question of realizing a ceasefire in a short time.
*  This is a clear deviation from the consensus of the council members and fell far short
*  of the expectations of the international community.
*  An immediate ceasefire is a fundamental prerequisite for saving lives, expanding humanitarian access
*  and preventing greater conflicts.
*  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, criticized Russia
*  and China for vetoing the resolution.
*  So let's be honest.
*  For all the fiery rhetoric, we all know that Russia and China are not doing anything diplomatically
*  to advance a lasting peace or to meaningfully contribute to the humanitarian response effort.
*  President Biden signed a $1.2 trillion spending package to keep the federal government open
*  until October.
*  The Senate approved the Appropriations Bill 74-24.
*  Independent Senator Bernie Sanders voted no because the bill stripped funding to UNRWA
*  for the next year.
*  Tens of thousands of people are starving.
*  UNRWA is trying to feed them, and the Israeli government and its allies like AIPAC spend
*  much of their time lobbying to defund UNRWA, the major organization which is feeding starving
*  people.
*  Sadly, tragically, many members of Congress seem to be happy to be part of this starvation caucus.
*  In the House, the spending bill was approved 286-134.
*  New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who voted no, accused Israel of committing
*  genocide during a speech on the House floor.
*  If you want to know what an unfolding genocide looks like, open your eyes.
*  It looks like the forced famine of 1.1 million innocents.
*  It looks like thousands of children eating grass as their bodies consume themselves while
*  trucks of food are slowed and halted just miles away.
*  It looks like good and decent people who do nothing.
*  Or too little.
*  Too late.
*  It is against United States law to provide weapons to forces who block United States
*  humanitarian assistance.
*  And that is exactly what is happening right now.
*  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant is in Washington, D.C., for meetings with Defense
*  Secretary Lloyd Austin and others.
*  Axios is reporting Galant is coming with a, quote, long list of U.S. weapons Israel wants
*  to receive in an expedited manner.
*  Protests continued around the world this weekend in Ireland.
*  Tens of thousands marched in Dublin to demand a ceasefire and freedom for Palestinians.
*  In Chile, members of the Palestinian community, which is believed to be the largest Palestinian
*  community outside of the Arab world, gathered with allies to call on President Gabriel Boric
*  to break off all diplomatic relations with Israel.
*  We stand with the oppressed and against the oppressors.
*  We are here to say no more crimes against humanity, so we protest.
*  No more relations with the criminal state of Israel, which insults our nation.
*  Here in New York, hundreds of activists gathered outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art to
*  demand the prestigious museum and its board members cut ties with companies that benefit
*  from Israel's assault on Gaza and commit to helping, quote, preserve Palestinian cultural
*  heritage sites being destroyed by Israel, unquote.
*  Activists displayed a massive 30-by-50-foot quilt on the steps of the Met modeled after
*  the AIDS Memorial Quilt.
*  The Palestine Quilt, pieced together, works by 64 global artists on the theme of, quote,
*  from oppression to liberation, free Palestine, unquote.
*  In Senegal, early results from Sunday's presidential election put the opposition candidate
*  Basidu Diomai Fai in the lead.
*  At least five of the 18 other candidates already conceded to Fai, who's backed by the popular
*  opposition figure Ousmane Sanko, who himself is barred from running.
*  But former Prime Minister Ahmedoubah, who has the backing of outgoing President Macky
*  Saul, said he expects the vote could head to a runoff.
*  A final provisional vote tally is expected Tuesday.
*  Supporters of Sanko and Fai took to the streets to celebrate, nonetheless.
*  I say it's great because it's democracy that's winning.
*  Everyone thought it would never happen.
*  Today, if these results are indeed confirmed, it's Senegal that absolutely wins.
*  Sunday's vote had been rescheduled after President Saul sought to delay the election,
*  leading to large protests and accusations of an attempted power grab.
*  Sanko and Fai were released from prison just days before the election, after Saul granted
*  the men amnesty.
*  Residents of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, are facing rolling blackouts as Russia
*  continues a wave of strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
*  On Sunday, Russia hit an underground oil gas storage site.
*  Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are continuing to attack Russian oil refineries, despite
*  a warning not to do so from the United States.
*  The Financial Times reports the Biden administration fears the attacks inside Russia could drive
*  up oil prices and provoke retaliation.
*  Ukraine also hit two more Russian ships and a communications center used by Russia's
*  Black Sea fleet.
*  In Nigeria, at least 130 kidnapped schoolchildren from the northwestern state of Kaduna were
*  rescued Sunday after more than two weeks in captivity.
*  Previous reports had put the total number of students closer to 300, but officials said
*  the total was actually 137.
*  On Friday, the Nigerian army rescued 17 students kidnapped in the far northwestern Sokoto.
*  At least 1,400 students have been abducted since 2014, with armed groups demanding ransoms
*  for their safer term.
*  In Brazil, police arrested two politicians and Rio de Janeiro's former police chief
*  in a major breakthrough for the investigation into the 2018 assassination of Marielle Franco
*  an outspoken Rio councilwoman and activist.
*  Investigators say brothers Chiquinho, Bourjau and Domingos Bourjau, who also both once served
*  on Rio de Janeiro's city council and remain in official positions, are suspected of masterminding
*  the assassination, which also killed Franco's driver under San Pedro Gomes.
*  Former Rio police chief Rivaldo Barbosa is accused of obstructing investigations into
*  the fatal shooting.
*  Marielle Franco had fought against police brutality and became a voice for other LGBTQ
*  and black Brazilians who face discrimination.
*  Her longtime partner, Mônica Benicio, spoke Sunday following news of the arrests.
*  MÔNICA BENICIO, Mônica Benicio, Brazil Today is, without a doubt, an important day
*  for democracy in Brazil.
*  It is the beginning of a new struggle.
*  We want everyone to be held responsible and everyone to be identified, so that we can
*  finally have justice for Marielle and Anderson.
*  New York Attorney General Letitia James could begin seizing some of former President Donald
*  Trump's assets today if he fails to meet a deadline to post a $454 million bond after
*  losing a civil fraud case in New York.
*  Last week, Trump's attorney said the former president faces, quote, insurmountable difficulties
*  in securing the bond after more than 30 companies refused to help him.
*  Trump's attorneys have appealed the ruling, but a decision is not expected before today's
*  deadline.
*  This comes as Trump appears poised to make as much as $3 billion, as the parent company
*  of his social media platform Truth Social becomes a publicly traded firm following a
*  merger last week.
*  Meanwhile, Trump's expected back in court today in New York for a pretrial hearing
*  in his hush money case.
*  And in news from Capitol Hill, Republican Congressmember Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin
*  has announced he will resign on April 19th.
*  His seat will remain vacant until November.
*  This will cut the House Republican majority to a one-vote margin.
*  In other House news, Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion Friday to remove
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson just five months after he took the office after the ouster
*  of Kevin McCarthy.
*  In other political news, New Jersey First Lady Tammy Murphy has dropped out of the Democratic
*  primary race for Robert Menendez's Senate seat, clearing the way for Congressmember
*  Andy Kim and others in the Democratic primary.
*  Menendez, who is facing multiple corruption charges, has announced he won't run in the
*  Democratic primary, but hasn't ruled out running again as an independent if he's
*  exonerated.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
