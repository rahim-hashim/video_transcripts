*  Affairs, warns Sudan is possibly on course to become the world's worst hunger crisis.

*  MULTIPLE, UNSATELY CLAIMED TO ALARMING LEVELS AND ALREADY CLAIMING CHILDREN'S LIVES.
*  The recent MSF report revealed that one child is dying every two hours in Zamzam camp in
*  al-Fasha, north Dafur.
*  Our humanitarian partners estimate that in the coming weeks and months, somewhere in
*  the region of around 222,000 children could die from malnutrition.
*  In Haiti, armed groups have launched new attacks and blockades in the suburbs near Port-au-Prince,
*  with multiple deaths reported.
*  Haitian police say an operation killed the head of DELMA-95, Ernst Julema, known as Tigre.
*  DELMA-95 is part of Jimmy Charissier's Alliance of Armed Groups.

*  French lawmakers advanced a bill that seeks to rein in fast fashion's impact on the
*  climate, labor rights and the economy.
*  The bill would ban certain ultra-fast fashion companies like Sheehan from advertising and
*  penalize them by up to 10 euros per individual item of clothing.
*  It also would force fast fashion retailers to include information on their products'
*  reuse, repair, recycling and environmental impact next to the product's price.
*  This is French lawmaker, Huguette Tegna.
*  Fighting fast fashion means, first, protecting children living in other countries.
*  It means preserving our biodiversity.
*  It means preserving our French know-how.
*  It means preserving our artisans who work hard day and night in our districts to create
*  clothes that are sustainable and that comply with a minimum of environmental rules.
*  Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine's energy system overnight, killing three people,
*  leaving one million people without power.
*  The attacks triggered a fire at the Dnipro hydroelectric station, cutting off power to

*  the Ukrainian capital.
*  Back in the U.S., the Justice Department has filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against
*  Apple, accusing the tech giant of orchestrating an illegal monopoly in the smartphone industry.
*  U.S. Attorney General Merrick Arlen announced the suit Thursday.
*  Apple carries out its exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct in two principal ways.
*  First, Apple imposes contractual restrictions and fees that limit the features and functionality
*  that developers can offer iPhone users.
*  Second, Apple selectively restricts access to the points of connection between third-party
*  apps and the iPhone's operating system, degrading the functionality of non-Apple apps and accessories.
*  As a result, for most of the past 15 years, Apple has collected a tax in the form of a
*  30% commission on the price of any app downloaded from the App Store, as well as on in-app purchases.
*  In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed a new law banning unhoused people from
*  sleeping in public places, such as parks and sidewalks.
*  The law requires counties to establish temporary campsites if shelters are at maximum capacity.
*  Under the law, individuals can sue a jurisdiction if they see people living on the streets.
*  Housing advocates and other critics say the law does not effectively address the housing
*  crisis or provide necessary funding, and further marginalizes the already vulnerable unhoused population.
*  Here in New York, home health aides are on a five-day hunger strike calling on the city
*  to pass the No More 24 Act to put an end to 24-hour workdays.
*  The majority of home health workers are women of color and immigrant women.
*  Guihua Song, from the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, said, quote, working 24 hours
*  a day for a long time, our bodies have been tortured, broken down and full of aches and
*  pains.
*  We cannot care for our children and families.
*  Many of our sisters' health is destroyed, and they, too, have become patients, they
*  said.
*  In more labor news, Georgia Republicans passed a bill that penalizes union-friendly employers.
*  The legislation would bar workplaces that voluntarily recognize unions from receiving
*  state subsidies.
*  And Governor Brian Kemp backs the law, but it's expected to face tough legal challenges.
*  The president of the AFL-CIO Liz Schuller called the measure appalling, adding that
*  it, quote, violates long-held precedent established by the National Labor Relations Board Act.
*  And Senator Bernie Sanders and Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reintroduced the
*  Green New Deal for Public Housing Act this week to address the dual crises of climate
*  change and unaffordable housing.
*  This is AOC.
*  The Green New Deal for Public Housing would immediately replenish the multi-billion-dollar
*  backlog for public housing repairs.
*  It would repeal the Faircloth Amendment.
*  It would invest up to $234 billion over 10 years to preserve, upgrade and expand our
*  public housing stock.
*  It would bring public housing down to zero carbon emissions while creating 280,000 jobs
*  in America.
*  It would end the era of government neglect, demolition and privatization of our public
*  housing stock.
*  This bill also addresses unsustainable rent prices.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
