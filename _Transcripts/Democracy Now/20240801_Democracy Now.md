We look at a new Washington Post investigation titled “Money War” that traces the effects of U.S. sanctions under the last four presidents: Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden. According to the report, the U.S government has instituted, in some form or another, sanctions against a third of all other countries around the world, despite no clear evidence that they are effective in influencing target nations’ politics, and in fact may often entrench the power of ruling parties. We speak to Jeff Stein, one of the authors of the Post investigation, about the findings, including on the effects of sanctions in Venezuela and Iran.

# Money War How the U.S. Unleashed Economic Warfare Across the Globe, from Venezuela to Iran
**Democracy Now:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuIqg27RMT0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
*  We end today's show looking at a major new Washington Post exposé titled Money War,
*  How Four U.S. Presidents Unleashed Economic Warfare Across the Globe.
*  The Post's reporting examines how the U.S. has increasingly relied on economic sanctions
*  that have left collateral damage across the globe.
*  The Post exposé begins saying, quote,
*  Today, the United States imposes three times as many sanctions as any other country or
*  international body, targeting a third of all nations with some kind of financial penalty
*  on people, properties or organizations.
*  But the collateral damage of the sanctions is seldom discussed.
*  The Washington Post reports in Venezuela, which just held a contested election, sanctions
*  have contributed to an economic contraction roughly three times as large as that caused
*  by the Great Depression in the United States.
*  The Post also reports Donald Trump was warned sanctions on Venezuela could result in millions
*  of people migrating from Venezuela.
*  We're joined now by Jeff Stein, co-author of the Washington Post exposé and White House
*  economics reporter for The Post.
*  Why don't you take it from there, Jeff?
*  In this five minutes that we have together, talk about making the Venezuelan economy
*  scream.
*  We'll go from the effect of sanctions on Venezuela and then go to other countries.
*  Yeah, so starting under the Obama administration, the U.S. began imposing sanctions on Venezuela.
*  But at first, they were very limited.
*  They were really just focused on a few members of the Maduro regime that were responsible
*  for carrying out violent reprisals against protesters in Venezuela.
*  But really under Trump, and as we exclusively reported in this story, despite the warnings
*  of DHS officials and classified reports about the potential outmigration effects of these
*  sanctions, the Trump administration really choked off the main source of export revenue.
*  96% of Venezuela's export revenue comes from oil sales.
*  And what the U.S. effectively did over the course of three to four years was to block
*  those sales from occurring in international markets.
*  And that really strangled the joint ventures that were sort of the lifeblood of the Venezuelan
*  economy.
*  And so, the oil deals that were worked out with U.S. producers, with the Venezuelans,
*  that were providing them with the revenue that they needed to buy sort of imports from
*  other countries.
*  And when that happened, you saw the numbers are just staggering.
*  71% economic contraction in Venezuela, as you mentioned, three times as great as the
*  U.S. Great Depression and greater than any other peacetime economic collapse recorded
*  in modern history, greater than many other economic collapses of countries at war, including
*  Ukraine after the Russian invasion or Iraq after the U.S. invasion in 2003.
*  So this is a cataclysmic event.
*  And economists go back and forth, and it seems clear to me from my reporting that the economic
*  collapse in Venezuela predates U.S. sanctions.
*  Venezuela had inflation of over 800% before Trump really tightened the screws on the Venezuelan
*  economy.
*  But there is also no doubt that these U.S. measures made the economic situation in Venezuela
*  worse and at the cost of—and, well, despite that cost, did not push out Maduro's government,
*  who—and obviously Maduro still remains in power today.
*  So, can you say, Jeff—I mean, this is Venezuela's case, but also elsewhere, how effective have
*  U.S. economic sanctions been?
*  I mean, there was a time, which you point out in the piece, with apartheid South Africa,
*  which the U.S. government helped bring down and apartheid, also in Serbia, the demise
*  of Milošević's regime, also through sanctions or partially through sanctions.
*  But what about now?
*  Now, I think it's really hard to say.
*  Academic attempts to sort of isolate the effects of sanctions and whether they have worked
*  or not are very hard to quantify.
*  Some studies I've seen suggest that the success rate is between 15 and 30 percent,
*  which, given that we have sanctions now in some form on roughly a third of all nations
*  and 60 percent of all poor countries, suggests a very high failure rate.
*  We look in the piece at Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Syria.
*  These are tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people who are being affected
*  in some form by U.S. sanctions, where the regimes that the U.S. are intending to target
*  have not changed hands, have not surrendered their hold on power.
*  And maybe, you know, the U.S. will say that these sanctions are still better than not
*  having any measures because they deprive these regimes of funds at their disposal that they
*  can use for, you know, what the U.S. would say are pernicious activities, activities
*  that the U.S. does not want to see.
*  But at the same time, in terms of actually leading to changes of regime, we don't really
*  see that very much.
*  And many critics will argue that, in fact, sanctions actually embolden and empower the
*  people in charge, these regimes in charge, because they curb civil society, they reduce
*  the power and the clout of private sector actors that often form a rival power base
*  to the sanctioning, sanctioned authority that these regimes in charge.
*  And so, in case after case, we see very legitimate, it seems, criticisms of these sanctions regimes.
*  And what about Iran, to say the least, very much in the news today, the effect of the
*  U.S. sanctions and also how, when the U.S. imposes sanctions, they also pressure other
*  countries to do the same, of course, as we see in Cuba?
*  Yeah, the Iran sanctions really first imposed in really dramatic effect in 2010 through
*  measures passed by the Obama administration and Congress really amounted to a fascinating
*  expansion of U.S. sanction authority, where we really saw, in a very significant way,
*  the first deployment of secondary sanctions, which were to say, we're not just sanctioning
*  the party that we don't like here, but we're also going to say, if you engage with measure
*  in trade with the Iranian regime, we will target you.
*  And so that effectively represented a major expansion of sanctioning power and really
*  to the advocates of sanctions to be a very effective approach, because obviously in 2015,
*  the Obama administration worked with the Iranian regime on a nuclear deal that sanctions advocates
*  hailed as the product of this pressure campaign.
*  That said, the U.S. under Trump, you know, pulled out of that deal, and so any people
*  who say that the Iranian sanctions under Obama were successful have to contend with the fact
*  that we abandoned as a country that deal quite quickly and left the Iranians in the lurch
*  and have since then seen the Iranians work with Russia, work with, you know, the Cubans,
*  work with other powers that the U.S. is opposed to on forming rival financial networks that
*  leave open the question of whether there's even the possibility of further Iran sanctions
*  being effective now that they've formed all these rival sort of trading networks that
*  operate sort of as a shadow trade system to what the U.S., the sort of Western financial
*  system, is the predicate for punishing Iran via sanctions.
*  And Jeff, very quickly, we have 30 seconds.
*  What happened to the 2021 plan to overhaul the U.S. sanctions system?
*  Yeah, we exclusively report in our story that a group of Treasury staffers had a draft of
*  a report far more extensive than what they ultimately released.
*  They had dozens of recommendations, including measures really meant to check the rise of
*  U.S. sanctions, particularly a sort of central coordinator.
*  Right now, it's a little bureaucratic, but there are sort of many parts of the government
*  that sort of throw out sanctions ideas.
*  They get rolled together in State Department and Treasury Department sanctions and push
*  forward.
*  And there's really no one body that sort of is evaluating whether these sanctions are
*  operating in the context of an overall broader sanctions strategy.
*  And Treasury staffers drew up a plan to say, like, let's put that in place.
*  But disagreements with the State Department, sort of the overall inertia of sanctions,
*  where they seem so easy, so effective, they seem to the U.S. government much easier than
*  going to war, much easier than doing nothing, and much more politically palatable than doing
*  nothing.
*  And so that plan was shelved.
*  And really, under the Biden administration, we've just seen more and more sanctions.
*  Biden has imposed 6,000 sanctions in two years, an unprecedented sum.
*  And the fact that that has continued really reflects the inability of the U.S. to get
*  this problem or to get this number down.
