**Democracy Now!:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhntdp0x8Qw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Former President Donald Trump won the Republican primary in New Hampshire, defeating former
*  South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who once served as Trump's U.N. ambassador.
*  Trump won by about 11 percentage points.
*  He got 54.5 percent of the vote.
*  Haley received about 43 percent.
*  On Tuesday night, Nikki Haley vowed to stay in the race.
*  Well, I have news for all of them.
*  New Hampshire is first in the nation.
*  It is not the last in the nation.
*  This race is far from over.
*  During his victory speech, Donald Trump stood alongside two of his former rivals, South
*  Carolina Senators Tim Scott and Vivek Rameswamy.
*  Trump called Haley an imposter and falsely claimed he'd won the general election in
*  New Hampshire twice before, even though he lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to Joe
*  Biden in 2020.
*  This is a great, great state.
*  You know, we won New Hampshire three times now, three.
*  We won it every time.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.

*  We won the primary.
*  We won the primary.
*  We won the generals.
*  We've won it.
*  And it's a very, very special place to me.
*  It's very important.
*  With his victory on Tuesday, Trump becomes the first non-incumbent Republican candidate
*  to win both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary in the modern era as he moves closer
*  to a rematch with President Joe Biden in November.
*  Biden wasn't on the ballot in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, but he still won the state
*  as a write-in candidate.
*  Biden didn't run in the primary after New Hampshire refused a request by the Democratic
*  National Committee to move its primary until after South Carolina's.
*  Biden's final vote count is still being tallied.
*  Congressmember Dean Phillips placed second with about 20 percent of the vote.
*  Marianne Williamson placed third with about 5 percent.
*  You can see our interview with her at democracynow.org.
*  We'll have more on the primary.
*  We'll be going to New Hampshire after headlines.
*  Israel has killed at least 210 Palestinians in Gaza over the past 24 hours as it intensifies
*  its bombardment of the city of Chanyunas.
*  Israel has issued new evacuation orders to over 500,000 Palestinians in Chanyunas, where
*  many had sought refuge from Israel's attacks in the northern Gaza Strip.
*  On Tuesday, at least six Palestinians died when a missile hit one of the U.N.'s largest
*  shelters in Chanyunas.
*  The British news outlet ITV filmed Israeli forces fatally shooting a Palestinian man
*  in Gaza shortly after he gave an interview about trying to help others evacuate to a
*  safe area.
*  The shocking footage shows Ramzi Abu Salul shot as he stood with several other men, one
*  carrying a white flag.
*  This is part of ITV's report, beginning with the words of Ramzi Abu Salul.
*  The Israelis came to us and told us to evacuate, but they didn't let my brother out.
*  We wanted to go and try to get them, God willing.
*  The interview complete.
*  Our cameraman walked away.
*  And then, this happened.
*  The interviewee had been shot and fatally wounded.
*  You can see them place their flag on his chest.
*  As he was carried away, the white flag was turning red.
*  At the United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres reiterated his call for a Gaza ceasefire.
*  The entire population of Gaza is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without
*  parallel in recent history.
*  Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
*  The U.N. Secretary General went on to criticize statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders opposing a two-state solution.
*  Last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution at the highest level
*  of the Israeli government is unacceptable.
*  This refusal and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people would indefinitely
*  prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security.
*  Guterres' comments came as The Wall Street Journal reports a group of five Arab countries
*  have proposed a plan to end the war in Gaza and create a pathway toward a Palestinian
*  state.
*  As part of the deal, Saudi Arabia would also recognize the state of Israel.
*  Israel's revealed more details about how 21 Israeli soldiers died in a single incident
*  in Gaza Monday.
*  The IDF says the reservists were planting explosive mines to blow up two buildings in
*  eastern Gaza.
*  During a firefight, Hamas militants hit one of the mines, setting off a chain reaction
*  that toppled the buildings with Israeli troops trapped inside.
*  Israel says the buildings were being leveled to create a so-called buffer zone in eastern
*  Gaza.
*  The Intercept reports this appears to be the first time the Israeli military has publicly
*  admitted that it's systematically destroying whole areas of Gaza with the intent of depopulating
*  the area.
*  President Biden traveled to Virginia Tuesday for a campaign rally focused on abortion rights.
*  Biden's speech was interrupted at least 13 times by protesters calling for him to
*  support a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  One protester screamed out, Genocide Joe, how many kids have you killed today?
*  The New York Police Department has launched an investigation after pro-Palestinian students
*  at Columbia University were sprayed on Friday with a hazardous foul-smelling chemical during
*  a campus protest.
*  Eight students were hospitalized.
*  The group Students for Justice in Palestine has alleged the chemical attack was carried
*  out by two students who are former members of the Israeli military.
*  No arrests have yet been made.
*  The U.S. military has carried out strikes inside both Yemen and Iraq as fears of a regional
*  war in the Middle East grow.
*  In Iraq, the U.S. hit three sites connected to a militia with ties to Iran.
*  Iraq's national security adviser Qassem al-Araji condemned the attack, saying, quote,
*  the U.S. should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than
*  targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body, unquote.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. bombed Yemen again earlier today, targeting what officials described
*  as Houthi anti-ship missiles.
*  Press comes as Houthi forces continue to target commercial ships in the Red Sea and
*  the Gulf of Aden as part of a campaign to pressure Israel to halt its assault on Gaza.
*  A Russian transport plane reportedly carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war has crashed
*  in Russia's Belgarod region near Ukraine.
*  According to Russian media, all 74 people on board died.
*  Russia's foreign ministry has accused Ukraine of downing the military plane but provided
*  no evidence.
*  Ukraine said it's investigating what happened and has accused Russia of, quote, carrying
*  out special information operations directed against Ukraine.
*  The crash comes a day after at least 18 Ukrainians were killed and 130 were injured as Russia
*  fired a barrage of missiles at several cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv.
*  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 130 residential buildings were struck in the attacks Tuesday.
*  In other news from Europe, Sweden's now a step closer to joining the NATO military
*  alliance.
*  On Tuesday, the Turkish parliament voted to finally approve Sweden's membership.
*  This leaves Hungary as the only country remaining that needs to approve Sweden's accession.
*  This comes as 90,000 troops from the United States and other NATO nations are preparing
*  to take part in NATO's largest military drills since the Cold War.
*  The Bolton of the Atomic Scientists is warning the world remains as close to global annihilation
*  as ever before.
*  The Bolton has announced its doomsday clock remains at 90 seconds before midnight, where
*  it was first set for the first time last year.
*  Princeton University professor Alex Glazer spoke Tuesday.
*  When we set the clock last year, there were major concerns that nuclear weapons could
*  be used in Ukraine.
*  And today's clock setting was still overshadowed by the war in Ukraine, but also the war in
*  Gaza, which has caused enormous human suffering and could lead to a broader conflict in the
*  region involving several nuclear weapon states and regional powers.
*  A U.S. federal appeals court revived a $10 billion lawsuit filed by the Mexican government
*  against U.S. gunmakers.
*  In 2021, Mexico sued six gun manufacturers, including Glock and Smith & Wesson, for aiding
*  and abetting the unlawful transfer of hundreds of thousands of guns annually into Mexico,
*  helping to fuel drug cartel violence.
*  Mexico estimates 70 percent of the guns trafficked into Mexico come from the United States.
*  In related news, Mexico is calling on the Biden administration to investigate how drug
*  cartels are increasingly obtaining U.S. military-grade weapons, including rocket launchers, grenades
*  and belt-fed machine guns.
*  The Los Angeles Times has laid off about 115 journalists, slashing the size of its newsroom
*  by 20 percent.
*  Many of those who lost their jobs were journalists of color, including Jean Guerrero, who was
*  the only Latina columnist for the opinion desk.
*  The paper also laid off its only reporters who focus on covering black and Asian communities
*  in Southern California.
*  The layoffs are the largest at the L.A. Times since billionaire Patrick Tsuen Chieng bought
*  the paper in 2018.
*  In other media news, Time magazine laid off 30 journalists, that's 15 percent of its
*  unionized editorial staff.
*  Meanwhile, The Baltimore Sun is in a state of turmoil after it was recently purchased
*  by David Smith, the chair of the right-wing news network Sinclair.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
