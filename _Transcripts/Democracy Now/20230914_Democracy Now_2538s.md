# Naomi Klein on Her New Book "Doppelganger" & How Conspiracy Culture Benefits Ruling Elite
**Democracy Now!:** [September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWrHd-izFg)
*  Today, we make a trip into the mirror world.
*  The acclaimed writer Naomi Klein has a new book out this week that delves deeply into
*  the culture of conspiracy theories and a growing alliance between the far right and people
*  who once identified as progressive.
*  The book comes as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. campaigns against Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination
*  for president.
*  Kennedy, who was once a prominent environmental lawyer, is now a leading figure in the anti-vaccine
*  movement.
*  In July, Kennedy made headlines after claiming, quote, COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians
*  and black people.
*  He went on to say Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese are most immune to COVID.
*  One notable defender of Kennedy's claims was the writer Naomi Wolf, who's best known
*  for her 1991 book, The Beauty Myth.
*  In a sub-stack post, Wolf defended Kennedy, writing, quote, R.F.K.
*  Jr. is cursed and blessed with a passion for actual truth, she wrote.
*  Kennedy and Wolf have both been embraced by the far right.
*  Republican mega-donors are helping to bankroll Kennedy's long-shot presidential campaign,
*  while Wolf is now a regular guest on Steve Bannon's podcast, The War Room, where she
*  spreads conspiracy theories about COVID vaccines and other issues.
*  Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has also praised Naomi Wolf, saying she is, quote,
*  one of the bravest, clearest-thinking people I know.
*  Well, Naomi Wolf plays a central role in Naomi Klein's new book, titled Doppelganger,
*  A Trip into the Mirror World.
*  Klein examines how and why more and more people started confusing her with Wolf, as Naomi
*  Wolf fell deeper into what Naomi Klein called the mirror world, where facts no longer matter.
*  Naomi Klein writes in the book, quote, the trouble with the mirror world, there is always
*  some truth mixed in with the lies, always some devastating collective failure it's
*  identified and is opportunistically exploiting, unquote.
*  In a moment, Naomi Klein will join us live, but first we play a short video produced along
*  with the book.
*  Hi, I'm Naomi Klein, and as some of you know, I have a doppelganger, a person who does many
*  extreme things that cause strangers to chastise me or thank me or express their pity for me.
*  I used to be horrified by this, but then something happened that I didn't expect.
*  I got interested, interested in what it means to have a doppelganger.
*  So I decided to follow my doppelganger to a place I've come to think of as the mirror
*  world.
*  It's a strange mirror image of the world where I live.
*  It's a place where many ideas that I care about are being twisted and warped into dangerous
*  doppelganger versions of themselves.
*  When I look at the mirror world, I don't see disagreements over a shared reality.
*  I see disagreements about what is real and what is a simulation.
*  And with AI generating more and more of what we see and hear, it's only getting harder
*  to distinguish the authentic from the synthetic.
*  After all, artificial intelligence is a mirroring and mimicry machine.
*  We feed in the cumulative words, ideas and images that our species has managed to create,
*  and these programs mirror back to us something that feels uncannily life-like.
*  But it's not life.
*  It's a forgery of life.
*  I shadowed my doppel further into the mirror world, a place where soft-focused wellness
*  influencers make common cause with fire-breathing far-right propagandists, all in the name of
*  saving and protecting the children.
*  Not everyone is dogged by their doppelganger, but our culture is crowded with all kinds
*  of doubling.
*  All of us who maintain a persona or avatar online are kind of creating our own doppelgangers.
*  Forging a separate public identity that is both us and not us.
*  A doppelganger, we perform for one another as the price of admission in a rapacious
*  attention economy.
*  And all the while, tech companies create digital profiles of us without our full knowledge.
*  Data doubles or golems that follow us everywhere we go online, carrying their own agenda,
*  their own logics and their own threats.
*  What is all of this doubling and doppelganging doing to us?
*  How is it steering what we pay attention to?
*  And more critically, what we neglect and ignore?
*  Doppelgangers are often understood as a warning or an omen, a message that something needs
*  our attention.
*  Reality is doubling, multiplying, glitching, telling us to pay attention.
*  Because it's not just individuals who can flip into a sinister version of themselves.
*  The earth can transform into a menacing, uncanny twin of what we once knew.
*  Whole societies can flip.
*  That's the reason many doppelganger works of art are ultimately about the latent potential
*  for fascism within our societies, even within ourselves.
*  What I've learned by shadowing my double is that the forces that have destabilized
*  my personal world are part of a much larger web of forces that are destabilizing our shared
*  world.
*  And understanding these forces may be our best hope of getting to firmer ground.
*  Naomi Klein is an award-winning author and journalist.
*  She's professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia,
*  founding co-director of the UBC Center for Climate Justice.
*  Her previous books include On Fire, The Burning Case for a Green New Deal,
*  The Shock Doctrine, The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.
*  This changes everything, capitalism versus the climate.
*  No Logo, Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies.
*  Naomi is also a columnist for The Guardian.
*  She's joining us now from Washington, D.C., as she begins her book tour around the country.
*  Naomi, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  It's great to have you with us.
*  Thank you.
*  And congratulations on the—
*  Thank you so much, Amy.
*  On the publication of this book.
*  I like what the great artist and author Molly Kravapal said about your book,
*  a dazzling, hallucinatory tour de force that takes the reader through shadow selves and
*  global fascism, leaving them gasping by the end.
*  So, Naomi, if you can explain more, this journey you took through the pandemic
*  into this mirror world, who your doppelganger is, and then go back to 2011 and that moment
*  in the Lou where you talk about—hearing women talk about you?
*  Or was it Naomi Wolf?
*  Take it from there.
*  All right.
*  Well, first of all, Amy and Nermeen, thank you so much for having me back on the show.
*  It's such a pleasure to be with you.
*  And thank you for airing that video.
*  I just want to credit the director Colby Richardson, who's an amazing video artist.
*  So those of you who are listening just to the audio, I really encourage you to watch the video
*  version because it gets really trippy.
*  Amy, you listed some of my previous books in that lovely introduction.
*  My books, Back to No Logo, my first book, which I wrote on the cusp of the new millennium almost
*  a quarter of a century ago, have been attempts to map our political moment.
*  They've been attempts to make sense of moments of big shifts in our political world,
*  our cultural world, and in the case of This Changes Everything, our physical world.
*  And I would say that Doppelganger is an attempt to make a usable map of our moment.
*  The thing is, our moment is a lot weirder and wilder than any I've ever lived through.
*  There are all kinds of strange happenings at work, all kinds of uncanny events.
*  So I thought in many ways that I needed to write in a different way, a way that sort of mirrored
*  the wildness of now. And so, you know, I let myself have more fun with the writing.
*  I wanted to re-find a voice that felt more like me, that felt more like the person who
*  talks to their friends, that was more conversational.
*  But also, Amy, you know, this project began during the pandemic, and I've written about
*  large-scale collective shocks. That's what the Shock Doctrine was about. But I realized that in
*  the past, you know, if I was covering Hurricane Katrina or the U.S. and U.K. invasion and
*  occupation of Iraq or the Asian tsunami, I mean, these huge cataclysmic events, I was, you know,
*  I think as you are, right, the journalist who comes in with a notepad, maybe a camera,
*  and I'm interviewing other people about their shock. But really, I've had a reportorial
*  distance. COVID was different. Nobody was outside of that shock. It upended my world as it upended
*  all of our worlds. And in many ways, the world became uncanny and unfamiliar. Freud described
*  the uncanny as that species of frightening in which that which was familiar becomes strange.
*  Think about Times Square during the pandemic. That is an uncanny apparition. It's something
*  familiar that looks completely different. It's empty, one of the busiest places on Earth.
*  But I think there are many kinds of uncanny experiences that we have
*  of in the world today. You know, I now live in British Columbia. We had an extreme weather
*  event a couple of years ago called a heat dome, and hundreds of people died. Millions of marine
*  creatures died. But what was most uncanny about the heat dome is it was not our weather. It was
*  like somebody else's weather coming to a temperate rainforest. And so I thought by using the
*  uncanniness of having a doppelganger, you asked about my doppelganger, I am perennially confused
*  and conflated with another writer named Naomi Wolf, named Naomi, Naomi Wolf. And, you know, having
*  having that identity confusion is an extreme form of uncanniness because what becomes unfamiliar is
*  you. You see people and hear people talking about you, but it's not you. It's very destabilizing.
*  So I thought, well, this is an interesting technique. And she really is less the subject
*  of the book than a literary technique to get into these other kinds of uncanny forces.
*  Should I tell the bathroom story? Please. You really want me to do it? Yeah. So the first
*  chapter begins telling the story where actually I was I was in New York City
*  to be part of Occupy Wall Street. I was I was at a march through the financial district
*  at the height of Occupy Wall Street. And like other people at that march, I needed to use a public
*  restroom. And I was I was in one of these, you know, skyscrapers. And and I don't remember exactly
*  which building. But while in the restroom, I overheard a couple of people talking about me
*  being quite unkind. I must say, I mean, they were they were saying they were they were sort of
*  drawing like, did you read that article by Naomi Klein? Oh, my God, she really doesn't understand
*  our movement. She doesn't understand our demands. And I was sort of frozen in fear, but brought back
*  all of all of my terrible high school memories. You know, these these mean girls were were talking
*  about me. But as I listened, I realized, oh, they're not talking about me. They're talking
*  about somebody else. So I came out of the stall and I met one of their eyes and I said
*  words that I have had to say, unfortunately, too many times. I think you're talking about Naomi Wolf.
*  But in the end, that became quite fitting to me because, you know, I think when we overhear
*  people speaking about us on social media, we essentially are just reading the graffiti on the
*  on the bathroom wall, which is not healthy. And we probably should stop doing that. So I think
*  it's fitting that the first time I became aware of the identity confusion in the real world,
*  it was it was actually literally in a bathroom. And we may let just say that this weekend is the
*  12th anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. Naomi, I think going on for some time.
*  Naomi, I'd like to just join Amy in congratulating you on this book. I mean, I know that I'm not
*  alone in thinking this, that when I read it, I realized that it's actually the book that needed
*  to be written. I mean, it's it's amazing the way you're simultaneously disclosive, funny,
*  subtle and so insightful about our present historical moment. So I want to ask about the
*  reasons that you it's the doppelganger effect that you identify is, of course, not just with
*  Naomi Wolf. Naomi Wolf is almost like incidental to what you come to identify, which is that you
*  recognize in seeing your doppelganger that you were also seeing, quote, in your words,
*  a magnification of many undesirable aspects of our shared culture. So could you just enumerate
*  or list what those undesirable aspects are of which I mean, you can select some because they're
*  so numerous. Yeah, absolutely. You know, it definitely wouldn't have been worth doing this
*  if it if it wasn't kind of a narrow aperture to, you know, use a film image that would allow us to
*  see much larger forces at work. And I think we all know people who have changed dramatically in the
*  past few years, you know, who don't really seem like themselves. You know, I think it's less
*  interesting that Naomi Wolf is a seemingly a doppelganger for me for a lot of to a lot of
*  people's eyes than that she seems to be a doppelganger of her former self, right, that she was
*  a prominent feminist. She was involved in progressive movements. And now here she is
*  on Steve Bannon's podcast, in some cases, every single day, like there have been
*  weeks where she has been a guest every single day that he has been broadcasting.
*  I think probably Democracy Now! listeners would be surprised to learn that they published a book
*  together. They put out t shirts together. So you know, her role on Steve in Steve Bannon's
*  media sphere is almost like a co host more than a guest. She's a really important figure in this
*  world. But part of the reason we don't know this has to do with this, what I call the mirror world
*  and the fact that while they see us, we have chosen for the most part not to see them.
*  And I think that that's very dangerous, because these are really important political movements.
*  Steve Bannon is a is a very able political strategist. He got Donald Trump elected once,
*  and he fully intends to do it again. And part of Steve Bannon strategy is that he is very good
*  at looking at issues and people who have been abandoned by the Democratic Party, or even by the
*  left, people who have been mistreated, ejected, and saying, Come on over to this side, come on
*  over to this side of the glass, and we'll take a little bit of truth, you know, you use that quote
*  that that there's always a little bit of truth mixed in, and we'll mix it up with all of these
*  dangerous lies. But to me, as a lifelong leftist, what concerns me about that is that many of the
*  issues that they are co opting and twisting are issues that I think the left should be more vocal
*  about. You know, I had one of my most, you know, I'd say like a moment in the research where I was
*  listening to hundreds of hours of Bannon's podcast, where I would say I felt most destabilized,
*  was when I would hear Bannon cut together a montage, an audio montage and a video montage
*  of intros and outros of major cable news shows on CNN and MSNBC, brought to you by Pfizer,
*  brought to you by Moderna. And you know, his point was to say, you can't trust these corporate media
*  outlets because they are bought and paid for by the drug companies that are trying to get you
*  vaccinated, right. But for me, what was what was chilling about that was that that was a doppelganger
*  of the kind of media education that I grew up in, you know, we all read manufacturing consent,
*  we had these charts where we and I mean, Amy, they sounded a little bit like you, they sounded like
*  me, they sounded like Noam Chomsky, except through a warped mirror. And what worried me about that is
*  really reminded me that I don't think we're doing that kind of, of systems based media education
*  anymore, where we really are looking at these ownership structures. And if that doesn't happen,
*  then it's going to be co opted in the mirror world. So, you know, I guess, I mean, thank you
*  for your kind words about the book. I'm so glad that it resonated with you. It was a sort of risk.
*  But I think maybe by being specific, you know, we're all thinking about the people in our lives and
*  this phenomenon that's that's affected us all. I think when I look at people who have made this
*  a similar political migration from from liberalism or leftism over to the ban and ask right,
*  I think we often see some economic forces at work. Naomi Wolf has has quadrupled her following
*  because of this this decision, this political decision of hers. She's not the only one,
*  you know, I'm sure people are thinking of other people. It's actually a really smart business move.
*  And, and this is happening within an economic system that has monetized detention.
*  You know, people are trying to build their personal brands because they've been told that
*  they're not going to get a job that this is the only way they can survive in these roiling
*  capitalist seas. And there there are a lot of there's a lot of clicks over there. So I think
*  that's some of it. You know, what are the other forces that get magnified? Well, you know, this
*  is a little tricky to say because you know, I do write, you know, this I don't think this gives
*  people a pass. But but Wolf is one of these people who has experienced a lot of of shaming
*  and kind of pylons on on left Twitter, liberal Twitter, or X or whatever it's called.
*  She's really been I would say internet bullied. People can say, Okay, well, for good reason,
*  she's made all of she's she's spread conspiracies. She's made major factual errors in her book.
*  But I don't think that's necessarily a justification for for cruelty. So I think
*  that's something else that gets magnified. Because I think when people have an experience
*  that is very, very negative in left or liberal circles, where they really get treated almost like
*  they're, they're, they're, they're not human. And that's partly because they're performing
*  themselves as a brand, which is saying, you know, hey, I'm out here, I'm a commodity, I'm a thing.
*  And then people start thinking, well, if you're a thing, I can throw things at you and you won't
*  bleed. You know, I think that that's part of what is magnified here. And that becomes a justification
*  for I think, an unjustifiable political alliance with extremely dangerous figures who are building
*  a network of far right political parties who take issues like rightful suspicion of big pharma,
*  rightful anger at big tech, rightful anger at the elites and flip it to transphobia,
*  xenophobia, racism, you know, and here I'm thinking about figures like Georgia Maloney,
*  who is, you know, a protege of Steve Bannon's. And Naomi, I mean, if you could if you could
*  elaborate on that point, I mean, one of the failures that you identify is, for instance,
*  the Democratic Party or progressives generally not focusing on making, for instance,
*  different social media platforms more equitable, more democratic, but rather, you know, when people
*  are deplatformed, including Naomi Wolf, kind of celebrating their removal. And you say that
*  believing that once they're deplatformed, they've effectively disappeared is the equivalent
*  of saying that children, children who think that once they close their eyes,
*  the world has disappeared. If you could elaborate on that.
*  Yeah, so I mean, like when I would when I would confess to people, I knew that I was working on
*  this book, sometimes I would get the strange reaction like, well, why would you give her
*  attention? And there was this sense that because she was no longer visible in the pages of the New
*  York Times or on, you know, MSNBC or wherever, and because she had been deplatformed on on social
*  media, that or on the social media that we're on, that she just didn't exist. And there was this
*  assumption that we whoever we are, are are in control of the attention. And so if if if if the
*  spigot gets turned off, then there's no more attention. But because I was following this,
*  what I was seeing was that she had a much, much larger platform than probably she'd had since
*  her star rose in the 1990s. And she was advising Al Gore on his presidential run in 2000. You know,
*  what Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon can offer her is more than what a lot of liberal media outlets
*  can offer. And she's been on a Jordan Peterson's podcast. And she's also in these, you know, I call
*  it the mirror world because there's kind of a one to one replica of many of the the social media
*  platforms, the crowdfunding platforms. So she was kicked off Twitter. She immediately got an account
*  on on getter and and getter they call themselves the Twitter killer. So I think it is really,
*  really reckless to ignore this world because, you know, it's not like they're just, you know,
*  it's not like it's a hobby what they're doing there. As Steve Bannon says, the goal is to take
*  power for the next hundred years. So not paying attention to this and not looking at what issues
*  are getting traction there, I think is really reckless. In 2016, Steve Bannon successfully
*  peeled away a portion of the Democratic Party base who had voted for Democrat after Democrat who
*  promised them that they were going to renegotiate or cancel free trade deals that had gutted their
*  communities and offshore jobs. And they didn't do it. Many of them signed more free trade deals.
*  And Steve Bannon saw an opportunity. You know, I don't think it's about whether or not he
*  personally believes this is, you know, an important issue or whether Trump did anything really
*  meaningful in this regard. The issue is they picked up an issue that their opponents had
*  abandoned and used it to political effect. And that is now happening with opposition to big tech,
*  opposition to big pharma, even standing up for free speech. Right. And so I think that there
*  needs to be, you know, and it's wildly hypocritical because they're the same people who are banning
*  books. But to me, like, we can't control them. We can't control ourselves and whether or not
*  we are doing a good enough job embodying our own principles. And, you know, I think one of the
*  things that happened during the pandemic is that the more misinformation was being spread by the
*  likes of Wolf and Bannon, the more people who see themselves as progressive started just getting
*  into a reactive position where we're just defending the CDC. We're just defending what the government
*  is saying. When in fact, the role of the left is to push for much more. Right. Sure. Yes, get
*  vaccinated, wear a mask. But what about fighting for the right to indoor air quality for everybody?
*  What about demanding that schools have smaller classrooms, more outdoor education, more teacher,
*  giving essential workers the raises instead of just the applause, the right to, I mean, there's,
*  you know, or lifting the patents on the vaccines. And I know you covered this on Democracy Now
*  consistently, but I think if we're honest, it was the right that organized during the pandemic. You
*  know, I live in Canada now. I'm back in Canada and we had the trucker convoy that shut down Ottawa
*  for three weeks. And, you know, I'm not going to get into much about the trucker convoy, except to
*  say that my, you know, one of the things that occurred to me is, you know, what had happened,
*  what would have happened if there was a robust left that had shut down cities and demanded that
*  before we got our fourth booster, everybody on this planet got their first COVID vaccine,
*  you know, or made any of these other collective demands about truly funding public health care,
*  universal public health care would have been a good response to the pandemic. So, you know,
*  I think we have to be a lot more ambitious and a lot less reactive to just what they're doing,
*  quote unquote, they. Naomi, very quickly, before we break, we just have a minute. If you could
*  explain, you mentioned the truck convoy, you mentioned two truck convoys. What do you think,
*  principally, why was that so important? What was misrepresented?
*  Oh, that's a little maybe it's a little bit tricky to explain quickly. But,
*  seven months before the famous trucker convoy, the one that made it on all the US talk shows,
*  and that was an anti mainly an anti-vax event, there was a convoy that was in British Columbia
*  that was in response to the unmarked graves that work and whose presences were confirmed at first
*  the former the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School and then more unmarked graves
*  confirmed at other form on the grounds of other former so-called residential schools. I say
*  confirmed because the communities always knew that there were burial grounds on these
*  the grounds of these genocidal schools. But their presence was confirmed using ground penetrating
*  radar. And there was such an outpouring of solidarity in the aftermath of that,
*  that there was a convoy organized by truckers in British Columbia, hundreds of trucks that went
*  and drove in front of the closed former residential school in Kamloops. It was called the We Stand in
*  Solidarity convoy. And, you know, it was it came from a place, as I say, and as they said of
*  solidarity of wanting to say that this is this atrocity, this genocide is not only an issue for
*  First Nations to fight for justice, it should be everybody's business. So it was striking that there
*  was this kind of doppelganger trucker convoy seven months later. But what I say in the book is that
*  some truckers went to both. And so what's interesting to me is the way doppelgangers stand
*  in for the fact that human beings are complicated. You know, I think my own doppelganger is
*  complicated. You know, she I think she's done some very good things in her life, and she's done some
*  really damaging things. Most that's true for most people. So what interests me as as as a political
*  theorist is, you know, what are the systems that encourage the best parts of ourselves that support
*  that impulse toward solidarity and compassion as opposed to light up the most individualistic parts
*  of ourselves? We're spending the hour with Naomi Klein. Her new book is just out. It's called
*  Doppelganger, a trip into the mirror world. Naomi, I wanted to talk to you about
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In July, the Democratic presidential candidate spoke at a press event
*  in New York City and claimed the COVID-19 vaccine is a genetically engineered bioweapon
*  that may have been ethnically targeted to spare people who are Jewish, Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.
*  COVID-19, there's an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races
*  disproportionately. COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people.
*  The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.
*  So that's Robert Kennedy. Naomi, you wrote an article before these comments in The Guardian
*  headlined, Beware, We Ignore Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Candidacy at Our Peril.
*  Now, you write extensively in this piece about his background. It was not just COVID-19 vaccines.
*  He was concerned about he goes way back in his anti-vax attitudes and activism.
*  Talk about the significance of this and what you continually say throughout the book in that
*  we ignore these views at our own peril. Yeah, so I think, I mean, in a way, he is a doppelganger
*  of his father and uncle, and he's sort of, it's sort of, I see it as a kind of a counterfeit
*  politics, I'm sorry, for RFK Jr. supporters who are listening. Don't know how many there are.
*  I think that what he is doing is tapping into a lot of real fears, angers. You know, there are
*  times when I listen to him when I'm, I can't help nodding along when he's talking about regulatory
*  capture of government agencies by the corporations they're supposed to be regulating. That's something
*  I've covered for a long time, you know, or when he's talking about the military industrial complex.
*  I think it's really important. The reason why I call it, you know, a counterfeit politics is that
*  although he is calling this out, if you look at what he's running on, you know, this is not Bernie.
*  He is not actually running on a platform of significant regulations that would address
*  the crises that he is talking about. It's kind of a libertarian platform. I mean, he
*  isn't even running on universal public health care. You know, if you're worried about,
*  if you're worried about big pharma and profiteering, you know, how about running on
*  pharma care that we shouldn't be leaving life-saving drugs to the market, but you'll
*  never hear him say something like that. You know, so I think for leftists who are frustrated with
*  the centrism of the Democrats, it can seem like this is really an alternative, and I would really,
*  really caution against it. And look at what he is actually running on. Is he running on raising the
*  minimum wage? No, he's not. He's tapping into these real critiques and these real issues,
*  like an inflated military budget. But then, you know, his position on Israel, for instance,
*  is just more militarism. Same thing with Steve Bannon, by the way. You know, he talks a great
*  game about the military-industrial complex. He's absolutely obsessed with China and positioning the
*  U.S. for, you know, the Third World War with China. If you're a serious critic of the military-industrial
*  complex, you wouldn't be as focused as Steve Bannon is on China bashing. So, you know, RFK,
*  obviously with that clip that you played, is extraordinarily disturbing, dangerous. A lot of
*  conspiracy culture starts ending up in this kind of anti-Semitic territory, though it's the oldest
*  conspiracy theory in the world. You know, I make the argument in the book that part of what we're
*  dealing with, with the rise of conspiracy culture, and I call it conspiracy culture,
*  not conspiracy theories, because the theories so wildly contradict each other. It's just a posture
*  of mistrust and just throwing wild theories at the wall. So one minute COVID is a bio-weapon,
*  perhaps, and the next minute it's just a cold, so don't even wear a mask. You really would need
*  to choose if you had a theory between whether or not it was a bio-weapon or whether or not it was a
*  cold. If it were a bio-weapon, presumably you would want to do pretty much anything you can,
*  not to be infected. But they never attempt to resolve these glaring contradictions,
*  because the point of it is to throw up this kind of a distraction, so that we aren't focused on
*  the sort of, what I would describe as kind of the conspiracies in plain view, the fact that the
*  pharmaceutical companies turned COVID into this profit center, the fact that despite the fact that
*  so the vaccine development was funded with public dollars, all the initial orders were from the
*  government, there are these outrageous patents on these vaccines, and they should never have been
*  patented in the first place. And I think we need to be really wary of being overly crudulous.
*  We know that there are real conspiracies in the world. You've been covering the 50th
*  anniversary of the overthrow of Salvador Allende, and new documents come out every week that show us
*  these behind-the-scenes meetings. But if we look at that conspiracy, it's a good example.
*  What you see in the documents about the U.S. destabilization campaign of Salvador Allende,
*  it wasn't that there was some nefarious goal about depopulating the earth or draining
*  kids of Adrena Chrome or whatever the conspiracy culture is claiming. It was to protect U.S. copper
*  interests, U.S. telecom interests. It was just capitalism doing its thing, and sometimes it takes
*  a plot to do it, is the way I put it in the book. But coming back to what I was saying earlier about
*  an absence of basic political education, if people don't understand how capitalism works,
*  if we don't understand that this is a system that is really built to consolidate wealth,
*  and it will always have a massive underclass, and instead people have been told that capitalism is
*  just Big Macs and freedom and rainbows and everybody getting what they deserve, then when
*  that system fails them, they're going to be very vulnerable to somebody going, oh, it's all a plot
*  by the Jews, or whatever the conspiracy of the day is. And that's why doing that basic political
*  education and economic education is so critical, because it's really our armor against this
*  conspiracy culture. Well, Naomi, I think you say in the book at some point that the use of the term
*  conspiracy culture is also because one can't call it a conspiracy theory, because it's a conspiracy
*  with no theory. So, you know, RFK and your own doppelganger are emblematic, really, of the number,
*  especially during the pandemic, the number of conspiracies that proliferated and, of course,
*  spread so exponentially, so quickly, both because, of course, everybody on the planet, practically,
*  who was able to do it was online. So if you could speak specifically, conspiracies have always
*  existed. But talk about the power of conspiracies now, just because of their sheer reach,
*  combined with, as you say, this lack of education on a structure within which to understand what's
*  being said. Absolutely. So I think you're absolutely right, Nermeen, that especially during times that
*  are chaotic, during times of disaster, there are often these wild conspiracy theories that emerge
*  because they claim to make some sense of an event that seems senseless, especially when there's just
*  a huge amount of loss. So our minds reach for those kinds of easy explanations. I've seen that. I
*  saw it after Hurricane Katrina. I saw it after the tsunamis. I saw it in Iraq. I've seen it again and
*  again as a reporter. This is different. And what's different is the attention economy, because
*  when all of this is playing out on platforms, private platforms owned by billionaires that
*  have created incentive structures that mean that whoever puts out the most clickable content is
*  going to get the most followers, is going to be able to turn those into subscriptions, be able to
*  monetize them. It creates such a huge incentive structure to be that person first out of the gate,
*  making the wildest claim that you possibly can. So that, you know, I would put conspiracy culture
*  within the framework of the disaster capitalism complex that we have talked about before.
*  You know, we've seen in the aftermath of disasters that these players move in and just attempt to
*  profit from disasters. Conspiracy hucksters and influencers are part of the disaster capitalism
*  complex, but it gets very confusing because often what they're talking about is other people
*  profiting off of disaster. So it's a mirror world. It's trippy. And so you've got to get a little bit
*  trippy to try to map it. I want to ask you, first of all, like what, you know, before we end, what
*  you, you know, the main conclusions of the book are. But I'd also like to read, I mean, your own
*  conclusion, one of the things that you say. Ultimately, it's almost as if you express gratitude
*  towards Naomi Wolf, because of the reflection, the interest in her and what it revealed, not just
*  about our present moment, but also yourself within this social media world. And at the end,
*  you quote John Berger, who you say taught you a long time ago that calm itself is a form of
*  resistance. So first of all, what should people take away the main takeaway from the book and
*  that point itself? Calm is a form of resistance. How is one to attain that calm?
*  Mm hmm. Well, I think maps help. Right. And this is a very first. It's a first draft of a map of
*  the coast, the post covid world. You know, it's just through one person's eyes and it's mapping
*  is collective work. So it's been really great to be out here talking to people, reading articles
*  that people have written, you know, adding to it and adding layers. So I think we're sense making,
*  we're making sense of the way we have changed, the way our world has changed.
*  But I think the big takeaway from the book is all of this is about not seeing, you know,
*  whether we are creating doppelgangers of ourselves online and performing perfected versions.
*  That's a way of distracting ourselves from the weight of our political moment. You know,
*  listening to your headlines, Amy and Nermeen, you know, to quote Antonio Gutierrez, it's an
*  atlas of human suffering. It's so hard to look at the reality that we are in right now with the
*  overlay of endless wars and climate disasters and massive inequality. And so whether we're
*  making up fantastical conspiracy theories or getting lost in our own reflections, it's all
*  about not looking at that sort of that reality that is only bearable if we get outside of our own
*  heads and collectively organize it and rebuild our social movements so that they can offer people
*  material improvements to their lives. That's the only way we fight these surging conspiracies. It's
*  not going to be fact checkers or content moderators. It's going to be a robust left. And I feel I can
*  say that on Democracy Now! And we just have a minute, but let's end where we started with that
*  term doppelganger and what more you want to say about it. And if Naomi Wolf has responded.
*  You know, it's interesting. She posted something this morning, actually, or maybe it was yesterday,
*  casting this as a sort of some sort of a, like my work is some sort of being part of a plot to
*  attack her, which isn't surprising, you know, and she's using it to, to, to, well, okay.
*  I think that this must be very hard for her is what I would say. And, you know, I have really
*  tried to reiterate that she has a case study, an interesting one, but this is not about her.
*  I personally think she's been treated quite cruelly. I'm not interested in, in adding to that.
*  You know, I do think that we need to hold one another accountable, but that doesn't mean that
*  we have a right to be cruel. And, you know, I hope that if she were to actually read the book,
*  she would see that it isn't perhaps the way it's been portrayed as being like,
*  you know, a book length attack on her. It certainly isn't, you know, doppelganger stories.
*  We have to leave it there, Naomi. Naomi Klein, author of Doppelganger,
*  a trip into the mirror world. I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
