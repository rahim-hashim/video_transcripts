*  I don't know what to tell you.
*  It's a hopeless situation.
*  Instead of getting some rest, we dig under the rubble there.
*  This waterline, for your information, we dug it out from under the rubble.
*  We kept digging until we found water.
*  We're back to the Stone Age, 30, 40, 50,000 years ago.
*  We dig water out, filter it from sand, and use it for cooking.
*  We're asking all Arab countries and everyone to figure out a solution, because this is
*  not a solution.
*  We die every day, every minute, every second.
*  Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates is hosting a meeting of Arab nations in a bid to prevent
*  an escalation of a larger regional conflict.
*  The family of two Palestinian-American brothers say the pair, their Canadian father and three
*  other relatives, have been detained after an Israeli raid on their home in Gaza.
*  The brothers, Borak and Hashem al-Aghar, are aged 18 and 20.
*  National Security spokesperson John Kirby says the U.S. will talk to Israel about the
*  detention of the brothers, as well as Samahir Ismail, a Palestinian-American woman from
*  Louisiana, who was forcibly taken by Israeli soldiers at the Occupied West Bank earlier
*  this week.
*  Meanwhile, in the United States, Texas police say the Sunday stabbing in Austin of 23-year-old
*  Palestinian-American Zakaria Dwyer was a hate crime.
*  The Senate voted to advance a $95 billion military funding package for Ukraine, Israel
*  and Taiwan.
*  The measure was stripped of border provisions after Republicans rejected an earlier bill
*  that included an immigration crackdown that they themselves had demanded.
*  Senators will now consider sending an additional $60 billion to Ukraine and $14 billion to
*  Israel.
*  In Illinois, prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against two Northwestern University
*  students who published a mock school newspaper accusing Northwestern of being complicit in
*  the genocide of Palestinians.
*  The reversal comes after the parent company of the Daily Northwestern faced condemnation
*  and the threats to boycott the paper.
*  In labor news, the AFL-CIO has joined other unions in calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of labor unions in the U.S., representing some 12.5
*  million people.
*  The special counsel on investigating Joe Biden's handling of classified documents after his
*  vice presidency has declined to charge Biden despite finding the president, quote, willfully
*  retained and disclosed classified materials.
*  In his report, special counsel Robert Herr said a jury would be sympathetic to Biden and
*  would view him as a, quote, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.
*  Herr made several other references to Biden's memory, which he called significantly limited.
*  Biden later responded to questions about Herr's comments.
*  My memory is fine.
*  My memory—take a look at what I've done since I've become president.
*  None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed.
*  How did that happen?
*  You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on.
*  Later, in the same news conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Egypt's Abdel Fattah
*  al-Sisi as the president of Mexico.
*  The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Colorado's ruling, which disqualified Trump
*  from the primary ballot for engaging in an insurrection.
*  Both liberal and conservative justices expressed skepticism over Colorado's case.
*  This is Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
*  I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide
*  who gets to be president of the United States.
*  In other words, you know, this question of whether a former president is disqualified
*  for insurrection to be president again is—you know, just say it.
*  It sounds awfully national to me.
*  So whatever means there are to enforce it would suggest that they have to be federal,
*  national means.
*  The Supreme Court's decision, expected in the coming weeks, will likely apply to any
*  other state where efforts are underway to remove Trump from the ballot, such as Maine.
*  In other primary news, on Thursday, Trump won the Republican primary caucuses in Nevada
*  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
*  Nevada also held its Democratic caucus, which Biden won.
*  In more election news, the Federal Communications Commission has banned AI-generated robocalls.
*  In Pakistan, early results of Thursday's parliamentary election show independent candidates
*  affiliated with jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan in the lead.
*  Cell phone and Internet services were cut off just as voting began, which opposition
*  candidates denounced as another move by Pakistan's military-backed interim government to rig
*  the election.
*  We'll go to Pakistan for more later in the broadcast.
*  Russia's Election Commission has barred antiwar Putin challenger Boris Nadezhden from
*  running in next month's presidential election.
*  Authorities claimed around 15 percent of the signatures he collected for his candidate
*  application were invalid, putting him below the threshold for qualification.
*  Although President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win the election, Nadezhden has
*  emerged as the opposition's best shot.
*  He's vowed to challenge his disqualification all the way to Russia's Supreme Court.
*  You can take me off the elections.
*  OK, you can.
*  But what will they do with the millions waiting for changes who disagree with the course the
*  country is going?
*  That's the problem.
*  These people are not going anywhere.
*  I will continue working further.
*  We will be moving candidates for elections.
*  We will be organizing a widespread movement.
*  Brazil's federal police has confiscated former President Jair Bolsonaro's passport
*  as he faces accusations of plotting a military coup to overturn his election laws to Luis
*  Ignacio Lula da Silva in 2022.
*  Federal agents carried out 33 searches and four arrests tied to the case Thursday.
*  Bolsonaro and his allies are accused of spreading disinformation about voter fraud, recruiting
*  military officials to support a coup and encouraging far-right protesters to storm government buildings
*  to prevent Lula from taking office.
*  In Haiti, police killed five environmental protection agents Wednesday amid escalating
*  protests demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry and an end to gang violence.
*  Haitian police claimed the environmental agents opened fire first.
*  Clashes were also reported throughout the capital Port-au-Prince, with police firing
*  tear gas and live bullets at protesters.
*  We have no set course.
*  We are on the streets until we succeed in uprooting these gangs at the head of state.
*  U.S.-backed Prime Minister Henry became the de facto ruler following the assassination
*  of Haitian President Jovenal Moïse in 2021.
*  According to a 2022 agreement, Henry was supposed to hold elections and hand over power to the
*  winner this week.
*  But the elections were not held as planned, as Henry claimed he would schedule them only
*  after the country's security situation improves.
*  The U.N. is appealing for over $4 billion in aid for Sudan, which is facing some of
*  the world's worst internal displacement and hunger crises after months of fighting
*  between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary rapid support forces.
*  This is U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths.
*  There is a certain kind of obscenity about the humanitarian world, which is the competition
*  of suffering, a competition between places.
*  I have more suffering than you, so I need to get more attention, so I need to get more
*  money.
*  I don't think there's anywhere quite so tragic in the world today as Sudan.
*  The World Food Program warned last week Sudanese people are dying of starvation as the conflict
*  has cut off many people from accessing aid.
*  This comes as 13 Sudanese asylum seekers died after their boat capsized off Tunisia's
*  coast Wednesday.
*  27 other passengers were missing as of Thursday.
*  The International Organization for Migration found more than 3,000 people drowned in the
*  Mediterranean Sea while attempting to cross to Europe in 2023.
*  And in related news, a Greek court has acquitted 16 humanitarian workers who helped rescue
*  refugees in the Mediterranean in 2015 and 2016.
*  They had been accused of espionage and other charges in what has been condemned as the
*  criminalization of humanitarian work.
*  But the aid workers are not in the clear yet as they still face a separate felony trial
*  with charges including facilitating illegal immigration and money laundering.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
