# Meet Tal Mitnick, First Israeli Jailed for Refusing Military Service in "Revenge War" on Gaza
**Democracy Now!:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnc05oe7KxI)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel is continuing its attacks across the Gaza Strip, from the north to the south, as
*  the number of Palestinian casualties continues to soar.
*  Over the last 24 hours, at least 142 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian
*  Health Ministry.
*  Recently, 25,000 Palestinians have been killed over the past three months, 10,000 of them
*  children, thousands of others missing under the rubble, presumed dead, making Israel's
*  assault one of the deadliest, most destructive military campaigns in recent history.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected calls to scale
*  back Israel's military assault on Gaza or take steps towards the establishment of
*  a Palestinian state.
*  In a nationally broadcast news conference, Netanyahu vowed to press ahead with the offensive
*  until what he called a decisive victory over Hamas.
*  As Netanyahu vows to continue Israel's assault on Gaza, we turn now to the first Israeli
*  to refuse mandatory military service since Israel's offensive began over three months
*  ago.
*  Tal Mitnick is an 18-year-old conscientious objector in Israel.
*  Last month, he announced he would refuse military service, saying, quote,
*  "'I refuse to take part in a war of revenge.'"
*  He was sentenced to 30 days in a military prison, was just released yesterday morning.
*  Tal Mitnick is joining us now from a studio in Tel Aviv.
*  Tal, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Can you talk about why you are refusing?
*  Thank you for having me on.
*  I am refusing because, like I said, I refuse to take part in this revenge war.
*  I'm refusing because I want to make a statement about how we need to conduct ourselves in
*  this land.
*  I feel like there's too much violence here.
*  There is too much revenge and talk about this side or that side.
*  And we need to talk about how we need to go forward in a future of coexistence where both
*  Israelis and Palestinians can live together and live with security and peace.
*  So talk about what exactly this means.
*  How did you make this known?
*  Talk about where you served time in prison.
*  And is this just a brief period of days before you're sent back to prison?
*  Yes.
*  I got sentenced for 30 days for my first sentencing, and I got another draft order for Monday morning,
*  which means I have to get drafted on Monday morning where I will go and refuse service
*  once again and probably get sentenced again.
*  And this will happen over and over until someone gives up, until the army gives me an exemption.
*  So talk about the response of your friends, your family.
*  And I was also just wondering, you're an Israeli, but you have an American accent.
*  Are you American as well?
*  My parents immigrated from the U.S. and we spoke English at home, but I'm Israeli and
*  American, yes.
*  The friends and family response—yes.
*  Go ahead.
*  My friends and family response was thankfully mostly very understanding, because people
*  that know me and people that talk to me know that I come from a good place of nonviolence
*  and coexistence.
*  I feel like the people that got to talk to me, also inside military prison, a lot of
*  them Ben-Gurvier supporters, they support killing all Arabs.
*  When they got to know me before they knew my political opinions, they understood.
*  They understood that there are people that don't support this.
*  Sorry, I can hear myself twice.
*  If you can possibly blank that out, because we're not sure how to fix that right now,
*  but just continue to talk, because we don't hear you twice, but we do hear you very clearly.
*  Can you talk about your time in prison?
*  And where are you being held?
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm being held in a military prison where other soldiers that have committed crimes
*  inside the military and got sentenced to military prison are also being held.
*  It's not a fun experience, but it's also not the worst experience imaginable.
*  It's not like the experience that Palestinian prisoners are being held under in the West
*  Bank or inside Israel.
*  Yeah, it's very strict timing, very strict about what you're allowed to do and when,
*  but this is something that I'm willing to do to make an impact.
*  I'm wondering if you feel the climate is changing among Israelis.
*  And also, what Israelis see about what's happening in Gaza.
*  I mean, we just reported, we're talking about now close to 25,000 Palestinians killed,
*  over 10,000 children, over 7,000 women, many believed to be dead in the rubble.
*  We don't even know that count.
*  If you watch something like Al Jazeera or you watch other media, since there are only
*  Palestinian journalists there on the ground, you see endless pictures of carnage, of horror,
*  of babies being pulled out of the rubble, dead or alive.
*  What do you see on Israeli TV?
*  We're talking about people who are just 15 minutes away from Gaza.
*  So actually, inside prison, the only source of news that we got was one newspaper called
*  Israel Ayom.
*  And every day on the newspaper, there will be pictures of the soldiers that died.
*  And I remember feeling like I feel sad, very sad for the soldiers and the families that
*  have to take this great burden of losing someone close to them.
*  But I know that while seeing soldiers dying, I know that this means that there are much
*  more Palestinian civilians dying, which we don't see in the newspaper.
*  Who else are you serving time with in that prison?
*  Who else is there?
*  Sadly, a lot of the other people there are deserters, which means that they serve time
*  in the military and then at some point, for some reason, they went back home and did not
*  come back.
*  Most of these people desert because of socioeconomic reasons.
*  If it's having to take care of their siblings or go work for their family, and when they
*  come back and turn themselves in, we're now seeing a very heavy sentencing of those
*  deserters as a part of the fascist persecution and the fog of war.
*  People that went to work for three months to feed their family are now being sentenced
*  to half a year in military prison.
*  Can you talk about the overall anti-war movement, if there is one in Israel?
*  I mean, there were massive protests, up to a million people on the streets, which is
*  massive for Israel, around Netanyahu wanting to gut the power of the judiciary.
*  Of course, he is under charges himself, and that would help him remain out of prison.
*  But at that point, many reservists said they would not serve in the military.
*  Everything changed after October 7th, Hamas attack on southern Israel.
*  If you can talk about why that did not change you, and how large is the anti-war movement,
*  and do you feel it's growing?
*  I feel like after the horrendous attack of October 7th against Israeli civilians, there
*  was a very important conception that was broken in Israeli society.
*  The conception that we can live with the siege and with the occupation and not feel it.
*  Now, when that conception is broken, we have a vacuum.
*  And there are two ideas that are trying to pull people.
*  One idea that the right is offering, which is we can't live with occupation, we can't
*  live with siege, this means we need to wipe all of them out.
*  And the other idea, the moderate one, the one that makes sense, is that we can't live
*  with occupation, we can't live with siege.
*  We need to step forward for peace.
*  Inside military prison, I got asked a lot, what do you think?
*  We should just stop the war and put our hands up and not do anything?
*  And I went and said, no, we need to keep fighting.
*  We need to keep fighting for a just future.
*  We need to stop the physical fighting between us.
*  And we need to very, very aggressively push for a better future.
*  I'm hearing your response to Prime Minister Netanyahu once again saying, from the river
*  to the sea.
*  When Palestinian advocates and their allies talk about from the river to the sea, the
*  response of the Israeli government has been, that means they're for the genocide of Jews
*  because they don't want Jews to be there, the government says.
*  Now you have Netanyahu saying—not that this hasn't been said before by Likud—but from
*  the river to the sea, Israel must control.
*  Your response to that, Tal.
*  And if you can talk about the word occupation, because in the U.S. media also, there is rarely
*  that word used that Israel occupies the West Bank and Gaza.
*  The term from the river to the sea is very controversial inside of Israel.
*  And I feel like some people that use it, there are people that use it that mean the genocide
*  of Jews inside Israel.
*  But just the term itself, I feel like, does not mean a genocide of Jews.
*  It means freedom for all Palestinians from the river to the sea.
*  When Benjamin Netanyahu uses this term, it does not mean freedom for all from the river
*  to the sea.
*  It means oppression of Palestinians.
*  And it means Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.
*  Finally, Tal, I'm wondering your response to Jews around the world, particularly here
*  in the United States, like Jewish Voice for Peace, these massive protests that have been
*  held from Grand Central Station to shutting down the bridges and the tunnels from New
*  York to highways in California, saying, We want to ceasefire now.
*  How do you respond to that and your final message to other 18-year-olds, Israelis?
*  These protests are amazing.
*  These organizations like Jewish Voices for Peace and If Not Now do incredible work.
*  And I support the continuation of these protests all around the world.
*  A message to other people my age, other kids, I feel like it's important to know that
*  we have a voice.
*  I used to think that talking to people is all we could do, but we can change and people
*  want to hear what we have to say because we're the future.
*  And this is, yeah, we're the future and we can change.
*  And finally, might you spend months, more than a year, in jail if you keep saying no
*  to military service, since Netanyahu says this will go on for more than a year?
*  Because there's no policy set for jailing conscientious objectors, I don't really
*  know how much time I'll spend in prison, but it could be months.
*  Shalmet Nick, 18-year-old Israeli activist known as a refuse-Nick, he's refused mandatory
*  military service in the Israeli Army, the first conscientious objector in Israel since
*  the Israeli assault on Gaza began over 100 days ago.
*  He's just sentenced to 30 days in prison, which he served for refusing to enlist, was
*  released a few days ago, then will be called up again and says he will refuse again.
