# MLK Day Special: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in His Own Words
**Democracy Now!:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIcbGiZKuvw)

*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Today is a federal holiday that honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
*  He was born January 15, 1929.
*  He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.
*  He was just 39 years old.
*  While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed
*  the cause of the poor, organizing the Poor People's Campaign to address issues of economic
*  justice.
*  And Dr. King was a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War.
*  Beyond Vietnam was the speech he delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April
*  A year to the day before he was assassinated.
*  In it, Dr. King called the United States the greatest purveyor of violence in the world
*  today.
*  Life magazine called the speech,
*  Demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi.
*  The Washington Post said King, quote,
*  Diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people, unquote.
*  Well, today we let you decide.
*  We play an excerpt of Dr. King's speech, Beyond Vietnam.
*  After 1954, they watched us conspire with D.M. to prevent elections which could have
*  surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over to united Vietnam.
*  They realized they had been betrayed again.
*  When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered.
*  So it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi considered the presence of American troops
*  in support of the D.M. regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva
*  agreements concerning foreign troops.
*  And they remind us that they did not begin to send troops in large numbers and even supplies
*  to the South until American forces had moved into the tens of thousands.
*  Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North
*  Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly
*  been made.
*  Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces.
*  And now he has surely heard the increasing international rumors of American plans for
*  an invasion of the North.
*  He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion
*  strategy.
*  Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful
*  nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor,
*  weak nation more than 800, or rather 8,000 miles away from its shores.
*  At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes
*  to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who
*  are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else.
*  For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing
*  process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy.
*  We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after the short period
*  there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved.
*  Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese,
*  and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy and
*  the secure while we create a hell for the poor. Somehow this madness must cease.
*  We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam.
*  I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose
*  culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double
*  price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen
*  of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one
*  who loves America, to the leaders of our own nation. The great initiative in this war is
*  ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours. This is a message of the great Buddhist leaders
*  of Vietnam. Recently one of them wrote these words and I quote, each day the war goes on
*  the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian
*  instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is
*  curious that the Americans who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military
*  victory do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and
*  political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom
*  and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism unquote. If we continue there will
*  be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honor over the war
*  and horrible intentions in Vietnam. If we do not stop our war against the people of
*  Vietnam immediately, the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this
*  as some horrible, clumsy and deadly game we have decided to play. The world now demands
*  a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve. It demands that we admit that
*  we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam, that we have been detrimental
*  to the life of the Vietnamese people. The situation is one in which we must be ready
*  to turn sharply from our present ways in order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam
*  we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war and set a date that
*  we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in accordance with the 1954 Geneva agreement.
*  Part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to Vietnam
*  to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under the new regime which included the liberation
*  front. Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done. We must
*  provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country if necessary.
*  Meanwhile, we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government
*  to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment. We must continue to raise our voices and our
*  lives. If our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam, we must be prepared to match
*  actions with words by seeking out every creative method of protest possible. These are the
*  times for real choices and not false ones. We are at the moment when our lives must be
*  placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions
*  must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest.
*  Now that is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off
*  on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say
*  we must enter that struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing.
*  The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit,
*  and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing clergy and
*  layman concern committees for the next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala and
*  Peru. They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be concerned about
*  Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending
*  rallies without end unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy.
*  And so such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the
*  living God. In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him
*  that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. During the past ten years,
*  we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S.
*  military advisers in Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for our investments
*  accounts for the counter-revolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells
*  why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American napalm
*  and green beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru. It is with such activity
*  in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years
*  ago he said, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.
*  Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role
*  of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and
*  the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments. I am convinced that
*  if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo
*  a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society
*  to a person-oriented society when machines and computers, profit motives and property
*  rights are considered more important than people. The giant triplets of racism, extreme
*  materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered. A true revolution of values
*  will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present
*  policies. On the one hand we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life's roadside,
*  but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho
*  Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as
*  they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin
*  to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.
*  A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty
*  and wealth with righteous indignation. It will look across the seas and see individual
*  capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America
*  only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries
*  and say this is not just. It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South
*  America and say this is not just. The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything
*  to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values
*  will lay hand on the world order and say of war this way of settling differences is not
*  just. This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes
*  with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of people who
*  are normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped
*  and psychologically deranged cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that
*  continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social
*  uplift is approaching spiritual death. America, the richest and most powerful nation in the
*  world can well lead the way in this revolution of values. That is nothing except a tragic
*  death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will
*  take precedence over the pursuit of war. Dr. Martin Luther King, April 4th, 1967 at Riverside
*  Church in New York, explaining why he opposed the war in Vietnam. This is Democracy Now!,
*  the War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman. As we return to Dr. Martin Luther King's
*  speech Beyond Vietnam, he gave this speech April 4th, 1967, a year to the day before he
*  was assassinated. He was speaking at Riverside Church in New York.
*  These are revolutionary times all over the globe. Men are revolting against old systems
*  of exploitation and oppression and out of the wounds of a frail world new systems of
*  justice and equality are being born. The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising
*  up as never before. The people who set in darkness have seen a great light. We in the
*  West must support these revolutions. It is a sad and sad story. We are the people who
*  have seen that fact that because of comfort complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and
*  our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of
*  the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries.
*  This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism
*  is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the
*  revolutions that we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the
*  revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world, declaring eternal hostility
*  to poverty, racism, and militarism. With this powerful commitment, we shall boldly challenge
*  the status quo and unjust morays and thereby speed the day when every valley shall be
*  exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight
*  and the rough places plain. A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that
*  our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop
*  an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual
*  societies. This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concerns about the future
*  and beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing
*  and unconditional love for all mankind. This oft misunderstood, this oft misinterpreted
*  concept so readily dismissed by the niches of the world as a weak and cowardly force
*  has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love, I'm
*  not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I'm not speaking of that force which
*  is just emotional bosh. I'm speaking of that force which all of the great religions have
*  seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks
*  the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist
*  belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of St. John,
*  Let us love one another for love is God and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth
*  God. He that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love. If we love one another God dwelleth
*  in us and his love is perfected in us. Let us hope that this spirit will become the order
*  of the day. We can no longer afford to worship the God of hate. A bow before the altar of
*  retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever rising tides of hate.
*  History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursue this self
*  defeating path of hate. As Arnold Thornberry says, love is the ultimate force that makes
*  for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil. Therefore
*  the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word.
*  We are now faced with the fact my friends that tomorrow is today. We are confronted
*  with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history that is such
*  a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves
*  us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs
*  of men does not remain at flooded ebbs. We may cry desperately for time to pause in her
*  passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and
*  jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words too late. That
*  is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect over
*  our right to move and finger rights and having writ moves on. We still have a choice today.
*  Nonviolent coexistence, a violent co-annihilation. We must move past indecision to action. We
*  must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world.
*  A world that borders on our doors. If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the
*  long dark and shameful corridors of time. Preserved for those who possess power without
*  compassion, might without morality and strength without sight. Now let us begin. Now let us
*  rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter but beautiful struggle for a new world. This
*  is the calling of the sons of God and our brothers wait eagerly for our response. Shall
*  we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Will our message
*  be that the forces of American life militate against their will? Will our message be that
*  they meditate against their rival as full men and we send our deepest regrets? Or will
*  there be another message of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment
*  to their cause, whatever the course, the choice is ours? And though we might prefer it otherwise,
*  we must choose in this crucial moment of human history as that noble part of yesterday James
*  Russell Lowell eloquently stated. Once to every man and nation comes a moment to decide
*  in the strife of truth and falsehood for the good evil side. Some great cause, God's new
*  Messiah often eats the gloom of blight and the choice goes by forever, twigs that darkness
*  and that light though the cause of evil prosper, yet his truth alone is strong. Though her
*  portion be the scaffold and upon the throne be wrong, yet that scaffold sways the future.
*  Behind the dim unknown standeth God within the shadow keeping watch above his own and
*  if we will only make the right choice, we will be able to transform this pending cosmic
*  elegy into a creative psalm of peace. If we will make the right choice, we will be able
*  to transform the jangling discords of our world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.
*  If we will but make the right choice, we will be able to speed up the day all over America
*  and all over the world when justice will roll down like waters and righteousness like a
*  mighty stream. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. April 4, 1967, speaking
*  at Riverside Church in New York explaining why he opposed the war in Vietnam. The speech
*  he delivered exactly a year to the day before he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in
*  Memphis, Tennessee, April 4, 1968. The night before he died, Dr. King delivered his last
*  major address. He was in Memphis to support striking sanitation workers as he built momentum
*  for a Poor People's March on Washington. This is some of Dr. King's last speech.
*  I've been to the mountaintop.
*  And you know, if I was standing at the beginning of time with the possibility of taking a kind
*  of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now, and the Almighty
*  said to me, Martin Luther King, which age would you like to live in? I would take my
*  mental flight by Egypt, and I would watch God's children and see the world. I would
*  walk in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt through, or rather, across
*  the Red Sea through the wilderness on toward the promised land. And in spite of its magnificence,
*  I wouldn't stop there. I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus.
*  And I would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides, and Aristophanes assemble around
*  the Parthenon. And I would watch them around the Parthenon as they discussed the great
*  and eternal issues of reality, but I wouldn't stop there. I would go on even to the great
*  heyday of the Roman Empire. And I would see developments around there through various
*  different ways of thinking. And I would see developments around the great and eternal
*  issues of reality, but I wouldn't stop there. I would even come up to the day of the Renaissance
*  and get a quick picture of all that the Renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of
*  man, but I wouldn't stop there. I would even go by the way that the man of the world
*  for whom I'm named had his habitat. And I would watch Martin Luther as he taxed his
*  ninety-five theses on the door at the church of Wittenberg, but I wouldn't stop there.
*  I would come on up even to 1863 and watch a vacillating president by the name of Abraham
*  Lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the Emancipation Proclamation,
*  but I wouldn't stop there. I would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling
*  with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation and come with an eloquent cry that
*  we have nothing to fear but fear itself, but I wouldn't stop there. Strangely enough, I
*  would turn to the Almighty and see the great man of the world. And I would see the great
*  man of the world. And I would turn to the Almighty and say, if you allow me to live
*  just a few years in the second half of the twentieth century, I will be happy. Now that's
*  a strange statement to make because the world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble
*  is in the land. Confusion all around. That's a strange statement. But I know somehow that
*  only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. And I see God working in this period
*  of the twentieth century in a way that men in some strange way are responding. Something
*  is happening in our world. The masses of people are rising up and wherever they are to symbol
*  today, whether they are in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nairobi, Kenya, or Krogerna, New York
*  City, Atlanta, Georgia, Jackson, Mississippi, or Memphis, Knesset, the cry is always the
*  same, we want to be free. And another reason that I'm happy to live in this period is that
*  we have been forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems
*  that men have been trying to grapple with through history, but the demands didn't force
*  them to do it. Survival, survival, survival, survival, survival, survival, survival, survival,
*  demands that we grapple with them. Men for years now have been talking about war and
*  peace, but now no longer can they just talk about it. It is no longer the choice between
*  violence and nonviolence in this world, it's nonviolence or nonexistence. That is where
*  we are today.
*  And also in the human rights revolution is something getting done and done in a hurry
*  to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their
*  long years of curtain neglect, the whole world is doomed.
*  Now I'm just happy that God has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding
*  and I'm happy that he's allowed me to be in Memphis. I can remember, I can remember
*  when Negroes were just going around, as Ralph has said, so often scratching where they didn't
*  itch and laughing when they were not tickled. But that day is all over. We mean the world
*  in business now and we are determined to gain our rightful place in God's world.
*  And that's all this whole thing is about. We aren't engaged in any negative protest
*  and in any negative arguments with anybody. We are saying that we are determined to be
*  men, we are determined to be people. We are saying that we are God's children. And if
*  we are God's children we don't have to live like we are forced to live.
*  Now what does all of this mean in this great period of history? It means that we've got
*  to stay together. We've got to stay together and maintain unity. You know, whenever Pharaoh
*  wanted to prolong the period of slavery in Egypt, he had a favorite, favorite formula
*  for doing it. What was that? He kept the slaves fighting among themselves. But whenever
*  the slaves get together, something happens in Pharaoh's court and he cannot hold the
*  slaves in slavery. When the slaves get together, that's the beginning of getting out of slavery.
*  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., April 3rd, 1968, the night before he was assassinated. This
*  is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman. As we
*  continue with Dr. Martin Luther King's speech the night before he was assassinated, it was
*  April 3rd, 1968, a rainy night in Memphis, Tennessee.
*  Majestic struggle there. We would move out of the 16th Street Baptist Church day after
*  day. By the hundreds we would move out and Bull Connor would tell them to send the dogs
*  for us. And they did come, but we just went before the dogs singing, ain't gonna let
*  nobody turn me around. Bull Connor next would say, turn the fire hoses on. And as I said
*  to you the other night, Bull Connor did know history. He knew a kind of physics that somehow
*  didn't relate to the trans-physics that we knew about. And that was the fact that there
*  was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out. And we went before the fire
*  hoses. We had known water. If we were Baptists or some other denominations, we had been immersed.
*  If we were Methodists and some others, we had been sprinkled, but we knew water. That
*  couldn't stop us. And we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them and we'd
*  go on before the water hoses and we would look at it and we'd just go on singing, over
*  my head I see freedom in there. And then we would be thrown into paddy wagons and sometimes
*  we were stacked in there like sardines in a can. They would throw us in and old Bull
*  would say, take them off. And they did and we would just go on in the paddy wagons singing,
*  we shall overcome. And every now and then we'd get in jail and we'd see the jailers
*  looking through the windows, being moved by our prayers and being moved by our words
*  and our songs. And there was a power there which Bull Connor couldn't adjust to. And
*  so we ended up transforming Bull into a steer and we won our struggle in Birmingham. Now
*  let me say as I move to my conclusion that we've got to give ourselves to this struggle
*  until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We've
*  got to see it through. When we have our march, you need to be there if it means leaving work,
*  if it means leaving school, be there. And we've got to be there. And we've got to be
*  there. Be concerned about your brother. You may not be on strike, but either we go up
*  together or we go down together. Let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness. And we
*  have to be aware. One day a man came to Jesus and he wanted to raise some questions about
*  some vital matters of life. At points he wanted to trick Jesus and show him that he knew a
*  little more than Jesus knew and throw him off base. Now that question could have easily
*  could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate.
*  But Jesus immediately pulled that question from mid-air and placed it on a dangerous
*  curve between Jerusalem and Jericho.
*  He talked about a certain man who fell among thieves.
*  Do you remember that Alevi?
*  The priest passed by on the other side.
*  They didn't stop to help him.
*  Finally, a man of another race came by.
*  He got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy, but he got down
*  with him, administered first aid, and helped the man in need.
*  Jesus ended up saying this was the good man, this was the great man, because he had the
*  capacity to project the eye into the bow and to be concerned about his brother.
*  Now, you know, we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and
*  the Levite didn't stop.
*  The times we say they were busy going to a church meeting, an ecclesiastical gathering,
*  and they had to get on down to Jerusalem so they wouldn't be late for their meeting.
*  At other times, we would speculate that there was a religious law that one who was engaged
*  in religious ceremonial was not to touch a human body 24 hours before the ceremony.
*  And every now and then, we began to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to
*  Jerusalem, down to Jericho, rather, to organize a Jericho Road Improvement Association.
*  That's a possibility.
*  Maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root rather
*  than to get bogged down with an individual effect.
*  But I'm going to tell you what my imagination tells me.
*  It's possible that those men were afraid.
*  You see, the Jericho Road is a dangerous road.
*  I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem.
*  We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
*  And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, I can see why Jesus used this
*  as the setting for his parable.
*  It's a winding, meandering road.
*  It's really conducive for ambition.
*  You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1,200 miles or rather 1,200 feet above sea
*  level.
*  And by the time you get down to Jericho, 15 or 20 minutes later, you are about 2,200 feet
*  below sea level.
*  That's a dangerous road.
*  In the days of Jesus, it came to be known as the Bloody Pass.
*  You know, it's possible that the priest and the Levite looked over that man on the ground
*  and wondered if the robbers were still around.
*  Or it's possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking.
*  And he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there,
*  to put them there for quick and easy seizure.
*  And so the first question that the priest asked, the first question that the Levite
*  asked was, if I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?
*  But then the Good Samaritan came by and he reversed the question.
*  If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?
*  That's the question before you tonight.
*  Not if I stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to my job?
*  Not if I stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to all of the hours that
*  I usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor?
*  The question is not if I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me?
*  The question is, if I do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to
*  them?
*  That's the question.
*  You know, several years ago I was in New York City, autographing the first book that I had
*  written.
*  While sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up.
*  The only question I heard from her was, are you Martin Luther King?
*  And I was looking down writing and I said yes.
*  The next minute I felt something beating on my chest.
*  Before I knew it, I had been stabbed by this demented woman.
*  I was rushed to Harlem Hospital.
*  It was a dark Saturday afternoon.
*  That blade had gone through and the x-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on
*  the edge of my aorta, the main artery.
*  And once that's punctured, you're drowned in your own blood.
*  That's the end of you.
*  It came out in the New York Times the next morning that if I had merely sneezed, I would
*  have died.
*  Well about four days later they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been
*  opened and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheelchair in the hospital.
*  They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in and from all over the states and the
*  world kind letters came in.
*  I read a few but one of them I will never forget.
*  I had received one from the president and the vice president.
*  I had forgotten what those telegrams said.
*  I had received a visit and a letter from the governor of New York but I had forgotten what
*  that letter said.
*  There was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student
*  at the White Plains High School.
*  And I looked at that letter and I'll never forget it.
*  It said simply, Dear Dr. King, I am a ninth grade student at the White Plains High School.
*  She said, while it should not matter, I would like to mention that I'm a white girl.
*  I read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering and I read that if you had
*  sneezed you would have died.
*  I'm simply writing you to say that I'm so happy that you didn't sneeze.
*  And I want to say tonight, I want to say tonight that I too am happy that I didn't sneeze
*  because if I had sneezed I wouldn't have been around here in 1960 when students all over
*  the South started sitting in at lunch counters.
*  And I knew that as they were sitting in they were really standing up for the best in the
*  American dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which
*  were dug deep by the founding fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been around here in 1961 when we decided to take a ride
*  for freedom and end its segregation in interstate travel.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been around here in 1962 when Negroes in Albany, Georgia
*  decided to straighten their backs up and when other men and women straighten their backs
*  up they are going somewhere because a man can't ride you back unless it is bent.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been here in 1963 when the black people of Birmingham,
*  Alabama aroused the conscience of this nation and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have had a chance later that year in August to try to tell America
*  about a dream that I had had.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been down in Selma, Alabama to see the great movement
*  there.
*  If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been in Memphis to see a community rally around those
*  brothers and sisters who are suffering.
*  I am so happy that I didn't sneeze.
*  They were telling me.
*  Now it doesn't matter now.
*  It really doesn't matter what happens now.
*  I left Atlanta this morning and as we got started on the plane, that was six of us,
*  The pilot said over the public address system, we are sorry for the delay, but we have Dr.
*  Martin Luther King on the plane and to be sure that all of the bags were checked and
*  to be sure that nothing would be wrong on the plane, we had to check out everything
*  carefully and we've had the plane protected and guarded all night.
*  Then I got into Memphis and some began to say the threats, talk about the threats that
*  were out.
*  What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?
*  Well I don't know what will happen now.
*  We've got some difficult days ahead, but it really doesn't matter with me now because
*  I've been to the mountaintop.
*  I don't know.
*  Like anybody I would like to live a long life.
*  Longevity has its place.
*  But I'm not concerned about that now.
*  I just want to do God's will and he's allowed me to go up to the mountain and I've looked
*  over and I've seen the promised land.
*  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get
*  the promised land.
*  So I'm happy tonight.
*  I'm not worried about anything.
*  I'm not fearing any man.
*  My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
*  Dr. Martin Luther King speaking April 3, 1968.
*  Within 24 hours he would be dead, assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, April
*  4, 1968.
*  Today is the federal holiday that honors him.
*  Thank you.
