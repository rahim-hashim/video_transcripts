**Democracy Now!:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUC3ZBUKRpo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, at least five people were killed Wednesday when Israel bombed an UNRWA aid
*  distribution center in Raqqa, one of the U.N. agencies' last remaining aid sites in Gaza.
*  At least one U.N. worker was among the dead.
*  UNRWA workers decried the attack.
*  This is forbidden.
*  We are an international institution.
*  All of this is for people.
*  We stopped returning to our homes.
*  We work day and night to serve refugees.
*  It is forbidden.
*  Look, what is this?
*  We take all of this to the elderly and children.
*  What is this?
*  The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said the attack was a, quote, blatant disregard
*  to international humanitarian law, unquote.
*  The attack comes as much of Gaza's on the brink of famine as Israel continues to limit
*  the amount of aid allowed into the besieged territory.
*  At least 27 Palestinians have died of starvation, including 23 children.
*  Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting six Palestinians were killed in Gaza City when Israeli forces
*  opened fire again on crowds waiting for food aid.
*  Over 80 people were injured, in other news from Gaza.
*  Politico is reporting the Biden administration has privately told Israel the U.S. would support
*  Israel attacking Raqqa as long as it doesn't carry out a large-scale invasion.
*  The UNRWA has announced it wants to transfer most of the over 1.4 million people seeking
*  refuge in Raqqa to what it called humanitarian islands in other parts of Gaza.
*  On Wednesday, one family in Raqqa broke their Ramadan fast in the rubble of their destroyed
*  home.
*  Last Ramadan was great, but this year it's not.
*  A lot of things are not there anymore.
*  My sisters, my family, our house got destroyed.
*  There are still people under the rubble, and they are still not pulled out.
*  This house was the children's dream.
*  Their toys and everything is lost.
*  A new UN investigation has accused Israel of breaking international law over the killing
*  of Reuters video journalist Issam Abdullah in Lebanon.
*  On October 13, an Israeli tank opened fire on Abdullah and a group of other journalists.
*  The UN report stated, quote, the firing at civilians in this instance clearly identifiable
*  journalists constitutes a violation of international law, unquote.
*  Back in the U.S., hundreds of activists partially shut down the international terminal of San
*  Francisco International Airport Wednesday to demand a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and
*  that the U.S. stop arming Israel.
*  Reuters blocked outside traffic and security check-in, forcing SFO to close certain checkpoints
*  and roadways.
*  One traveler stopped to thank the protesters for the disruption.
*  I am slightly inconvenienced, so my trip doesn't go exactly as planned, but I still have a
*  life.
*  I can still live.
*  I'm not dying.
*  I'm not starving.
*  These people are starving.
*  Here in New York, activists successfully canceled a planned real estate event in Brooklyn this
*  week that sought to sell homes built on illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.
*  This came just days after hundreds of activists in New Jersey marched through the streets
*  of Tenex Sunday to protest a similar real estate fair that was taking place in a synagogue.
*  Protests continue on Capitol Hill as well.
*  On Tuesday, members of Jewish Voice for Peace occupied the office of Congressmember Hakim
*  Jeffries, calling on the Democratic leader to reject funding from AIPAC, the American
*  Israel Public Affairs Committee.
*  Jeffries is one of AIPAC's largest recipients.
*  The action came as over 20 groups launched the Reject AIPAC coalition, established to
*  counter the powerful lobby group's influence in D.C., and calling on elected officials
*  to reject endorsements and contributions from AIPAC.
*  The House overwhelmingly voted Wednesday in favor of a bill that would force TikTok's
*  Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell the social media app or face a ban in the U.S.
*  Backers of the bill claim TikTok poses a national security threat.
*  Rights groups like the ACLU say such a ban would violate the right to free speech.
*  There are well over 150 million TikTok users in the U.S. alone.
*  After voting two of the lawmakers who voted against the measure, Democrats Rokana and
*  Pramila Jayapal, laid out some of the bill's issues.
*  It's an overly broad bill that I don't think would withstand First Amendment scrutiny.
*  The other issue is that there are a lot of people who make their livelihoods on this.
*  There are timeline questions.
*  180 days to sell a company this size is very difficult.
*  What happens to antitrust law?
*  Does it still apply?
*  Does it not apply?
*  And I think, you know, the questions of if this is a de facto ban, I think that is a
*  real problem.
*  And so—I also have problems, by the way.
*  Four countries are named.
*  But if Saudi Arabia buys it, is that fine?
*  The measure will now be taken up by the Senate.
*  Meanwhile, Palestinian rights activists say Israel's war on Gaza has galvanized anti-TikTok
*  conservative and centrist lawmakers.
*  In a leaked post-October 7th audio recording, Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation
*  League, can be heard saying, quote, we have a TikTok problem, unquote, referencing declining
*  public support for Israel among younger people.
*  The progressive group Roots Action also noted that AIPAC is the top donor to Congressmember
*  Mike Gallagher, who authored the TikTok ban bill.
*  This comes as Donald Trump flipped his position on the bill within the last week, now opposing
*  the ban after recently meeting with Republican billionaire megadoner Jeff Yass.
*  Yass's company holds a 15 percent stake in ByteDance.
*  A plan to establish a new presidential council in Haiti appears to be crumbling after a number
*  of prominent Haitian politicians and parties have refused to participate.
*  Earlier this week, Caribbean leaders and the United States put forward a plan to establish
*  a seven-person panel to rule Haiti and appoint a new prime minister to replace Ariel Henry,
*  who agreed to resign after facing an armed uprising.
*  In related news, the Biden administration is reportedly considering housing Haitian
*  refugees at Guantanamo Bay if there's an influx of migrants.
*  Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has deployed soldiers from the National Guard
*  to block Haitians from reaching Florida.
*  United Nations and aid groups are warning nearly 230,000 children and new mothers in
*  Sudan could die from starvation in the coming months if their nutritional and health needs
*  remain unmet.
*  The humanitarian crisis in Sudan comes as rival military factions continue to fight
*  despite calls for a Ramadan ceasefire.
*  Earlier this week, the Sudanese military regained control of Sudan's national radio and television
*  headquarters, which had been seized by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
*  In Bolivia, nonstop rain in the capital La Paz prompted authorities to declare a state
*  of emergency earlier this week as overflowing rivers destroyed homes and killed at least
*  one person.
*  Nearly 50 people have been killed due to flooding since the rainy season in Bolivia started
*  in January.
*  This is an official from La Paz.
*  In nearly 80 years, we haven't seen such an event with these characteristics, and
*  in this period, we have had too close to each other.
*  Another unusual event was nine days of continuing rain.
*  There wasn't any minute during these nine days that the city wasn't rainy.
*  In other climate news, the International Energy Agency warns methane emissions remain at near-record
*  highs.
*  The agency said, quote, a 75 percent cut in methane emissions from fossil fuels by 2030
*  is imperative to stop the planet from warming to a dangerous level, unquote.
*  The oil industry is the largest producer of methane, and the U.S. is the largest emitter
*  of methane from oil and gas.
*  Here in New York, activists with climate defiance confronted Chevron CEO Mike Wirth on Tuesday
*  as he spoke at an event promoting, quote, the role of engaged men in gender inclusivity.
*  Chevron CEO Mike Wirth was forced to leave the event.
*  Federal investigators looked into the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max Door blowout, say
*  their work is being hampered by Boeing's lack of cooperation and major issues with
*  its recordkeeping.
*  The National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing was not able to provide the name of
*  the employee who worked on the failed door plug and that Boeing overwrote surveillance
*  footage of the plug's reinstallment.
*  Meanwhile, The New York Times reports Boeing failed 33 out of 89 audits conducted by the
*  Federal Aviation Administration on the 737 Max.
*  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a Texas law that prevents young people from
*  confidentially accessing birth control from clinics.
*  The court ruled clinics can be required to notify and get consent from parents.
*  Planned Parenthood criticized the ruling, saying it marks a, quote, significant and
*  dangerous departure from decades of precedent that's allowed all young people to confidentially
*  get basic health care like birth control through Title X, unquote.
*  In other reproductive rights news, Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting an abortion clinic
*  in Minnesota today in a show of support for abortion rights.
*  It's the first such public appearance by any president or vice president in history.
*  In Georgia, a judge tossed out six of the charges in the wide-ranging election subversion
*  case against Donald Trump and some of his 18 co-defendants.
*  Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee said the charges, which relate to Trump pressuring
*  officials into violating election laws, lack detail, but that prosecutors could seek a
*  re-indictment on those counts.
*  This comes as Judge McAfee is expected to announce his decision soon on whether to disqualify
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis from the case over an alleged improper relationship
*  with a special prosecutor.
*  In Oklahoma, a medical examiner ruled non-binary teen Nex Benedict died of suicide.
*  Sixteen-year-old Nex Benedict's death last month came one day after they were attacked
*  in a girl's bathroom by fellow students at Owasso High School.
*  Benedict's autopsy showed a lethal mix of antihistamines and antidepressants in their
*  system.
*  Nex Benedict identified within the two-spirit transgender and gender non-conforming umbrella.
*  In long time, LGBTQ-plus activist and political adviser David Mixner has died at 77.
*  A friend said the cause of death was complications of long-term COVID.
*  David Mixner was famously close friends with Bill Clinton, whose presidential campaign he
*  worked on, but the relationship fractured after Clinton walked back his promise to end
*  discrimination against LGBTQ people in the military, which Mixner harshly condemned.
*  He was arrested in a 1993 protest against Clinton's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy
*  outside the White House.
*  This is David Mixner on Democracy Now! in 1996.
*  And we've got to get our act together.
*  You know, the Christian coalition's been organizing, they've been taking over school
*  boards, they've been taking over water boards, they've been taking over taxation boards
*  at the local level.
*  And for years, I think, on the progressive movement and on the left, we have accepted
*  the criteria that they're better than the other guy.
*  And so, we have always been put in that position of accepting someone just a little better
*  than someone worse.
*  And I think we shouldn't accept that anymore.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
