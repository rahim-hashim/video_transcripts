*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Fears of a regional war in the Middle East are growing after a top Hamas official was
*  assassinated in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday.
*  Hamas's deputy leader, Salah al-Aururi, was killed in a suspected Israeli drone strike
*  that also killed six other members of Hamas.
*  Al-Aururi was the chief of Hamas's operations in the occupied West Bank.
*  He was also credited with strengthening ties between Hamas and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.
*  In the West Bank, Palestinians are holding a general strike today to protest his assassination.
*  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to give a speech today responding to the killing.
*  While Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, one prominent Israeli
*  lawmaker congratulated the Mossad and Shin Bet on social media.
*  An Israeli army spokesperson said the military was in a, quote, very high state of readiness
*  in all arenas in defense and offense.
*  Lebanon's prime minister, Najib Makati, condemned the drone strike warning the attack, quote,
*  aims to draw Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations, unquote.
*  U.N. officials in Lebanon are urging all sides to show restraint to avoid a wider conflict.
*  As we went to air, Iranian state media reported at least 50 people have been killed and scores
*  injured after at least two blasts went off at an event marking four years since the death
*  General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq.
*  Soleimani was the head of the Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.
*  In Gaza, the death toll from Israel's nearly three-month-long bombardment has topped 22,300.
*  An Israeli strike on the Palestinian Red Crescent's headquarters in Khan Yunis has killed at least
*  five people, including a five-day-old baby.
*  Gemma Connell, who works with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
*  in Gaza, spoke from the El Amal Hospital after the attack.
*  This is a space where children were living.
*  You can see on the floor the blood.
*  The world should be absolutely horrified.
*  The world should be absolutely outraged.
*  A child was killed here today.
*  Four more people were killed here today in a space that should be safe.
*  But there is no safe space in Gaza, and the world should be ashamed.
*  In Rafah, a Palestinian man has set up a tent on the rubble of his former home, which was
*  blown up in an Israeli strike that killed his wife, six children and two grandchildren.
*  Ahmad Abu Slema said he survived because he'd gone out to find food.
*  This place used to be the house of my family, my house.
*  And I'm the only survivor in my family.
*  What separated us was that I wanted to get bread from the bakery.
*  I wish I died with them.
*  I wish there was no four or five minutes when I was away.
*  That would be better than me living like this.
*  Loneliness is tough and parting is hard.
*  But I'm asking God at the beginning of the new year, 2024, to give peace to the people
*  and to give peace to the Palestinian people and for this pain to end.
*  In other news from Gaza, the U.N. says half the population is now at risk of starvation.
*  Arif Hussein, the chief economist at the World Food Program, told The New York Times, quote,
*  I've been to pretty much any conflict, whether Yemen, whether it was South Sudan, Northeast
*  Nigeria, Ethiopia, you name it.
*  I've never seen anything like this, both in terms of its scale, its magnitude, but
*  also at the pace that this has unfolded, he said.
*  In Israel, 42 survivors of the October 7th attack by Hamas are suing the IDF, the Shin
*  Bet Security Service and Israeli police over the massacre.
*  The plaintiffs, who were attending the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel on October
*  7th, accuse Israeli security forces of approving the event amid safety concerns and failing
*  to shut down and disperse the crowd after receiving information about a security breach
*  just hours before the killing spree.
*  This comes as an investigation from The New York Times finds Israeli forces were poorly
*  organized in the response and had no plans to stop such an attack, which went ahead
*  unimpeded for hours.
*  Harvard president Claudine Gay has resigned amidst a mounting firestorm fueled by right-wing
*  politicians and media over free speech and support for Palestinian rights on campus.
*  Claudine Gay, Harvard's first black president, announced she was stepping down Tuesday, just
*  six months into her tenure weeks after University of Pennsylvania president Liz McGill's
*  resignation.
*  Both women resigned in the wake of last month's congressional hearing on anti-Semitism, where
*  they were grilled by lawmakers, including the far-right New York congressmember Elise
*  Stefanik, who gloated two down on social media following yesterday's news.
*  Sally Kornbluth, president of MIT, is the third president Stefanik is hoping to take
*  down.
*  Following the hearing, conservative activists proceeded to smear Gay's academic history,
*  accusing her of plagiarism after uncovering instances of inadequate citations of her work.
*  In her resignation letter, Claudine Gay wrote, quote, It's been distressing to have doubt
*  cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor and frightening
*  to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus, she said.
*  We'll have more on this story with Khalil Gibran Mohammed, a professor at Harvard Kennedy
*  School, after headlines.
*  In Sudan, the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, Mohammed Hamdan Daglow,
*  said his forces are open to an immediate, unconditional ceasefire.
*  Daglow, known as Hamadti, made the declaration Tuesday as he signed an agreement with the
*  newly formed civilian bloc, the Coordination of Civil Democratic Forces, or TAKADOM, which
*  is led by former Prime Minister Abdullah Handok.
*  From here, we apologize to all our people in Sudan and all its states, east, west, north,
*  south and center, for all the violations that took place.
*  We are now extending our hands for peace.
*  If they want peace, welcome.
*  Nothing will make us leave Khartoum except peace.
*  This comes as Hamadti has been touring neighboring countries, meeting with the heads of Uganda,
*  Ethiopia and Djibouti, in what appears to be an attempt to gain legitimacy as Sudan's
*  leader ahead of any cessation of violence.
*  Since the war between the RSF and the Sudanese army broke out last April, over 7 million
*  people have been displaced within Sudan, making it the largest internal displacement crisis
*  in the world.
*  Another 1.3 million have fled Sudan.
*  Thirty million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
*  Reports of mass killings and ethnic cleansing have been mounting in Darfur.
*  Activists say the Sudanese people and its pro-democracy resistance committees are the
*  ones who should decide Sudan's fate and warn the RSF is attempting to whitewash its
*  crimes.
*  The Somali government is denouncing an agreement between Ethiopia and the breakaway republic
*  of Somaliland that would give landlocked Ethiopia access to the Red Sea port of Berbera.
*  The Somali government has denounced the deal as an act of aggression and recalled its ambassador
*  to Ethiopia.
*  Ethiopia's step is an offensive that endangers the stability and peace of the region, which
*  was already wobbling with problems.
*  It is a violation and an open invasion of Somalia's sovereignty, freedom and unity
*  of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
*  The so-called memorandum of understanding and agreement of cooperation is null and void.
*  The breakaway republic of Somaliland has not been internationally recognized since the
*  ceding from Somalia more than 30 years ago.
*  Access to the Red Sea port is allegedly being exchanged for Ethiopia's future recognition
*  of Somaliland's independence, though this has not been confirmed by Ethiopia.
*  Many major multinational companies must for the first time ever pay a global minimum tax
*  of at least 15 percent on corporate profits.
*  The landmark tax reforms went into effect Monday, nearly three years after 140 countries
*  agreed to a new system which is expected to increase tax revenue by $220 billion per year.
*  The U.S. is not currently participating in the reform despite backing the 2021 agreement.
*  The countries that have implemented the 15 percent tax since January 1st include the
*  EU, the UK, Australia, South Korea, Japan and Canada, as well as nations known as tax
*  havens like Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Barbados.
*  The Center for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research said the new global
*  minimum tax would, quote, reduce incentives from companies to use tax havens and incentives
*  for countries to be tax havens, putting a serious break on what was a race to the bottom,
*  unquote.
*  Embattled New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez is facing renewed calls to resign after prosecutors
*  issued a new superseding indictment accusing the Democrat of accepting bribes and abusing
*  his power to benefit the government of Qatar between 2021 and 2023.
*  Federal prosecutors say Menendez publicly praised Qatar in order to aid his associate,
*  businessman Fred Davies, secure an investment from a fund linked to the Qatari government.
*  In exchange, Menendez allegedly received luxury gifts, including gold bars, tickets to a Formula
*  1 race and offers of an expensive wristwatch. Menendez was already facing charges evading
*  the Egyptian government. The senator and his four co-defendants, including his wife and Fred Davies,
*  have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to stand trial in New York City in May.
*  Civil rights leader,
*  Bishop William Barber, is calling for more awareness and justice for disabled people
*  following his ouster from a Greenville, North Carolina movie theater last week.
*  Barber said staff at the AMC theater confronted him over his use of a specialized cherry
*  carries with him and needs to use due to an arthritic condition he's had for decades.
*  The bishop was attending a screening of the color purple with his 90-year-old mother.
*  Bishop Barber says his removal was a violation of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act as
*  he addressed the incident at a news conference this week.
*  The ADA owes its birthright not to any one person. People worked for years. They sent
*  alerts. They drafted legislation. They testified. They negotiated. They filed lawsuits. They stood
*  up in places. They sat down in places. They wouldn't move from places. They fought. They stood.
*  They engaged in nonviolence to say, You will not push us to the corner. You will not block us
*  from coming just because we're differently-abled. They built a movement. They built a movement.
*  Bishop Barber met with the head of AMC yesterday and said he plans another meeting with him.
*  Donald Trump appealed a decision by Maine's Secretary of State to remove him from the
*  Republican primary ballot for his role in the January 6th Capitol insurrection.
*  Trump is also expected to appeal Colorado's Supreme Court decision to remove him from
*  its state primary ballot, which also cited the Insurrection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
*  The case will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where three of the nine justices were
*  chosen by President Trump. And trailblazing U.S. Congressmember
*  Eddie Bernice Johnson has died at the age of 88. In 1972, she was elected to the Texas House of
*  Representatives by a landslide, becoming the first black woman from Dallas to win elected office.
*  She also served in the Texas Senate before winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992,
*  where she served for three decades before retiring in 2022. Eddie Bernice Johnson was
*  a pioneer in many fields, including the first registered nurse elected to Congress, the first
*  African American to represent Dallas in Congress, and the first woman and first African American to
*  chair the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. And those are some of the headlines.
