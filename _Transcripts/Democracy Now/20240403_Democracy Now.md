# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 3, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh6EJPk31MI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel is continuing to face global condemnation over the killing of seven aid workers from
*  Chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen, which had brought food into Gaza by ship to
*  feed starving Palestinians.
*  The aid workers were killed when an Israeli drone fired three missiles at the group's
*  severely marked convoy.
*  According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the drone initially struck one car in the
*  convoy.
*  Then the drone attacked again after survivors from the first attack got into the second
*  vehicle, which kept driving.
*  After the second strike, the injured passengers were taken to the third car in the convoy,
*  which was then also bombed as it attempted to escape.
*  The attack occurred over a one-and-a-half-mile stretch on a coastal road in Gaza.
*  On Tuesday, Israel admitted to carrying out the airstrike and vowed to investigate.
*  At the United Nations, Secretary General António Guterres condemned the Israeli attack.
*  The devastating Israeli airstrikes that killed World Central Kitchen personnel yesterday
*  bring the number of aid workers killed in this conflict to 196, including more than
*  175 members of our own U.N. staff.
*  This is unconscionable, but it is an inevitable result of the way the war is being conducted.
*  The killed aid workers included three British nationals, an Australian, a Polish national,
*  an American-Canadian dual citizen and a Palestinian.
*  President Biden said he was, quote,
*  "'outraged and heartbroken' over the deaths."
*  But at a White House press briefing, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby refused
*  to say if Israel had broken international law.
*  Is firing a missile at people delivering food and killing not a violation of international
*  humanitarian law?
*  Well, Israelis have already admitted that this was a mistake that they made.
*  They're doing an investigation.
*  They'll get to the bottom of this.
*  Let's not get ahead of that.
*  The State Department has a process in place.
*  And to date, as you and I are speaking, they have not found any incidents where the Israelis
*  have violated international humanitarian law.
*  On Tuesday, World Central Kitchen and at least two other groups said they would halt or pause
*  operations in Gaza after the attack.
*  A World Central Kitchen boat, which still held 240 tons of aid on board, left Gaza on
*  Tuesday.
*  Meanwhile, a group of U.S. officials at USAID have privately warned the Biden administration
*  the spread of hunger and malnutrition in Gaza is, quote,
*  "'unprecedented' in modern history' and that parts of Gaza are already experiencing
*  famine."
*  HuffPost reports the cable states, quote,
*  "'An immediate and substantial flow of food, health, nutrition and assistance expanded
*  humanitarian access and safe unimpeded passage for humanitarian workers is paramount to addressing
*  famine conditions in Gaza,' unquote.
*  In Israel, mass protests are continuing against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  On Tuesday night, Israeli police fired water cannons at protesters who gathered outside
*  Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem.
*  Thousands also protested outside the Knesset.
*  We're fighting a war and losing it.
*  And I think the only way we can win the war is to have elections and to give the people
*  the opportunity to choose again and to bring the hostages home and to bring the soldiers
*  home.
*  And that's why I'm here."
*  At the United Nations, Iran has called on the Security Council to take action against
*  Israel for bombing the Iranian consulate in Damascus on Monday.
*  The Israeli attack killed seven Iranian officers, including three generals.
*  Zahra Arshadi is Iran's deputy U.N. ambassador.
*  Primary elections were held Tuesday in Wisconsin, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York.
*  On the Democratic side, a sizable number of voters refused to back Joe Biden to protest
*  his support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  In Connecticut and Rhode Island, more than 10 percent of Democrats voted uncommitted.
*  In Wisconsin, over 8 percent voted uninstructed.
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump won every Republican race on Tuesday, but Nikki Haley still received
*  about 13 percent of the vote in Connecticut, New York and Wisconsin, even though she suspended
*  her campaign.
*  The White House was forced to cancel its planned Ramadan dinner after many Muslim American
*  leaders refused to go to protest Biden's Gaza policy.
*  Instead of a dinner, Biden held a scale-back meeting Tuesday with Muslim American community
*  figures, but that, too, was met with protest.
*  The Palestinian-American Dr. Thara Mohammed, who recently volunteered in Gaza, walked out
*  of the White House meeting after giving President Biden a letter from an 8-year-old orphaned
*  girl named Hadil that read, quote, I beg you, President Biden, stop them from entering Ra'afah.
*  Dr. Thara Ahmed spoke to Middle East Eye after walking out of the White House.
*  You cannot engage and try to get us to come out and show up in the primaries or in November
*  at the same time approving billions of dollars of 2,000-pound bombs that I personally saw
*  devastate the Khamunis and the Balakh and all the areas in Gaza.
*  That sort of cognitive dissonance is not something that our community glosses over.
*  Senegal's new president, Basidou Jomai Fai, has named Usman Sanko to be his prime minister,
*  capping a remarkable three-week period that saw the two opposition figures going from
*  prison to ruling Senegal.
*  Basidou Jomai and Sanko were released from prison in mid-March, just days before Fai
*  won Senegal's election to replace President Macky Sall, who'd attempted to delay the
*  vote.
*  On Tuesday, Fai was officially inaugurated as Senegal's new president.
*  Under my leadership, Senegal will be a country of hope, a country at peace, with an independent
*  justice system and a strengthened democracy.
*  This is my promise based on the oath I have just taken before God and the nation in your
*  presence.
*  I am aware that the results of the ballot box express a profound desire for systemic
*  change.
*  Through my election, the Senegalese people have committed themselves to building a fair
*  Senegal, a prosperous Senegal, a progressing Africa.
*  Fai is the youngest president in Africa.
*  The mayoral candidate of Mexico was assassinated Monday at a campaign event in the city of
*  Salaya in the state of Guanajuato.
*  Berta Gisela-Gaitán was shot dead shortly after she outlined her plans to increase security
*  in the city.
*  The citizens are with us and look after us.
*  Of course, we will have security protocols, which the legal department of the party in
*  the state is reviewing.
*  Gisela-Gaitán was a member of the ruling Morena Party.
*  The Associated Press reports at least 15 political candidates have been killed in Mexico since
*  January ahead of nationwide elections on June 2.
*  Taiwan has been hit with the largest earthquake in 25 years.
*  At least nine people have died, over 800 are injured.
*  The 7.4 magnitude quake toppled dozens of buildings and trapped at least 77 people.
*  In other news from the region, President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke
*  Tuesday for an hour and 45 minutes on the phone.
*  It was their first call since a summit in November.
*  Donald Trump's former lawyer, John Eastman, has been disbarred in California for his role
*  in trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 election.
*  A California judge wrote in her ruling, quote,
*  Eastman's wrongdoing constitutes exceptionally serious ethical violations
*  warranting severe professional discipline, unquote.
*  Eastman is a former law school dean at Chapman University School of Law.
*  In educational news, Pitzer College in Claremont, California, has closed its study abroad program
*  with the University of Haifa in Israel in what's being viewed as a major victory for the BDS,
*  Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
*  The move comes after years of student organizing and a vote in February by Pitzer's Student
*  Senate to suspend all institutional ties with Israeli universities.
*  According to the National Chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, Pitzer has become
*  the first U.S. school to impose an institution-wide boycott of an Israel study abroad program.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
