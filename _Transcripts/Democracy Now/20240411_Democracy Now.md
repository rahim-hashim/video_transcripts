# American Surgeons Return from Gaza, Call for End of U.S. Culpability in Genocide
**Democracy Now:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhI2Rlt3SSc)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.
*  Welcome to our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
*  And a very happy early birthday to Amy Goodman.
*  We begin today's show in Gaza, where Palestinians mark the end of Ramadan as Israel's six-month
*  assault continues.
*  In a minute, we'll speak with two doctors just back from volunteering at the European
*  Hospital in Gaza, who co-authored a new piece for Common Dreams headlined, We Have Never
*  Seen Cruelty Like Israel's Genocide in Gaza.
*  In it, they wrote, quote, As humanitarian trauma surgeons, we've both seen incredible
*  suffering.
*  Collectively, we were present at Ground Zero on 9-11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 earthquake
*  in Haiti on the first day of these disasters.
*  We've worked in the deprivation of southern Zimbabwe and the horrors of the war in Ukraine,
*  and attended primary trauma services to those injured in the Boston Marathon.
*  Together, we've worked on more than 40 surgical missions in developing countries on three
*  continents in our combined 57 years of volunteering.
*  This long experience taught us that there was no greater pain as a humanitarian surgeon
*  than being unable to provide needed care to a patient.
*  But that was before coming to Gaza.
*  Now we know the pain of being unable to properly treat a child who will slowly die, but also
*  alone, because she's the only surviving member of an entire extended family.
*  We have not had the heart to tell these children how their families died—burnt until they
*  resembled blistered hot dogs more than human beings, shredded to pieces such that they
*  can only be buried in mass graves or simply entombed in their former apartment buildings
*  to die slowly of asphyxia and sepsis.
*  For more, we're joined by the two surgeons who wrote that piece.
*  In Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Dr. Mark Perlmutter is with us.
*  He's an orthopedic hand surgery specialist who just returned Monday from volunteering
*  at the European Hospital in Chanyunas, Gaza.
*  He worked with the Palestinian American Medical Association in collaboration with the World
*  Health Organization.
*  He's currently president of the World Surgical Foundation, immediate past president of the
*  International College of Surgeons.
*  And in Salt Lake City, Utah, we're joined by Dr. Feroz Sidwa, a trauma surgeon who's
*  also just returned from European Hospital.
*  He also worked with the Palestinian American Medical Association in collaboration with
*  the World Health Organization.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  I mean, those words that you wrote in this piece, and we thank you so much for joining
*  us on the day after you finally both got back to the United States.
*  I wanted to just read one more part from your piece and get Dr. Feroz Sidwa to respond.
*  As you talked about European Hospital, you said, we walked through the wards and immediately
*  found evidence of horrifying violence deliberately directed at civilians and even children, a
*  three-year-old boy shot in the head, a 12-year-old girl shot through the chest, an ICU nurse
*  shot through the abdomen, all by some of the best trained marksmen in the world.
*  Dr. Sidwa, describe your two weeks there in European Hospital and what this meant, how
*  it compares to other work you've done around the world.
*  Sure.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  The things that struck me about working at Gaza European Hospital were that there were
*  a few.
*  One was the actual state of the hospital.
*  The infrastructure of the hospital is completely overwhelmed because not only the massive casualties
*  that it's receiving and also having to deal with the normal medical problems that this
*  hugely displaced population has coming down from the north, but also the infrastructure
*  is just completely overwhelmed by this humongous displaced persons camp that's not only outside
*  of the hospital but actually inside.
*  Every square inch of the hospital, the hallways, even the wards is taken up with tents that
*  people have constructed from the detritus of their house.
*  So it's just completely overwhelmed.
*  Sanitation is impossible.
*  Even basic cleanliness is impossible.
*  The hospital is just barely hanging on by a thread in terms of functionality.
*  And the other thing that was really causing the hospital major problems is that the staff
*  extremely not only traumatized, but they haven't even been paid since October 7th.
*  100% of the staff are just working on a voluntary basis.
*  And that's in the middle of still having to provide for their own family's safety, their
*  own family's food provisions, sanitation, things that normally are just happening automatically.
*  The medical students displaced from the north all came down and just spontaneously decided
*  to volunteer at Gaza European Hospital.
*  They're kind of running the emergency room as best they can.
*  While other physicians have been displaced, some of them have been killed, some of them
*  have been threatened by the Israelis and have left because of that.
*  So it's a very difficult situation.
*  The second thing that really struck me was the degree of violence that was being utilized.
*  The magnitude of injury that's caused by the bombs that the U.S. bombs that Israel
*  is using is really dramatic.
*  These weapons are—the blast effect is incredible.
*  They throw the environment itself through these patients.
*  And I don't even just mean large pieces of shrapnel like from the tile floor in the wall
*  or whatever being ripped up and thrown into people, which that happens too.
*  But literally, just the dust, the debris, everything is just embedded in the patient's
*  skin.
*  And it makes clean surgical operations just simply impossible.
*  You'd have to rip the person's—all of their skin off to make them—to sanitize
*  anything.
*  And then the third thing was the evidence, like you mentioned, that we wrote, the evidence
*  of the directed violence specifically at children.
*  I mean, you can maybe argue that a bomb went off and a kid just happened to meet nearby,
*  but it's not believable that the best trained marksman in the world accidentally shot a
*  three-year-old boy in the head, accidentally shot a two-year-old girl twice in the head,
*  accidentally shot—you know, it just goes on and on.
*  And that was—I knew about it before I went, but to see it in person was really pretty
*  shocking.
*  And I think the last thing that I would say that struck me was the attempt of the Palestinians
*  to maintain their dignity and their humanity, even in such really horrifying circumstances.
*  They stayed in family units as much as they could.
*  They tried to continue their traditions of Ramadan.
*  Even though they're all desperately hungry and thirsty, they would still fast during
*  the day.
*  And it was the maintaining of their culture, maintaining their family units, maintaining
*  their belief that the future can be better.
*  That was really quite dignified, in my opinion, and it was very, very impressive to see.
*  Dr. Mark Perlmutter, you know, you and Dr. Siddva sent us a number of extremely graphic
*  videos and photos, some of which we are showing for our television viewers.
*  If you could explain why you think it's important for American audiences to see these
*  graphic images, and then also explain why you, as an orthopedic hand surgery specialist,
*  why you made the decision to go to Gaza.
*  Absolutely.
*  First, happy birthday to you again.
*  I'd like to echo what my newfound best friend, Feroz, had said.
*  And realistically, what impressed me the most was the overt genocide that I was suspecting
*  was going on.
*  That's what brought me there.
*  I was involved into a telehealth network providing advice to young orthopedic surgeons providing
*  surgery in Gaza.
*  And then when I realized, based on direct feedback, that these very misplaced pins and
*  screws were being performed by trainees without guidance because their attending orthopedic
*  surgeons were killed or captured and imprisoned inside of Israel, and that they were flying
*  without instruction, that I'd make a commitment to go.
*  When I got there, echoing what Feroz had said, genocide was the overwhelming impression that
*  I got.
*  There are distinct signs of genocide.
*  First of all, the bombs are cluster bombs.
*  We've taken small pieces of shrapnel, dozens of pieces of shrapnel, out of toddlers, infants
*  and teenagers.
*  The country's 50% children, if not more.
*  Overwhelmingly, our victims were children.
*  I would say 70 to 75% of the people that we operated on were elementary school age or
*  younger.
*  The injuries were devastating, as Dr. Sidwa said.
*  The world's best marksmen are not going to shoot a kid in the forehead twice and in the
*  abdomen.
*  These are midline shots directly aimed, and that doesn't happen by accident.
*  Secondly, the bombing was concentrated at the time of evening prayers.
*  It happened all day long, but it was distinctly, purposefully concentrated when the Muslims
*  were gathered together in tight units, shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee, praying to God.
*  While they're being bombed, and the cluster bombs are infinitely more effective when the
*  intended target is concentrated into a smaller location.
*  That defines genocide.
*  The cluster bombs are illegal.
*  The snipers aimed distinctly at children are unethical and illegal.
*  And then, of course, the way that you dehumanize a population is to kill the humans.
*  You deprive them of their medical schools, their clinics, their ambulances.
*  Sure, there was a big American and worldwide justified outcry when the World Central Kitchen
*  vans were distinctly and purposefully bombed right through the center of their hoods.
*  But prior to that, 200 ambulances were targeted by the Red Cross.
*  In this case, it's a red crescent, very prominently displayed on top of an ambulance.
*  They have very modern ambulances.
*  There is no mistake in that they were ambulances that were bombed.
*  200 were destroyed along with the paramedics.
*  Doctors were distinctly shot.
*  An orthopedic surgeon was shot in his knee while he's operating on a patient because
*  the soldier commanded him to leave the operating room and he refused to abandon his patient
*  quite ethically.
*  He had his knee blown out across the room.
*  He was immediately fixed by his trainees.
*  And two days later, he was imprisoned by Israel for 45 days.
*  According to him, a juice box every other day blindfolded the entire time, dropped off
*  a non-road prison border to crawl for three kilometers until somebody rescued him.
*  Blinded one eye because a rifle but exploded his right eye.
*  This is dehumanization.
*  This is the purpose of this is to kill a population.
*  Food delivery.
*  When we left, there was tens of miles of incoming food trucks, four lanes, the entrance into
*  Gaza and the exit road into Gaza were all lined on both shoulders of the road with tens of
*  miles of food trucks parked bumper to bumper to bumper trying to get into the country,
*  of course, which is limited by the IDF or the Israeli government.
*  Why aren't they letting the food in if not for it to deprive the population of the substance
*  that they need to survive?
*  This is another definition of genocide.
*  There's no reason why they can't let even inspected food trucks in.
*  The product can be inspected.
*  I'm sure it should be inspected.
*  But this is life's sustaining materials.
*  The hospitals, if we didn't bring our orthopedic implants, if we didn't bring our dressings,
*  if we didn't bring medicines, they would be devoid of all of this.
*  Another definition of genocide.
*  And Dr. Perlmutter, explain about the photos, the photos and the videos, why you think those
*  are so important for American audiences to see, the ones that you and Dr. Sidra sent?
*  Because the American public and I'm sure the German public, the two societies that
*  are most responsible for sustaining this genocide, their media is being sterilized.
*  If they saw pictures of babies with 10 pieces of shrapnel in their, in its one-year-old forehead
*  and throughout its face, if they saw a 12-year-old missing all of their limbs and burnt,
*  like we said in our letter, like an ignored hot dog on a grill, if they actually saw the
*  dehumanization, the degree of it, the ubiquitous widespread nature of it, then they would open
*  their eyes and realize that we're responsible for this.
*  The big reason why I went is mea culpa.
*  My tax dollars are paying for the bombs that are killing children.
*  And that's horrible.
*  You know, if we have a lot of school shootings in the United States, if a gunman goes into a school
*  and starts killing children, the American response, the world given a response is a sniper
*  team goes in and tries to take out the offending gunman, regardless of their age.
*  The Israeli response is to drop a bomb on the school to kill the gunman, but also incinerate
*  the hundreds and hundreds of children, perhaps thousands that could be living in that school,
*  and incinerate them all just to get the single gunman.
*  What America doesn't understand is that the Hamas soldiers comprise less than one-tenth
*  of one percent of the population of Palestine, of Gaza.
*  The analogy of killing innocent children in a school just to kill the single gunman holds.
*  If an orphanage had an infected rat sneak into it, you don't incinerate the entire orphanage
*  to get rid of the rat that snuck into the orphanage.
*  But that's exactly what we're doing, except that we're giving the bombs to Israel
*  to bomb the orphanage. We're buying the bullets and the gun for the gunman who's going into the
*  school and killing innocent children. We're responsible, and we have to open our eyes as a
*  society and realize that it's not just seven aid workers that unfortunately died, but there were
*  17,000, 18,000 children that are shredded like paper. They just don't happen to be white children,
*  and we have to open our eyes and care about them as much as we care about the seven aid workers
*  that very unfortunately died. I want to ask both of you a question,
*  starting with Dr. Paul Mutter. I mean, you're credentials, you are an orthopedic surgeon,
*  you are head of the World Surgical Foundation, past president of the International College of
*  Surgeons, you're both American. Dr. Paul Mutter, you're from a Jewish American family,
*  your twin is an Orthodox Jewish woman, Dr. Froze Sidwas Rastrian. I wanted to ask you,
*  Dr. Paul Mutter, you wrote two emails to the U.S. Embassy in Israel when you went,
*  pleading with them not to attack European Gaza hospitals, saying we're deathly afraid of being
*  bombed again, as we were this morning. What happened to you, and did the U.S. Embassy respond to you?
*  I sent them two letters, one when the bombs were shaking and they were shaking the fillings out of
*  our teeth. It is as if lightning struck in inches away from you. That's how much vibration the
*  hospital ground sustained. The bombs did not actually enter into the walls of the hospital,
*  they completely surrounded the hospital. The entire event occurred specifically
*  to destroy the population outside the hospital. We were in fear of our lives, we were particularly
*  in fear of our lives right after the bombing of the U.N., I'm sorry, the World Central Kitchen
*  Convoy. While we were in full knowledge that doctors were being kidnapped and targeted,
*  almost 100 journalists were killed, the destruction of multiple ambulances,
*  we felt targeted from the beginning. So as we were approaching the end of our trip,
*  and after we've heard that all other hospitals were being thoroughly destroyed and their surgeons
*  being kidnapped, we were in fear of our own lives. More importantly, we're in fear of the
*  tens of thousands of people that sought refuge in that hospital compound, hoping that a hospital
*  would not be targeted. So I wrote the American Embassy to both the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv offices.
*  They sent me a return email acknowledging receipt of my first email. I've received no
*  response from them. I've got acknowledgement from the first email that I sent. I sent a second email
*  saying, this is the day we're leaving, could you please inform the IDF that our convoy, just like
*  the World Central Kitchen's convoy, is leaving at this time on this date. This is the vans,
*  this is what the vans look like. This is the timing that we're going to leave, and I received
*  no response from them as well. You are talking to us from the hospital. You're in your scrubs in
*  Rocky Mountain, North Carolina. And Dr. Feroz Sidwa, you're in Salt Lake City on your way back to
*  Stockton, California, where you work. I'm looking at your piece again in Common Dreams, Dr. Sidwa.
*  You write, no amount of medical care could ever compensate for the damage being inflicted here.
*  Israel's dropped so much American ordinance on Gaza that it now exceeds the explosive force of
*  the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Can you talk about what you would say if you got to speak
*  to President Biden? We interviewed Dr. Thayer Ahmed, who had just returned from Gaza. We believe
*  he's the first doctor on the ground in Gaza to actually directly address the president. He handed
*  him a letter from an eight-year-old Palestinian orphan and then walked out of the White House.
*  He said, what can be said about what is happening here right now is the day after the attack on the
*  World Central Kitchen. What is your message, and not only to the president, but around the world,
*  Dr. Sidwa? I don't think I would say much to Joe Biden. I think he knows exactly what's going on,
*  and I don't think it's important to him. I don't think he cares if Palestinians are murdered like
*  roaches and ants. But to the rest of Americans who have normal human values, they do care.
*  One of the other things that Mark and I wrote in that piece is that the blood on the trauma bay
*  floor and the operating room floor was dripping from our hands. I think that's accurate. Again,
*  we provide the crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support. Your viewers are no surprise
*  to that. That makes us responsible. If our support stops, the attacks stop. If our support stops,
*  the occupation stops. It's instant. It's been proven a hundred times. It's not hard to see.
*  So that's what I would say to people is if you want to stop participating unwittingly
*  in some of the worst crimes that I've ever seen in my life,
*  then you need to organize and you need to raise the cost to people like Joe Biden,
*  because that is the only thing they care about. The U.S. is attempting to manage the Middle East
*  with the system that I've put in place since the Arab Spring. The Palestinians are just kind of an
*  annoyance to that system. The U.S. doesn't want Saudi Arabia to have its ruling family shaken,
*  the Jordanian ruling family shaken. But we have to raise the domestic cost for these policies,
*  which like Mark said, are really truly genuinely genocidal in nature. It's dramatic.
*  So I would say to people that you know what's going on, so stop thinking about it all that much
*  and just start acting. Go to your houses of worship. Go to your community centers.
*  Go wherever it is that you go and talk to people and say, look, let's go talk to our congressman
*  in person. Let's demand a meeting. If you're a veteran, put your uniform on and go. I've had
*  several veterans reach out to me. Put your uniform on. Go talk to your congressperson. Film it. Put
*  it online. Do anything you can to embarrass these people and to make it obvious to the world that
*  they are not acting with normal human decency in mind. They're acting with purely cold,
*  almost mafia-like political calculations. And the only way that we are going to stop this is by
*  raising the cost to them of doing so. That's what I would say to people, I think. Well, Dr.
*  Siddhartha, of course, the justification, the continued justification for Israel's assault
*  is the fact that they're targeting Hamas militants. You treated, we've just heard from both of you
*  about the number of children you treated, mostly, as you said, elementary school children or below
*  the age of elementary school. You dealt with numerous mass casualty events while you were at
*  the European Hospital in Khan Younis. How many military-age males did you treat?
*  I can count them on one hand. I think it was probably four or five, and not one of them.
*  Obviously, like Mark said, the people who are actually in Hamas or other Palestinian
*  military organizations is an extremely small number, even of military-age men in the Gaza Strip.
*  But we treated literally a handful, five at the very most, that I can remember,
*  military-age men while we were there for any injury at all. And the overwhelming consensus
*  in the hospital was that if actual militants were to come in, they would actually come in with their,
*  I don't know the technical terms, but with their unit and with their commander,
*  and they would be spirited away from the hospital as soon as they were well enough to be taken out
*  of the hospital. That never happened once to anybody. So I seriously doubt that I encountered
*  a single combatant while I was there. It was a 100% civilian. I think the people I cared for were
*  100% civilians, even including the military-age men that I took care of.
*  Finally, Dr. Perlmutter, if you could say what you think the medical needs there are now—I mean,
*  there are no fully functional hospitals left at all. You've said that you could operate 12 hours
*  a day, seven days a week, for years, and not make a dent, because the needs are so great.
*  So what can be done for people in Gaza suffering in this way as this war goes on?
*  Two points. First, I've seen more orthopedic injuries in my two weeks there than I have seen
*  in my entire 30-plus years of practicing and the additional 10 years of training before that.
*  If I operated 12 hours a day, seven days a week, it would take me 20 years for me to make a
*  notable dent, a minuscule dent, in the amount of orthopedic alone pathology that's there.
*  The extent of damage of carnage is that widespread. In order to make a difference,
*  it's not by supplying supplies. It's by eliminating the genocide. It's imposing controls
*  on Israel. It's by reaching out, as Dr. Sidwa said to our senators, that letter that you read.
*  I sent a copy of that to every single sitting U.S. senator. I called Chuck Schumer's office
*  from Gaza while I'm being bombed and spoke to his secretary and said the noises in the background
*  are American bombs being dropped by American warplanes gifted essentially to Israel.
*  I'm in fear that they're going to kill me. I'm in bigger fear that it's going to keep me up all
*  night with another dozen shredded children and women. As Dr. Sidwa said, I don't think I saw
*  one person who would qualify as a military combatant. The victims were civilian, virtually
*  100 percent. I would echo his plea to please contact your state senator and House of Representatives
*  and the federal ones as well. Share with them the knowledge that the sterilized history that
*  they've been receiving and the sterilized facts that they have been receiving are in fact
*  inaccurate, that there's true bloodshed that's going on at our hands, that we're paying for.
*  They need to wake up and realize that it's not the pay off from the Israeli
*  political action committee that really matters to keep their jobs moving forward and their
*  reelection occurring. What really should matter is the ethical basis of what they're charged to do,
*  and that's to maintain the viability of the United States image and our leader as a democratic nation
*  supporting perfect ideals and not advancing their own personal agenda by supporting a state
*  that's recklessly killing innocent women and children, something that every American should
*  stand against. Dr. Mark Perlmutter, we want to thank you so much for joining us, orthopedics,
*  hand surgery specialist, president of the World Surgical Foundation, immediate past
*  president of the International College of Surgeons, speaking to us from now, his hospital
*  on Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in his scrubs. And Dr. Feroz Sidwa, trauma surgeon, speaking to
*  us from Salt Lake City, heading back to Stockton, California, where he works. They just returned
*  Monday from volunteering at the European Hospital in Khan Yunis, Gaza. We'll link to the piece they
*  co-authored in Common Dreams, We Have Never Seen Cruelty Like Israel's Genocide in Gaza.
*  you
