# NYT Exposé Shows Migrants Kids in U.S. Are Forced into Brutal Jobs for Major Brands
**Democracy Now!:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A--qJPFV1hM)
*  And this is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!
*  co-host Juan González in Chicago, where it's Election Day.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  We begin today's show looking at a shocking investigation by The New York Times exposing
*  the forced labor of migrant children, as young as 12, at factories across the United States.
*  Over 100 unaccompanied migrant children, mostly from Central America, describe grueling and
*  working conditions, including having to use heavy machinery, being subjected to long hours
*  and late night shifts at facilities that manufacture products from major brands and retailers,
*  such as Harth Side Foods Solutions, the makers of Cheerios, Fruit of the Loom, Whole Foods,
*  Target, Walmart, J.Crew, Frida Lay and Ben & Jerry's.
*  Others were forced to work as cleaning staff at hotels, at slaughterhouses, construction
*  owned by General Motors and Ford in serious violation of child labor laws.
*  At least a dozen migrant child workers have been killed on the job since 2017, according
*  to The New York Times.
*  The disturbing revelations prompted the Biden administration to announce Monday a wide initiative
*  to crack down on the labor exploitation of migrant children.
*  White House Press Secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre called The New York Times investigation heartbreaking.
*  At the president's direction, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and
*  Human Services announced new actions to crack down on child labor violations and ensure
*  that sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children are vigorously, rigorously vetted.
*  Child abuse—child labor is abuse, and it is unacceptable.
*  Again, it is unacceptable.
*  This administration has long been combating a surge in child exploitation, and today the
*  Department of Labor and HHS announced that they will create a new interagency task force
*  to combat child exploitation.
*  They will also increase scrutiny of companies that do business with employers who violate
*  child labor laws, mandate follow-up calls for unaccompanied migrant children who report
*  safety concerns to the HHS hotline and audit the sponsor vetting process for unaccompanied
*  migrant children over the next four weeks.
*  The Labor Department has already launched an investigation into Harthside Food Solutions,
*  which produces and packages food for other major companies, like General Mills, Frito-Lay
*  and Quaker Oats.
*  Democracy Now! reached out to Harthside Food Solutions to invite a company's spokesperson
*  to join us on the program.
*  They declined the request, but sent us a statement to read on air.
*  The statement reads, in part,
*  And for more, we're joined by two guests.
*  Hannah Dreier is the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at The New York Times, whose major
*  investigation published Sunday on the front page is headlined, Alone and Exploited Migrant
*  Children Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S.
*  Her follow-up piece published Monday, headlined, Biden Administration Plans Crackdown on Migrant
*  Child Labor.
*  She's joining us from here in New York.
*  You traveled to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia
*  Speaking to more than 100 migrant child workers in 20 states, Hannah, can you lay out the
*  scope of this investigation, what you found, and were you shocked by the speed of the Biden
*  administration's response and your evaluation of what that is?
*  Thank you so much for having me, Amy.
*  I mean, when I started this reporting, I thought that we might find that some kids were working
*  agricultural jobs, maybe dishwasher jobs.
*  I never anticipated that we would find this scope of children working these really industrial,
*  adult, dangerous jobs in all 50 states.
*  So really, what I discovered is, I think, a child labor scandal in this country.
*  We have more and more kids coming over without their parents, and they're being released
*  to situations where they have to pay their own rent, provide their own living expenses,
*  they're under huge pressure to send money back home, and they're ending up in some
*  of the most brutal jobs in this country.
*  So I talked to kids outside of slaughterhouses when they were getting off their shifts at
*  seven in the morning.
*  I talked to kids who were working as roofers at the top of buildings, kids who had gotten
*  seriously injured.
*  Like you say, we found many examples of kids who had died on these jobs.
*  And it's in the supply chain of, you know, so many corporations.
*  At the end of this reporting, I just felt like it was inescapable, like so many of the
*  things that I personally consume, like Cheerios, have this labor somewhere in the supply chain.
*  And yeah, I mean, the response was overwhelming.
*  We were told that the Biden administration worked over the weekend, and Biden approved
*  these changes, like on Sunday afternoon, a day after the story ran.
*  It's really gratifying.
*  The people who I'm talking to believe that there's still a lot to be done, but some
*  of these changes really do seem like they will start to address this problem.
*  And Hannah, in your investigation, how recent is this development?
*  In other words, there was enormous pressure following the end of the Trump administration
*  to remove unaccompanied minors from detention facilities.
*  Is this a recent phenomenon, or has this been building for years now?
*  This is something that I think has been building for maybe the past 10 years, and part of it
*  has to do with the changing nature of the children who are crossing the border.
*  Ten years ago, there were far fewer children, maybe 6,000 children a year.
*  Now we're seeing 150,000 a year.
*  Those children were often coming to reunite with their parents, so they would cross the
*  border and be released to a parent who often would take care of them, often that parent
*  would have paid to have them brought up.
*  And now what we're seeing is it's much more common for parents to be sending these
*  children, and the children are under pressure to send back remittances.
*  So the dynamic of who's coming has changed, and we've also seen a labor shortage.
*  We've seen a couple dynamics that have sort of created a perfect storm for this phenomenon
*  to really explode since 2021.
*  And what the people who work with these kids out in the field are telling us is that they've
*  seen this huge shift in the last three years—middle schools, where every eighth grader in the last
*  three years has started working, federal investigators, who used to focus on sex crimes and are now
*  instead focusing on pulling 12- and 13-year-olds out of factory jobs.
*  It's been sort of a slow shift, and then, in the last two or three years, it's really
*  rapid change.
*  And your story indicates that HHS Secretary Javier Becerra did put enormous pressure on
*  other government agencies, as well as his own agency, to move the unaccompanied minors
*  out of the detention facilities.
*  How do you assess the role of Secretary Becerra?
*  You know, a lot of advocates, a lot of people in the immigration world, were really excited
*  about Becerra and about the change that they thought might happen at HHS after the Biden
*  administration took over.
*  But what happened was there was this huge crunch at the border, where all of a sudden,
*  children were sort of getting piled up in jails that are run by Customs and Border Protection,
*  because there wasn't enough capacity in the child welfare organization that's supposed
*  to take care of these children, that's Health and Human Services.
*  So there was suddenly all of this media attention to kids sleeping on the floor, sleeping under
*  those silver space blankets.
*  And what people inside HHS say is that Becerra started putting immense pressure on them to
*  discharge these kids more quickly.
*  So every day would start with a call, and the call would be, how many kids have been
*  discharged from care today?
*  How many kids are still there?
*  And what people who work at all levels of that agency say is that it created a situation
*  where kids were being pushed out too quickly to people who weren't vetted.
*  And a lot of people inside the agency told me, you know, he would always say, why can't
*  we run this like an assembly line?
*  We need to be more efficient.
*  Henry Ford would never have gotten rich if he had run his assembly lines like this.
*  And I was very skeptical.
*  I mean, that's a really intense thing to say when you're talking about the most vulnerable
*  children in this country.
*  But somebody eventually leaked us a video of him sort of berating staff and saying that
*  on tape.
*  So I think he himself is probably under a lot of pressure, but there's a lot of disappointment
*  within the agency and among immigration advocates about how that's been handled.
*  Hannah, I'd like to ask you about the children.
*  If you could tell us some of their stories.
*  That's really the heart of your story.
*  As you talk about Christian, who works in a construction job instead of going to school,
*  14 years old, Carolina, who packages Cheerios at night in a factory, talk about each of
*  them and also how you found them.
*  How difficult was it for you to find them?
*  I mean, these kids were not hard to find, and I think that's part of what you're
*  seeing with these Department of Labor reforms.
*  Inspectors just have not been looking for them in a proactive way.
*  I came to—I went to different cities and towns, and usually the next day I already
*  was speaking to children who were working these illegal, exploitative jobs.
*  I talked to Christian in southern Florida.
*  He was living in a house full of other unaccompanied minors, other kids who had come across the
*  border without their parents.
*  All of them were working full-time.
*  None of them had gone to school.
*  Christian had come when he was 12, two years ago, and immediately, the next day, started
*  working full-time in construction.
*  He told me that he doesn't know how to read and he would like to learn English, he would
*  like to learn how to read, but he can't go to school because he has a debt to pay
*  off, he has to pay rent.
*  And I went to a construction site and talked to him as he was putting the roof on a building.
*  And he told me he had already fallen twice that year.
*  He was working with power tools.
*  He was just sort of balancing precariously on the edge as he was trying to bend some
*  rebar.
*  And I mean, he's a child.
*  It's not what he wants to be doing, but he was released to this situation, and there's
*  just sort of no support there for him to get out of it.
*  And in Michigan, I talked to a lot of children who were working in a factory packaging Cheerios.
*  They also packaged Lucky Charms and Cheetos.
*  And these were kids who were in school.
*  I met them at school.
*  And some of the kids I met at school told me, oh, yeah, we have to leave early now,
*  because we have to go to our factory job.
*  And I was just shocked.
*  But I went to this factory, and sure enough, there they were, walking out after the shift.
*  And this is a place where you're working with really industrial machinery.
*  The machines have sliced off people's fingers.
*  One woman who was doing this kind of work was pulled in by a hairnet, and her scalp
*  was ripped open.
*  I mean, it's a serious adult kind of place to work.
*  And these kids are balancing it with, you know, seven days of school as well.
*  So they're exhausted.
*  And tell us about Neri Katsal from Guatemala, how they met their sponsor.
*  Again, these children are here legally.
*  And then talk about the children who have died.
*  I mean, I think that's such an important point.
*  These are not undocumented children.
*  They're not children who snuck in and nobody ever found out about them, and now they're
*  sort of living a subterranean life.
*  These are children who turned themselves in at the border, usually asked for asylum,
*  and were released to live with somebody who the government thought would protect them.
*  The government can't release them unless they're sure that it's a trustworthy adult
*  who is taking these kids on.
*  And in some cases, they're being released to complete strangers.
*  So in Neri's case, he met a man on Facebook when he was 13.
*  The man said that if he wanted to come to the U.S., he would help him, he would let
*  him go to school.
*  And instead, Neri shows up, the man picks him up from the airport and immediately hands
*  him a list of debts that this kid now has.
*  So he's charging him thousands of dollars for his journey to this country.
*  He charged him for filling out the paperwork that he had to send to the government in order
*  to get him released.
*  He charged him $45 for the dinner of tacos that they had that night.
*  And then he told Neri that he had to go find his own place to live, find a job and start
*  paying back this debt.
*  And, you know, Neri doesn't speak any English.
*  He's never worked.
*  He was in school, and he was in Central America.
*  And we've seen the text messages between him and this man.
*  The man starts threatening him and saying, You don't matter to me.
*  I'm going to mess you up.
*  He threatened Neri's family.
*  And these kids are just on their own in these situations, which—with, you know, very little
*  resources and very few ways out.
*  You mentioned that federal inspectors just generally are not looking for these kinds
*  of violations.
*  But, Mitt, I'm sure that several of these workplaces that you went to were unionized
*  to one degree or another.
*  Is there any sense on your part that the organized labor movement was—that leaders in some
*  of these places were aware of this?
*  Because they could certainly complain and therefore trigger some kind of an inspection.
*  So, many of these children are coming in through staffing agencies.
*  I had initially thought that the unions would be a really important resource in this reporting.
*  And when I went to them, they told me, No, there's no children here.
*  You know, we have these other sort of workplace issues.
*  But then, in some cases, I would go back to the same workplace and see children on the
*  night shift.
*  And I think part of what's going on here is there are sort of two labor streams.
*  There are the official employees, and those are people who have to provide government
*  IDs.
*  There's more regulation and protection.
*  And then there are these kids who come in through the staffing agencies.
*  And that's like a total free-for-all, where the staffing agencies—people who work at
*  the staffing agencies have told us that they know they're sending children to work at
*  these factories.
*  People who sent children to work packaging Cheerios say they knowingly did this and that
*  the factory knowingly accepted these kids.
*  But because there's sort of this one layer of remove, the factories don't get in trouble.
*  It's the staffing agencies that get in trouble when there's a crackdown.
*  And the children who've died, Hannah?
*  I mean, child labor laws exist for a reason.
*  They're not just there because kids should go to school and they should get enough sleep.
*  They're really there because this work is dangerous.
*  Kids are much more likely to get injured on the job.
*  And they're supposed to protect kids' physical safety.
*  So what we found, talking to these kids who are working jobs that they're not supposed
*  are illegal for children, is that the rate of injury is extremely high.
*  And in some cases, children have died days after being released to a sponsor.
*  In one case in Alabama, a 15-year-old fell 50 feet off of a warehouse where he was helping
*  replace a roof.
*  It was his first day on the job.
*  He had been released to his brother.
*  Here in Brooklyn, where I live, a 14-year-old was killed on his bike.
*  He was a food delivery worker.
*  And he was living in a house full of strangers, trying to send money back to his family and
*  was hit by a car.
*  Another case that really struck me was a 16-year-old who died when he fell out of an earth mover
*  that he was driving.
*  And to me, the idea that a 16-year-old would be in a position to be driving a 35-ton vehicle
*  is just inconceivable.
*  But this is what happens when you have kids working the jobs that, for almost a century,
*  they've been specifically prohibited from being in.
*  I want to bring Greg Chen into this conversation.
*  Hannah Dreyer, who we're talking to, is the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter
*  who did this just jaw-dropping exposé, alone and exploited.
*  Gregory Chen is the senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers
*  Association.
*  Can you talk about legally what recourse these children have?
*  Thank you so much for having me on the show here.
*  And this is an extremely challenging situation.
*  And when you use the word legally what recourse these children have, the first thing that
*  comes to mind for me as a practicing lawyer who represented children back in the 1990s
*  in San Francisco is that children don't have any knowledge or understanding of what their
*  legal rights are.
*  Many of these children who are coming from different countries have very limited English-speaking
*  capacity or skills, and they simply won't understand that there is a legal system of
*  labor laws to protect them.
*  And they are also afraid that their immigration status here in the United States is going
*  to be in jeopardy if they report any such violations.
*  I wanted to ask you, in terms of the response of the Biden administration, this is certainly
*  one of the fastest responses by a government agency to an exposé that I can recall.
*  Your sense of what some of the proposals are of the Biden administration to address this
*  issue?
*  So, the announcements by the Biden administration are laudable in terms of the speed that they've
*  implemented them or that they've announced them.
*  By and large, what they're talking about here is increasing Department of Labor and
*  Health and Human Services investigations of these kinds of situations and also improving
*  the screening and vetting of families that might sponsor these children, usually relatives
*  who are going to take care of the children after they are released from government custody,
*  which happens when they first arrive.
*  And then in addition, after these children are released, what kinds of post-release services
*  are going to be given to these children to make sure to check on them so that after a
*  month or three months, are they still living there?
*  What is their health situation?
*  Are they going to school?
*  Those are all steps that the federal government has announced they will be doing more of because
*  they haven't been able to check on all these families.
*  What is missing here, and this is very important given the fact that, as Hannah described,
*  and what we're seeing statistically is that the number of children coming to the United
*  States, particularly from Central American countries, has increased dramatically.
*  About 10 years ago, we had 13,000, 14,000 children coming every year.
*  Now we are looking at 130,000 children that came just last year.
*  And these are children who are fleeing persecution, violence and poverty.
*  And many of them are afraid to come to the United States because of the challenges across
*  the border and because the United States has made it much more difficult to seek asylum.
*  And when they get here, if they don't have stable humanitarian legal relief, such as asylum,
*  they're going to be afraid to report anything bad that happens to them while here in the U.S.,
*  including labor violations.
*  So what the Department of Homeland Security needs to do and the Biden administration needs to do
*  is to look at more ways of ensuring asylum access and humanitarian protection for children
*  and for other people who are coming here seeking protection.
*  And just briefly, because we have less than a minute on this segment, but I wanted to ask
*  you in terms of the penalties that employers of the staffing agencies face.
*  Just last week, the Department of Labor found a company called Packer Sanitation Services,
*  guilty of having 102 children as young as 13 years old working across eight states,
*  and it only got a one and a half million dollar fine for that.
*  Yeah, so the important thing here is that we need more resources put into investigations
*  to ensure that fines and any other penalties can be imposed and that Congress should be looking
*  at this from a labor perspective. But I would also urge Congress to look at reforming our U.S.
*  asylum laws and our U.S. immigration system overall. The fact is that the asylum system
*  is closing. It's becoming more restrictive, both because of congressional pressure and because the
*  Biden administration is putting more blocks on asylum seekers being able to come here.
*  And we haven't had Congress reform our humanitarian or our family or employment-based
*  visa system in three decades now. That's 30 years where people who are coming here don't have
*  the pathways needed to have a safe, stable life here in the United States. And we have
*  thousands, millions of people who are living here, including children,
*  who are in that tenuous status. Anybody who is in a tenuous status that doesn't have permanent legal
*  status is going to be fearful of reporting labor violations like this. And that vulnerable,
*  second-class population in the United States is not something that's healthy for the country,
*  even as immigrants contribute so much to our society, our communities and our economy.
*  Well, we want to thank you both so much for being with us. Gregory Chen with the American
*  Immigration Lawyers Association and Hannah Dreyer for your superb expose in The New York Times.
*  We'll link to your piece, Alone and Exploited. And just to read a few lines from that piece to
*  underscore, when HHS checks on all minors by calling them a month after they begin living
*  with their sponsors, data obtained by the Times showed over the last two years the agency could
*  not reach more than 85,000 children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third
*  of migrant children.
