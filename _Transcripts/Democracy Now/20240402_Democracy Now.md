# Top U.S. & World Headlines — April 2, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-R201qlfcM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen has suspended aid operations in Gaza after
*  an Israeli airstrike killed six international workers from the charity and a Palestinian
*  driver.
*  The aid workers were struck after they left a warehouse in Deir Ebala, where they had
*  more than 100 tons of food aid that had been brought into Gaza by ship from Cyprus.
*  The aid workers were driving in a clearly marked convoy branded with the charity's
*  logo.
*  World Central Kitchen said the attack occurred even though they'd coordinated in advance
*  with the Israeli military.
*  Aaron Gore, the CEO of World Central Kitchen, said, quote,
*  This is not only an attack against WCK.
*  This is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations
*  where food is being used as a weapon of war.
*  This is unforgivable, unquote.
*  Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israel carried out
*  the attack, saying, quote,
*  the last day there was a tragic incident of an unintended strike of our forces on innocent
*  people in the Gaza Strip, he said.
*  The killed aid workers include three British nationals, an Australian, a Polish national
*  and an American-Canadian dual citizen.
*  Two of the aid workers were filmed inside Gaza prior to the attack.
*  Both of those aid workers are now dead.
*  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was shocked and saddened by the attack.
*  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also condemned the attack and demanded accountability
*  from Israel.
*  This is a human tragedy that should never have occurred that is completely unacceptable.
*  The official death toll in Gaza is now approaching 33,000 as Israel continues its assault and
*  defiance of last week's U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolution.
*  Israeli air strike killed four people, including two children.
*  Meanwhile, Reuters is reporting the Biden administration is considering a new $18 billion
*  arms package for Israel that would include dozens of F-15 aircraft.
*  This is in addition to the recent U.S. approval of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 500 500-pound
*  bombs as well as 25 F-35 fighter jets.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will ban the award-winning TV network
*  Al Jazeera after Israeli lawmakers passed a bill allowing for the temporary banning
*  of foreign broadcasters deemed to be a national security threat.
*  Al Jazeera is the most widely viewed network in the Arab world and is one of the few outlets
*  to have reporters inside Gaza.
*  Iran has vowed to retaliate after Israel bombed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria,
*  killing at least seven people, including three senior Iranian commanders and at least four
*  other Iranian officers.
*  The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll could be as high
*  as 11.
*  Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Al Quds Force, is said to be the highest-ranking
*  Iranian military officer to be killed since the U.S. assassinated General Qassem Soleimani
*  in Baghdad in 2020.
*  Iran's ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbar, condemned Israel for striking a diplomatic
*  building.
*  HOSSEIN AKBARI, Israeli Prime Minister We told you before, Zionist entity knows very
*  well that such crimes and any kind of crimes will not remain without response.
*  Primary elections are being held today in Wisconsin, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New
*  York, and Wisconsin activists are urging voters to cast their ballots for Uninstructed.
*  Inspired by Michigan's uncommitted campaign, Palestinian rights advocates, union members
*  and low-wage and immigrant workers have rallied behind the push to vote Uninstructed, an option
*  on Wisconsin ballots that allows delegates to make their picks at the party conventions
*  rather than selecting a preferred candidate at the polling site.
*  Here in New York, the Leave It Blank campaign similarly urges Democrats to voice their opposition
*  for Israel's assault on Gaza by withholding their vote and submitting a blank ballot.
*  The initiative is backed by the Working Families Party, If Not Now, Jewish Voice for Peace,
*  Empower Action, Sunrise Movement and other groups.
*  The Florida Supreme Court issued two critical decisions on abortion Monday.
*  In a major blow for abortion access across the southern United States, Florida's highest
*  court ruled abortion rights are not constitutionally protected, allowing a near total abortion
*  ban to go into effect.
*  The six-week ban provides exceptions for rape, incest, fatal, fetal anomalies and medical
*  emergencies.
*  But reproductive rights advocates hope the legislation will be short-lived since the
*  Florida Supreme Court also ruled Monday a referendum enshrining the right to an abortion
*  in the state's constitution can appear on the November ballot.
*  In Germany, a new law went into effect Monday legalizing the personal possession of up to
*  25 grams of cannabis.
*  It also allows individuals to cultivate up to three marijuana plants at home.
*  Cannabis will remain illegal for anyone under 18, as some health professionals warn the
*  new legislation could increase smoking among young people.
*  At midnight Monday, people gathered at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate for a smoke-in to celebrate.
*  If you really go into education instead of criminalization, and that's the right way
*  to go now, I think you can definitely bring awareness to it, because no matter what kind
*  of consumption it is, alcohol, marijuana, maybe other things too, the most important
*  thing is always safer use and harm reduction.
*  So always make yourself aware of what is actually a healthy dose.
*  The dose makes the poison.
*  Deadly violence continues to plague Haiti as armed groups and police trade more gunfire
*  overnight Monday in Port-au-Prince.
*  At least five people were killed.
*  I got a phone call this morning.
*  They told me that my father had died.
*  I was astonished.
*  And when I arrived, I saw him lying on the floor.
*  This spiraling political turmoil in Haiti appears to have no end in sight.
*  Recently resigned Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who remains locked out of Haiti by the armed
*  groups, raised questions this week over the constitutionality of a transitional council
*  which is being formed to serve as an interim governing body until elections are scheduled.
*  This comes as Canadian forces have been sent to Jamaica to train troops from Caribbean
*  nations to join the U.N.-authorized mission to Haiti.
*  Last week, the U.N. human rights chief called for an arms embargo on Haiti, calling the
*  situation there cataclysmic.
*  The majority of guns pouring into Haiti are smuggled in from Florida and other parts of
*  the United States.
*  New York Judge Juan Marchand expanded a gag order on Donald Trump Monday ahead of his
*  April 15th criminal hush money trial, barring Trump from attacking the judge's family
*  members.
*  Among other things, Trump called Marchand's daughter a quote, rabid Trump hater and shared
*  a photo of her on social media.
*  Meanwhile, Trump posted a $175 million bond in a civil fraud case Monday as he appeals
*  the $464 million judgment against him.
*  The bond is underwritten by the California-based Knight Specialty Insurance Company, the company's
*  owned by billionaire Don Hanke, who has been dubbed the king of subprime car loans and
*  is the largest shareholder in Axos Bank, which has provided financial services to Trump and
*  Jared Kushner's family businesses.
*  And the 2024 Izzy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Independent Media will be shared by In
*  These Times and journalists Mohammed El-Kurd, Lindsay Billing, Trina Reynolds-Thyler and
*  Sarah Conway.
*  The award this year recognizes reporting by In These Times on worker-centered economic
*  justice stories.
*  Mohammed El-Kurd is the nation's first-ever Palestine correspondent and wrote many things,
*  the right to speak for ourselves.
*  Lindsay Billing chronicled the American military's environmental devastation in Afghanistan for
*  Inside Climate News.
*  Trina Reynolds-Thyler and Sarah Conway produced the seven-part series Missing in Chicago,
*  which exposed police malpractice and the handling of missing persons cases disproportionately
*  affecting black women and girls.
*  And Democracy Now! is receiving special recognition for our coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza.
*  The Izzy Award is named for the dissident journalist I.F. Stone, that's Izzy Stone,
*  and is presented by the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now! co-host Juan González.
*  Hi Juan.
*  Hi Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  Thank you.
