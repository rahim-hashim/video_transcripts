# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 10, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5gwUDhFr-U)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's intensified its bombing and ground assault in central and southern Gaza.
*  Dozens of people were killed in overnight attacks, including in the so-called safe zone
*  of Rafa city.
*  In the occupied West Bank, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian
*  President Mahmoud Abbas and Ramallah today as protesters outside condemned the U.S. funding
*  and backing of Israel's devastating assault on Gaza, which has now killed over 23,000
*  Palestinians in just over three months.
*  On Tuesday, Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reaffirming the U.S.'s
*  unique bond with Israel, advocating for a regional resolution that, quote, "'includes
*  a pathway to a Palestinian state.'"
*  Blinken addressed reporters in Tel Aviv.
*  We want this war to end as soon as possible.
*  There's been far too much loss of life, far too much suffering.
*  But it's vital that Israel achieve its very legitimate objectives of ensuring that October
*  7th can never happen again.
*  In today's meetings, I was also crystal clear.
*  Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow.
*  They must not be pressed to leave Gaza.
*  Blinken also rejected South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court
*  of Justice, which starts Thursday, as meritless.
*  A staggering 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, over 85 percent of the territory's
*  population.
*  This is 8-year-old Abdel Jabir Mohammed Al-Farah in Khan Younis, who was forced to flee his
*  home with his father and younger brother.
*  We were living safely.
*  Now we are left in the streets.
*  No tent or anything.
*  We are staying in the street.
*  We have no place or anything.
*  I never saw bombing like this in my life.
*  I was in third grade.
*  I did not complete my school year.
*  This is something I never saw in my life.
*  The situation is very tragic.
*  We're asking all countries to send aid, open the Ra'afah border crossing, to get all the
*  aid in, to end the war, end this injustice against us.
*  Academics for Peace, a grassroots group of Israeli-American and Jewish-American scholars,
*  have released a petition with over 2,000 signatories, including five Nobel laureates, calling on
*  the U.S. to lead negotiations on an immediate ceasefire, a hostage prisoner exchange and
*  getting humanitarian aid to Gaza.
*  Academics for Peace write, quote,
*  The San Francisco Board of Supervisors Tuesday passed a resolution calling for a sustained
*  ceasefire in Gaza.
*  It's the latest municipality to call for a ceasefire, even as the U.S. government refuses
*  to do so.
*  Last week, Bridgeport became the first city in Connecticut to adopt such a measure, and
*  the Albany Common Council also approved a ceasefire resolution.
*  Meanwhile, protests continue against lawmakers who refuse to demand a ceasefire in an NTU
*  U.S. support for Israel's assault.
*  In Revere, Massachusetts, constituents of Democratic Whip Catherine Clark held a procession
*  carrying white bundles to represent the shrouded bodies of more than 9,000 children who've
*  been killed in Gaza.
*  The protest ended in front of Clark's home, where Palestinian-Americans delivered speeches.
*  This is Leah Kiley.
*  I will not appeal to your false sense of morality.
*  It is obvious that politicians like you only speak the language of power.
*  So hear me when I say this.
*  Do not underestimate our power.
*  We, your constituents, are your bosses.
*  And as people of conscience, we charge you, Representative Clark, with genocide.
*  Here in New York, constituents of Congressmember Elise Stefanik sent a letter urging the Republican
*  lawmaker to, quote, resign immediately for your aiding and abetting genocide of Palestinians
*  in Gaza by voting to send arms to the IDF to perpetuate the crime in violation of the
*  Genocide Convention, unquote.
*  Judges for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals expressed skepticism as they heard arguments
*  from Donald Trump's legal team Tuesday over his 2020 election subversion case.
*  Trump's lawyers claimed he should receive immunity from criminal charges, arguing a
*  president can only be charged with a crime if they've already been impeached and convicted
*  by Congress.
*  This is Judge Florence Pan questioning Attorney D. John Sauer as Trump looked on.
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival?
*  That's an official act in order to seal Team 6?
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the
*  criminal prosecution.
*  But if he weren't, there would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that?
*  Chief Justice's opinion in Marlborough against Madison and our Constitutional
*  Commission and the plain language of the impeachment judgment clause all clearly presuppose that
*  what the founders were concerned about was not a...
*  I asked you a yes or no question.
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution?
*  If he were impeached and convicted first.
*  Following the hearing, Donald Trump warned of Bedlam if the Justice Department's case
*  against him damages his chances at re-election.
*  Trump also warned he'd go after Biden if re-elected.
*  He has to be careful because that could happen to him also.
*  The next president, whoever that may be, has a statute of limitations that go back six
*  years.
*  That's a long time, Joe.
*  You have to be very careful.
*  Ecuador's president, Daniel Nuboa, on Tuesday declared a state of emergency an internal
*  armed conflict as drug trafficking violence continues to soar.
*  Nuboa's announcement came a day after one of Ecuador's most notorious drug lords escaped
*  from prison, and his hooded and armed men interrupted a live TV news broadcast taking
*  the staff hostage.
*  Nuboa designated at least 20 drug trafficking organizations as terrorist groups, authorizing
*  Ecuador's military to do whatever it takes to suppress the crime factions.
*  From this moment, all terrorist groups identified in the presidential decree is a military target.
*  The present and the future of our homeland is at stake, and any act of terror will make
*  us give in.
*  We will not step back nor negotiate.
*  Public good, justice and order can't ask for permission or bow their head in front
*  of terrorists.
*  Norwegian lawmakers voted 80 to 20 to allow deep sea mining despite widespread warnings
*  and condemnation from scientists, environmentalists, as well as the U.K. government and the European
*  Union.
*  Norway's government says seabed exploitation could help power an economy less reliant on
*  fossil fuels.
*  One of the Earth's remaining untouched habitats, the deep sea, contains raw materials including
*  cobalt, zinc and gold.
*  Under Norway's new plans, companies will have to apply for exploration licenses and
*  exploitation permits.
*  The Environmental Justice Foundation called the decision an irrevocable black mark on
*  Norway's reputation as a responsible ocean state, adding, quote,
*  We know so little about the deep ocean, but we know enough to be sure that mining it will
*  wipe out unique wildlife, disturb the world's largest carbon store and do nothing to speed
*  the transition to clean economies, unquote.
*  Last year was the hottest year on record.
*  The Pentagon has vowed to do better.
*  After Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's prostate cancer diagnosis was disclosed Tuesday, President
*  Biden received the news about the same time as the general public.
*  This comes after revelations Biden and top Pentagon officials were also kept in the dark
*  for several days about Austin's hospitalization last week following complications from the
*  treatment.
*  White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients ordered a review of Cabinet protocols for delegating
*  authority while some Republican lawmakers are calling for Austin to step down amidst
*  the mounting controversy.
*  Austin's doctors say he's expected to make a full recovery.
*  Here in New York City, the first group of migrant families have been evicted from their
*  temporary shelter as city officials begin to enforce a 60-day limit.
*  About 40 migrant families were forced to leave a hotel in Midtown Manhattan Tuesday where
*  many had been staying for over a year.
*  Some reapplied for access to shelter as they have nowhere else to go.
*  We're human beings and need to be relocated because we need a roof to stay under, even
*  more now that it's colder.
*  They should think about the kids.
*  I know it's not an obligation because they didn't ask us to come here, but if you see
*  what someone goes through for someone to arrive here, it is hard.
*  The time restriction was imposed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams in October, claiming
*  it was necessary to relieve the city's shelter system that he says has been overwhelmed by
*  the arrival of thousands of asylum seekers.
*  About 70,000 migrants are currently being temporarily housed in hotels, tent camps and
*  shelters for unhoused people.
*  New York City Comptroller, Rod Lander, rebuked Mayor Adams' claims.
*  Everybody at the row had a room.
*  We're kicking them out of their rooms.
*  You can't say we don't have room.
*  They're in rooms.
*  Do we need more money to provide more space?
*  Yes, but I've talked to dozens of churches and synagogues and mosques who want to provide
*  their space.
*  We need federal health, but we also need better management from City Hall and some basic compassion.
*  Meanwhile, another 500 migrant families were relocated from a massive South Brooklyn tent
*  camp to a nearby high school Tuesday night as heavy rains and winds hit the area.
*  The Floyd Bennett Field Camp is set up on an isolated former airplane runway off the
*  bay.
*  The Labor Department issued a final rule Tuesday extending benefits and other protections to
*  millions of hourly and low-wage gig workers.
*  The mover reverses a Trump-era rule and reclassifies independent contractors as employees, allowing
*  them to access minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment insurance and Social Security
*  benefits.
*  Janitors, home care workers, construction workers and truck drivers are among those
*  who stand to benefit from the change.
*  Businesses are expected to launch legal challenges and rideshare companies, Uber and Lyft, which
*  have been fighting the new policy, said they will not reclassify drivers, that the Labor
*  Department could move to force both companies to abide by the new rule.
*  And U.S. police forces killed over 1,200 people in 2023, making last year the deadly
*  for murders at the hands of law enforcement in at least a decade.
*  That's according to data from the group Mapping Police Violence, which showed an average
*  of about three people killed by police daily.
*  This includes the fatal beating of 29-year-old Black father Tyree Nichols in Memphis, who
*  died one year ago today after being assaulted by officers from the elite Scorpion unit during
*  a traffic stop.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
