# Kissinger at 100: New War Crimes Revealed in Secret Cambodia Bombing That Set Stage for Forever Wars
**Democracy Now!:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bXZy-TrKlw)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
*  Saturday will be the 100th birthday of Henry Kissinger.
*  He served as national security adviser and secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
*  Today, we look at Kissinger's ongoing influence on the national security state, as the United
*  States engages in declared and undeclared wars around the world.
*  Human rights advocates consider Kissinger a war criminal who has escaped accountability.
*  We begin with a damning new investigation by The Intercept on the secret U.S. bombing
*  of Cambodia that killed as many as 150,000 civilians that Kissinger authorized during
*  the U.S. war in Vietnam.
*  Reporter Nick Terris has revealed unreported mass killings after examining formerly classified
*  U.S. military documents and traveling to 12 remote Cambodian villages to interview more
*  than 75 witnesses and survivors of the U.S. attacks.
*  With this new piece, Nick Terris also publishes transcripts of Kissinger's phone calls that
*  show his key role in Cambodia and CIA records connecting Kissinger's actions to the growth
*  of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, the regime that massacred 2 million people from 1975 to 1979.
*  Nick Terris is a contributing writer for The Intercept.
*  His books include Kill Anything That Moves, the Real American War in Vietnam.
*  His news story is headlined Blood on His Hands.
*  Survivors of Kissinger's secret war in Cambodia reveal unreported mass killings.
*  Nick Terris, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  Why don't you lay out the scope of your investigation and its most stunning conclusions,
*  what you were most shocked by in this extensive report?
*  Thank you so much for having me on.
*  I think the key takeaway of this package of articles is that Henry Kissinger is responsible
*  for more civilian deaths in Cambodia than was previously known.
*  According to this exclusive archive of U.S. military documents that I assembled and also
*  interviews with Cambodian witnesses and survivors, as well as Americans who witnessed or took
*  part in these attacks, the archive offers previously unpublished, unreported, and also
*  underappreciated evidence of hundreds of civilian casualties that were kept secret during the
*  U.S. war in Cambodia, most of them from 1969 to 1973, the years that Henry Kissinger presided
*  over it.
*  And these remain almost entirely unknown to the American people today.
*  A key to this reporting was previously unpublished interviews with more than 75 Cambodian witnesses
*  and survivors of U.S. military attacks, and speaking with them revealed new details about
*  the long-term trauma borne by survivors of the American war there.
*  So taken together, this adds to the list of killings and crimes that Henry Kissinger should,
*  at this very late date in his life, be asked to answer for.
*  And, Nick, could you talk a little bit about the military documents you found?
*  In your articles, I was quite surprised to discover, although I guess it's been reported
*  previously, that Kissinger himself was taping or transcribing conversations that he had
*  with the president and other officials about the war in Cambodia.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  I wrote a short sidebar about this.
*  People know about Nixon's White House taping.
*  What really laid him low is in the Watergate scandal.
*  But most people don't realize that Kissinger was also taping all his phone conversations.
*  He had a group of aides that transcribed these.
*  Through these transcripts, you can see Kissinger's—how hands-on he was with his policies in Cambodia.
*  You can see him relaying orders from Nixon.
*  Some White House officials that I spoke with who were privy to these conversations at the
*  time were often worried that President Nixon was drunk during some of these conversations.
*  He was slurring his words and giving orders to—in one case that I focus on—attack
*  anything—or it was to send anything that flies on anything that moves in Cambodia.
*  Basically, it attacked everything with planes and helicopter gunships.
*  You can see the order come right from Nixon.
*  Nixon passed it down to his military aide, Alexander Haig.
*  Then I was able to show that you could see the palpable effects in the field, that just after
*  these orders came down, helicopter attacks on Cambodia went sky high.
*  They tripled over the course of the month after this call.
*  So you can really see the direct effects of Kissinger in the White House and how it affected
*  Cambodians on the ground.
*  AMY GOODMAN I want to start with your article—how you start your article in Cambodia.
*  At the end of a dusty path snaking through rice paddies lives a woman who survived multiple
*  U.S. airstrikes as a child, round-faced in just over five feet tall in plastic sandals.
*  Mares Lauren lost an older brother to a helicopter gunship attack and an uncle and cousins to
*  artillery fire.
*  For decades, one question haunted her.
*  I still wonder why those aircraft always attacked in this area.
*  Why did they drop bombs here?
*  Can you elaborate on this?
*  And I want to say, for our radio listeners, for television, we're showing photographs
*  that you have, an incredible goldmine of photographs that you took when you made these visits.
*  Talk about these details, the specific stories.
*  MICHAEL SHERWOOD Yes, you know, Mares Lauren's story and the suffering that she endured, the
*  trauma that she's lived with all these years, it, like so many of the stories that I heard in
*  Cambodia, really, really stuck with me.
*  And, you know, and her question was one that I heard again and again.
*  Cambodian villagers and these remote villages on the border with Vietnam, they had no idea why
*  they were attacked.
*  One day, American aircraft just started appearing overhead.
*  They had no frame of reference for why this was happening.
*  They didn't understand it, but they soon came to fear these machines.
*  And for years on end, they were terrorized by them.
*  I actually took her question to Henry Kissinger when I tried to confront him with questions for
*  this article.
*  And I asked him to answer the question that she had asked me, why did they attack here?
*  And Kissinger responded with sarcasm, anger, and stomped off.
*  He was able to beat an easy retreat and save himself from this questioning.
*  But Cambodians like me, Lauren, didn't have any sort of easy means of escape.
*  There was another village that I visited, and I have some photographs from that as well.
*  These were taken by my wife, Tam Terce, reported this along with me.
*  And there was a village that was mentioned in U.S. documents.
*  They mentioned an attack on May 1, 1970.
*  Helicopters circled a Cambodian village.
*  The Americans had a phonetic spelling of it called Moroan, but there was no village in
*  Cambodia called Moroan.
*  It's not a Cambodian name, but there was one called Moron on the border.
*  And we set about trying to find it.
*  We got close, and we spent two days driving around local roads asking for directions.
*  We finally turned off the highway onto a red dirt track that cut through some lush farmland.
*  It then ended with a footpath, and it took us into this village.
*  I quickly found the village chief, and I read him the excerpt from the documents that
*  during this attack, 12 villagers were killed, five were wounded.
*  This is from U.S. records.
*  And after the assault, survivors fled their village and they went to another one called
*  Khantut.
*  So when I asked him about this particular attack, it was like many Cambodian villages
*  that I visited.
*  He was baffled by it.
*  They'd endured so many airstrikes over the years, he couldn't remember one single strike,
*  but when he thought about the date, he told me that's right.
*  He gestured toward an area at the edge of the village and said they attacked intensely
*  at that time, and then everyone here fled for Khantut.
*  So I knew that we had the right place.
*  And this village chief, a man named Shan Hang, lost his mother, his father, his grandfather,
*  a nephew, a niece, and other more distant relatives to airstrikes.
*  He and several other survivors told me about relentless attacks.
*  And as he talked to me, his eyes reddened and then they went vacant.
*  And he sunk to his knees and moved to a far corner of the room.
*  And I let him be.
*  He eventually returned to the conversation.
*  But this was the type of trauma that I encountered again and again.
*  It had been decades, but this trauma wrought by Henry Kissinger's policies was still so
*  amazingly fresh and palpable in all of these villages.
*  And Nick, the U.S. bombing campaign and the war in Cambodia was followed obviously by
*  the rise of the Khmer Rouge and also the genocide that the rest of the world associates more with
*  Cambodia than anything else.
*  I'm wondering, you're reporting, what connection, if any, between this bombing,
*  this massive bombing campaign for which U.S. officials have never been held responsible,
*  and the rise of the Khmer Rouge?
*  Sure.
*  I mean, of course the Khmer Rouge is culpable for the genocide in Cambodia and the 2 million deaths.
*  But as you mentioned, it's been long overlooked just how destabilizing the U.S. bombing was.
*  There was such displacement of Cambodians within their own country, such trauma caused by
*  the U.S. attacks, these relentless attacks, and tremendous quantities of bombs dropped,
*  that the Khmer Rouge used all this as a recruiting tool.
*  They went around the villages and said that the only way to make this stop was to join
*  their movement, which before the U.S. bombing was really a small fringe movement of just
*  thousands of people.
*  By the end of the U.S. bombing, the Khmer Rouge numbered 200,000 people.
*  And I mean, the U.S. attacks were the centerpiece of their recruiting drive.
*  And it, you know, unfortunately, it worked all too well.
*  And so, you know, President Nixon and Henry Kissinger certainly played a key role
*  in enabling this genocide to happen.
*  In 2016, during an event at the LBJ Library, Henry Kissinger was asked to respond
*  to those who call him a war criminal.
*  I think the word war criminal should not be thrown around in the domestic debate.
*  It's a shameful—it's a reflection on the people who use it.
*  As Henry Kissinger turns 100 years old on Saturday, in addition to Nick Terce,
*  who's written this astounding series in The Intercept, headlined Blood on His Hands,
*  we're joined by the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Greg Grandin, author of the book
*  Kissinger's Shadow, the Long Reach of America's Most Controversial Statesmen.
*  Greg's latest article is headlined Henry Kissinger, a War Criminal Still at Large at 100.
*  Can you take off from where Nick Terce left off, Greg Grandin, and tell us how,
*  though so many have come under a microscope like Nixon and his whole group in the White House,
*  Kissinger somehow escaped this by the establishment media, though independent media has
*  long been fiercely critical of him. Tell us Kissinger's full story, Greg.
*  Well, it would take a lot more time than we have to tell Kissinger's full story,
*  as turning 100 years old. I think that what's interesting is that—I mean,
*  Kissinger is a war criminal, but there are lots of war criminals. I mean, the people who conducted,
*  as Jeff Sachs talked about, the Iraq War, you know, can be held culpable for the destruction of a
*  country and a legal war. What's interesting is that in some ways the crimes are ongoing. I mean,
*  you know, there's many, many unexploded ordinances in Laos and Cambodia that are still killing
*  people. So the crimes are not of the past, but they're the present. That said, I think that the
*  best way to think about Kissinger isn't necessarily as a war criminal. I think that in some ways that
*  shuts down debate. Kissinger as a personality is so oversized, he eclipses his context. I think
*  Kissinger is—Kissinger's life actually has a lot to teach us about how we got to the point where
*  we are, the way that, again, Jeff Sachs talked about this multifronted, never-ending, endless war
*  and military-industrial complex. Cambodia, the bombing of Cambodia was done in secret for five
*  years. It was a covert operation. People know that, but I don't think it was mentioned.
*  And the reason it had to be covert was because it was illegal. It was illegal to bomb. We weren't
*  at war with Cambodia. It wasn't a country that the United States had declared war on or was at
*  war with. And the reasons why, the excuses that Kissinger has given for a five-year-long bombing
*  campaign that caused enormous damage, including bringing to power the most eliminationist,
*  extremist cadre within the Khmer Rouge and leading to the genocide, was that it was to eliminate safe
*  havens. It was an act of self-defense. This is now taken as a common practice. This is basically,
*  fundamentally, what the entire U.S. war on terror is authorized to do, to go into any country and
*  drone and bomb and conduct military operations, some we know about, some we don't know about,
*  but as a matter of course. So we don't do it in secret. So Kissinger's trajectory from Cambodia,
*  from being the architect of this secret campaign to bomb a country the United States wasn't at war
*  with, to the state we are in now, governed by a national security state, is what I think is most
*  instructive about Kissinger's life and most important about him, other than describing him
*  as a war criminal, which he is. And Greg, why do you think that he remains such a significant
*  figure? As you mentioned, he escaped all of the scandal of the Nixon years and went on to be a
*  highly influential figure, not only in the actual political world, but obviously in the media as
*  well. He was always referred almost by the corporate press as a revered figure in American
*  foreign policy and national security. Yeah, the press loved him and he was very good at playing
*  the press, especially, he was very good at weathering Watergate. His fingers were all over,
*  he basically pushed Nixon to set up the plumbers because he was obsessed that Daniel Ellsberg,
*  who released the Pentagon Papers, had information about Cambodia. Cambodia threads through all of
*  this. And Kissinger was instrumental in pushing Nixon to set up the covert operation that went
*  into Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and went into the Watergate hotel because he wanted to
*  basically take down Ellsberg. And Kissinger survived that basically because he wasn't,
*  he wasn't a, he didn't seem like the thugs that Nixon had around him, you know, Haldeman and
*  Ehrlichman, the Prussians they were called. And the press really kind of fell for the gravitas that
*  he projected and they were looking for somebody that they could trust, that they can hang something
*  on and still have faith in the national, in the institution of the presidency, executive branch,
*  and Kissinger was very attuned to this. He played people like Ted Koppel very well. And then,
*  and then what's interesting about Kissinger, though, more than anything, we know about his
*  eight years in office. He was national security director and secretary of state under Nixon and
*  Ford for a full eight years, secretary of state for the last couple of those years. And, and we
*  know, we have, we have documents, we have, we have, you know, Kissinger has himself has released,
*  has declassified, has given his archive to Yale. But it's what, what happened after,
*  when he becomes a kind of sage pundit, a bipartisan pundit, Bill Clinton rehabilitates
*  Kissinger as a way of giving him a certain seriousness in foreign policy that as a
*  governor of Arkansas, he didn't have. So he rehabilitates him for the Democratic Party.
*  And then Kissinger founds, of course, Kissinger Associates. And so he's out of office now for what?
*  76 to now is, you know, half a day, 50 years. And, and, and, and during that time, he, his,
*  Kissinger Associates has been a kind of premier concierge service for the global elite. It's,
*  it's broken, basically broken the privatization of national industries in Latin America, in Eastern
*  Europe, in Russia. He's, he's a key player in all of these movements. We have no information about
*  any of that, right? And it's arguably more consequential in some ways. I mean, maybe not,
*  maybe, I guess, I guess the actual war crimes were, were when he was in office for eight years. But
*  there is this, there is this black hole of his role as, as, as a, as a consultant to the,
*  to the, to the global elite during this very consequential moment in which an enormous amount
*  of wealth transferred from, from the bottom to the top. And Kissinger was deeply involved.
*  And he helped Roke in Africa, for example. He told, he told Clinton that, that Clinton had
*  political capital to do only one of two things this first year. He could either
*  pass Hillary Clinton's national health program or he could push for NAFTA. And he advised him
*  to push for NAFTA, and Clinton did. And we got NAFTA and we didn't get a healthcare expansion,
*  which I think says a lot about, about the, the, the post-Cold War trajectory of the United States
*  and how we got to where we are now. I wanted to go quickly to the 2016 Democratic presidential
*  debate in Milwaukee when Senator Bernie Sanders criticized his opponent, Hillary Clinton's
*  relationship with her fellow former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and cited Kissinger's role
*  in Cambodia. In her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the
*  support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing because I happen to believe
*  that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the
*  modern history of this country. I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not
*  take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United
*  States bombed that country over through Prince Sino created the instability for Paul Pot in the
*  Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some three million innocent people, one of the worst
*  genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry
*  Kissinger. So that was presidential candidate Bernie Sanders versus presidential candidate Hillary
*  Clinton. And then you have the late celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain, who once said, once you've been
*  to Cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.
*  You'll never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating,
*  murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black tie
*  affair for a new glossy magazine without choking. Witness what Henry did in Cambodia, the fruits of
*  his genius for statesmanship. And you'll never under understand why he's not sitting in the dock
*  at the Hague next to Milosevic. Now, those were the words of Anthony Bourdain. And I want to get
*  your comment on this, Greg, and then Nick Terce. Yeah. Well, again, Cambodia, the centrality of
*  Cambodia in this transition, transitional period of the U.S. national security state and its
*  importance, you know, the human damage and costs and pain and suffering is overwhelming to think
*  about, but more kind of stepping back and thinking about its role in the kind of trajectory of U.S.
*  power. One thing we didn't talk about is Kissinger's role in the October surprise of 1968.
*  The New York Times just ran an article more or less confirming Reagan's role in the October surprise
*  regarding the Iranian hostages. But Kissinger, you know, Kissinger in the 1950s and 60s was a
*  Rockefeller Republican. He was like, he understood himself as a liberal Republican. And he was
*  shocked when Nixon got the nomination in 1968. He thought his political career was over. But then he
*  reached out to the Nixon campaign and he said, you know, I got contacts in the Johnson campaign.
*  I can let you know what's going on with the peace talks in Paris that were hoping to wind down the
*  war and might have brought you, given Humphrey the presidency. And Kissinger passed on information
*  that the Nixon campaign then used to scuttle those talks. And then once he was appointed,
*  he was awarded with that by being appointed national security advisor. And then once he
*  came into office, he had to figure out a way to restart the peace talks because Nixon promised to
*  end the war. So what can you do? You just scuttle the peace talks. How do you restart them? Well,
*  not the stated justifications, but one of the reasons why he started bombing Cambodia and
*  became obsessed about Cambodia was he was trying to kind of project a certain kind of madman theory
*  to the North Vietnamese, that the Nixon administration was so crazy they would start
*  bombing Cambodia and maybe this would bring them back to the negotiating tables. And of course,
*  it didn't. And the war dragged out for another five years for no reason. It could have ended in
*  1968. It could have ended, you know, and then millions of lives were lost in the Vietnamese,
*  tens of thousands of lives were lost in the United States, all as a result of this moment,
*  this first October surprise in 1968. And again, Cambodia playing a central role in that history.
*  Nick Terz, we just have a minute and we want to give you the last word after this massive
*  investigation you've done and documents you've uncovered and people's voices that haven't been
*  heard before. Yes, and I wanted to bring it back to the Anthony Bourdain quote and just offer up
*  one case that I chronicle. And this is from the U.S. records. Americans shot up a village
*  with helicopters using machine gun fire rockets. And then South Vietnamese forces,
*  an American officer landed. They began looting this village. An American officer stole a Suzuki
*  motorbike and hauled it onto this helicopter. Other Americans noticed that there was a young
*  Cambodian girl, maybe five years old, who was shot and bleeding, lying on the ground. They wanted
*  to take her for medical care. But the officer who dragged the motorbike on board said negative. They
*  were weighed down by the bike and they had no room. And they left this girl there to die. This
*  happened after Henry Kissinger gave that order to anything that flies and anything that moves. So
*  this is Henry Kissinger's legacy. And this is what Anthony Bourdain was talking about.
*  Intercept reporter Nick Terce will link to your four-part series, including The Peace,
*  Blood on His Hands, Survivors of Kissinger's Secret War in Cambodia Reveal Unreported Mass
*  Killings. And we want to thank Yale University Professor Greg Grandin, author of the book
*  Kissinger's Shadow. We'll link to your new article, Henry Kissinger, a War Criminal Still
*  Large at 100. I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
