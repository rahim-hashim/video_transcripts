“I never expected the world will know my name [because of] a genocide of my people,” says Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza, who gained international acclaim for his work during the first 108 days of Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza. Since evacuating in January, Azaiza has brought his advocacy for Palestinian rights around the world. Democracy Now! speaks to him from Washington, D.C., where he has just wrapped up a nationwide speaking tour titled “Gaza Through My Lens” in support of UNRWA USA. “Israel is targeting our children. Israel is targeting our babies, targeting our mothers, targeting our families. I just want to show the whole world so maybe I can bring help to my people through my photography,” Azaiza says.

# Motaz Azaiza, Acclaimed Journalist from Gaza, on Photographing War & Making “Art from the Pain”
**Democracy Now:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AhAo2XsTWQ)
*  This news is funded by viewers like you.
*  Please support our work at democracynow.org.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
*  We're joined now by the acclaimed Palestinian photographer, Motaaz Azeezah, who, at the
*  age of 25, has become world-known for documenting Gaza.
*  For the first 108 days of Israel's brutal assault on Gaza, Azeezah risked his life to
*  show the world what was happening.
*  In doing so, he gained over 17 million Instagram followers and emerged as one of the most prominent
*  photojournalists in the world.
*  Since evacuating, Azeezah has become a global advocate for Gaza.
*  GQ Middle East Magazine named Azeezah its Man of the Year.
*  Time put him on its list of 100 Most Influential People of 2024, and he's been nominated for
*  the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.
*  Motaaz Azeezah is in the United States as part of a nationwide speaking tour titled
*  Gaza Through My Lens with Innerwah USA, the nonprofit that supports the United Nations
*  Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.
*  In a moment, he'll join us from Washington, D.C.
*  But this is the video produced by Innerwah USA describing Motaaz's work with the agency.
*  The clip begins with Innerwah USA's Mara Kronenfeld, but first, Leila Mochaibur.
*  Gaza is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and that beauty was documented
*  by a young photographer named Motaaz Azeezah for years.
*  Here to show the world his culture, his people, its rainbows, its sunsets, its sea.
*  Even with this blockade, there was so much life in Gaza, and we thought we need somebody
*  on the ground who can show us that life, and also, of course, can show us the important
*  education and health and shelter assistance that Innerwah is providing to those in Gaza.
*  When I eventually was looking for a photographer on the ground to capture stories, to help
*  show the people of the United States the real stories of Palestine refugees, I convened
*  some of Gaza's greatest around a table at Al-Dida Hotel, a place I'll forever cherish
*  and miss.
*  Among us were the late Dr. Reshata Al-Ahir and others.
*  Leila collected many applications.
*  One was a lovely woman in Amjad, and one was Motaaz.
*  That day that those two were selected changed us in so many ways as an organization, and
*  frankly changed us each personally as well.
*  Seeing Motaaz suffer along with all Palestinians in Gaza and see him, I'll never forget this,
*  seeing him holding a bloodied child, a girl, and taking her speeding to the hospital, and
*  he had never learned to drive before that moment.
*  Nobody in Gaza and all of Palestine chooses to be in Europe.
*  This includes Motaaz.
*  Once I asked him over ice cream, what is the number one thing you wish the world knew about
*  Gaza?
*  And this nerdy photographer, whose favorite thing was capturing people's faces in pretty
*  sunsets, he just had this sad look in his eye, and he said that we're human.
*  He never wanted to be a hero.
*  He just wanted to survive.
*  A video by Unirwa USA about our next guest, the acclaimed Palestinian photographer Motaaz
*  Aziza.
*  He's joining us now from Washington, D.C.
*  Motaaz, it's great to have you with us on Democracy Now!
*  I wanted to go to the picture of—that introduces you on that tour that you took across the
*  United States.
*  You're sitting in the rubble.
*  So of course, this is not a photograph that you took, but a picture that a photographer
*  took of you, the photographer Fuad, who was killed.
*  Can you tell us about Fuad and then talk about your work for that 108 days in Gaza since
*  October 7th?
*  Thank you for having me, Amy.
*  His name is Fuad al-Kharnash, and he was a volunteer with the Palestinian-Arabic Christian
*  Society.
*  He was doing his voluntary work, documenting the work of the BRCS on the ground, saving
*  lives and transferring the injured people to the hospital.
*  He was a dreamer, and on that date, it was like a massacre when he took this picture
*  for me in my town.
*  I was documenting this massacre, and he just shouted to me, Motaaz, just, I'll take a
*  picture of you.
*  Less than two months, Fuad was killed, beside his, like, four of his colleagues in the BRCS.
*  They didn't know that the Israeli tanks would be on Salah al-Din main road in Nair
*  al-Bala city.
*  They didn't expect it, and they just found the Israeli tank in front of them, and it
*  he was inside the ambulance.
*  Unfortunately, we couldn't find a body for Fuad and other colleagues.
*  Yeah, they opened fire on the ambulance.
*  They killed everyone inside.
*  So, Motaaz, I want to go now to another photo of yours.
*  This one is of a young girl stuck under rubble after her eight-story building was bombed
*  by Israeli warplanes.
*  The Israeli magazine named it one of its top 10 photos of 2023.
*  The woman lost seven of her family members.
*  She was evacuated to Tunisia.
*  She's now facing the amputation of her leg.
*  So, tell us about this woman and how you've come to advocate for her.
*  Actually, she's a young girl.
*  She's now 18 years old.
*  And there was, like, an Israeli occupation bomb the eight-story building in the Sayerat
*  refugee camp.
*  So, I was there with other colleagues documenting what's happening, and civil defense, beside
*  civilians, trying to help to save people from under the rubble.
*  More than 180 people got killed that day.
*  In this moment, we were, like, hearing her shouting, but nobody was seeing her.
*  So, I used the low shutter speed with my camera in a small hole so we can't find her.
*  And we found her.
*  Everyone's trying to get her out.
*  But unfortunately, she's now really facing amputation for her leg.
*  Let's say I feel she's—at least she's lucky that the world now sees her picture.
*  Everyone, like, saw his picture around the world, but there are others, thousands of
*  children, thousands of young girls, thousands of women, thousands of elderly.
*  Nobody is looking to them, and they really need help.
*  So I'm trying my best through the pictures, through the images of the people, to help
*  them themselves, because, yeah, this picture had been selected by the time as one of the
*  top 10 pictures around the world for 2023.
*  But the person in the picture needs the help, not just like I want to be recognized for
*  the picture.
*  We need to help the human themselves.
*  I want to save the lives through the pictures.
*  So, Mataz, I want to ask you about your journey, how you became a photographer.
*  You never wanted to become a war photographer.
*  That is what you've ended up becoming.
*  So talk to us about how you became interested in photography and how you documented life
*  in Gaza through photography.
*  Photography was my passion since 2014.
*  I started to practice photography.
*  I had my first camera in 2015.
*  My cousin sent it to me.
*  He was living in the U.S., Miami.
*  I hope he's now safe for the hurricanes that are happening there.
*  I hope everyone will be safe.
*  I started to take pictures for the life, the symbol life in Gaza.
*  I started to take portraits.
*  I started to be a dreamer who wanted to travel the world, take pictures, and everyone knows
*  his name.
*  But I never expected the world would know my name, besides a genocide of my people.
*  So I was always trying to make art from the being and the beautiful pictures in a place
*  that, like, every month there is aggression, every time there is a bombing, every time
*  there is people losing their lives by the Israeli airstrikes, by the Israeli snipers.
*  I was like a volunteer.
*  I went, like, since, like, 2016 with the BRCS.
*  I was having my camera.
*  In 2018, I got a shot in my left fume by taking just pictures, because I was near to the borders
*  with the BRCS, trying to save lives, because this is a thing I, like, I'm loving.
*  I'm trying to use myself to save my people and the same thing, to take pictures.
*  So I kept the packs and photography, but every time the war, it grabbed me to it.
*  I've been always trying to avoid taking pictures of war, but this is my life.
*  This is our lives.
*  So you can't run from the war that's happening in your home.
*  And this is what I did.
*  I used, in this time and every time—this is not my first time to document a war.
*  I documented massacres since, like, 2017 with my camera, and 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022,
*  2023 in May and 2023 on October.
*  So I've been always trying to take—to capture the beauty, but it's impossible to
*  run from the war in my country.
*  And, Mataz, I mean, the images before October and after are so striking.
*  I want to now show a photo of a toddler gravely injured in a strike.
*  If you can tell us what happened to this two-year-old child named Jude.
*  The Palestine Children's Relief Fund has evacuated him to Chicago.
*  You know, on your trip, you met a child in Dallas for the 5K run who'd been evacuated.
*  I saw you in Brooklyn when you met a little boy who had been evacuated who was gravely
*  injured.
*  Tell us about Jude.
*  I remember that day when I took the picture for Jude.
*  I used my imagination.
*  Like, every young boy, he's very much like to be like a Spider-Man.
*  But this boy was really deeply injured, and his hands and his legs were like—he can't
*  move.
*  And, like, I don't know, in this moment, I remember that this boy, he would be a lot
*  like Superman and Spider-Man.
*  But like, I saw, like, his image, like, the moves of, like, Spider-Man, but the same thing.
*  He's injured.
*  He can't move.
*  He lost his mom.
*  He lost his family.
*  His father, he didn't come to the hospital yet.
*  He was, like, alone on the ground.
*  There is no free space or space for him to find a bed in the hospital.
*  So I took this picture.
*  I shared the story.
*  And thank God, this picture, it was like a reason to save his life.
*  So he's now, like, getting treatment.
*  He's now in the U.S. with his father.
*  And I'm happy for him, but at the same time, I'm really sorry for the thousands of children
*  that I wish to take a picture for everyone to show the world that Israel is targeting
*  our children, Israel is targeting our babies, targeting our mothers, targeting our families.
*  I just want to show the whole world so maybe I can bring help to my people through my photography.
*  Amutaz, can you talk about what it was like for you yourself to have to flee Gaza?
*  Do you still have family there?
*  Describe your journey out.
*  Yeah, my whole family is there.
*  My whole world is there.
*  I'm originally from the city.
*  I'm originally from Gaza Strip.
*  So my whole family is still there.
*  It wasn't an option for me to leave.
*  It wasn't an option for me to stay.
*  In the last days before I leave, I've been suffering to find food, to find tents for,
*  like, in order for something to happen.
*  It's like at the end of my street.
*  And I was, like, suffering.
*  And I stopped doing my work, like, just to find water, to find food, to find diesel for
*  the car.
*  So everything was really complicated.
*  And the risk is so high.
*  After I lost two of my colleagues, Hamza al-Dahduh, the son of Wahid al-Dahduh, and Mustafa Abou
*  Tariya, the drone friend who was taking the drone shots for me, it was really hard for
*  me to stay, and there was no protection for me as a journalist.
*  And I don't want to lose, like, a part of my body to just show the world and to lose
*  my life, to lose my parents.
*  And I already lost 25 of my family, of my relatives, 18 of my friends.
*  I lost my whole life.
*  So I don't think—I don't think that they are like, I need to lose more.
*  For me, okay, maybe I will sacrifice my life if to do a change.
*  But I'm seeing more than 175 heroes got killed in front of the whole world and nothing
*  changed.
*  So—and I got refused by Israel to leave twice.
*  It wasn't easy.
*  And I thought maybe when I will go out, I will make more changes, I will do something
*  more on the ground to be between the people.
*  And here I am.
*  It's been a year I'm trying to do something to stop this, or at least to protect the civilians.
*  And Mataz, as we talked about this week and that moment that was so moving of you taking
*  off your press flack jacket with your colleagues around you, taking off the jacket with you
*  as a kind of communal effort when you left with your parents and siblings, ultimately,
*  Gaza?
*  I wish I took the jacket with me.
*  It wasn't allowed because it's like—and the borders, you believe, it's a kind of
*  armor, so you can't take it.
*  But it was a thing that I—from day one with me.
*  It wasn't going to protect me if some Israel decided to target me with, like, drones or
*  snipers.
*  You had gotten calls on your phone, Mataz?
*  Yeah.
*  Explain that.
*  Yeah, it was a call from—calls from no caller ID, but it's now—for Gazans, no caller
*  ID didn't mean the IDF, so—or the IOF.
*  So, yeah, they were, like, asking me to not go there, ordering me, like, to not go there,
*  to not, OK, show something else.
*  Don't go to this area, and you will be killed if you aren't there.
*  Stick to the sea.
*  You're not doing the right work.
*  You should do something else.
*  And I believe the millions of the people who followed me, this made some protection for
*  Mataz, that the whole world is watching him.
*  And if something happened, it's in front of the millions of the people.
*  So I felt that maybe the millions that made them speak to me in a way that's not just,
*  OK, we will kill you or do something for you.
*  And, Mataz, finally, you went earlier this year in April to the pro-Palestinian student
*  encampment at Columbia University.
*  Your response to the protests and what you'd like to see happen here?
*  I would like to see everyone standing for us, standing for the humanity, standing for
*  the right of Palestinians in the land.
*  I want to see the white people, the black people, everyone here in the U.S. standing
*  for the right, on the right side of the history.
*  I want to see everyone just standing for humanity.
*  Stop watching us being killed.
*  Stop paying your taxes and sending for Israel as weapons to kill the Palestinians who even
*  don't have an army.
*  So just support us to get our right in our land, to get our free Palestine.
*  It's not hard.
*  It can be done, but we need a real stand with Palestinians, people.
*  Mataz Hezeza, we want to thank you so much for being with us, a claim Palestinian photographer
*  who documented the first 108 days of Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Thank you so much for joining us from Washington, D.C.
