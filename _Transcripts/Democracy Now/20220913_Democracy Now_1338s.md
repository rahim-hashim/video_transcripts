# Jamaica, Antigua & Barbuda May Cut Ties to British Monarch; Renew Call for Reparations for Slavery
**Democracy Now!:** [September 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V15N0A-Rx88)
*  King Charles III addresses the British parliament for the first time as monarch.
*  We begin today's show looking at the legacy of British colonialism in the Caribbean, where
*  there are growing calls for reparations.
*  The Caribbean at one point formed the heart of England's first colonial empire in North
*  America.
*  Many of the more than 2.5 million enslaved Africans taken to the British Caribbean were
*  worked to death.
*  The string of island nations includes Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda,
*  and Trinidad and Tobago, among many others now in the British Commonwealth.
*  Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the prime minister of the twin island nation,
*  Antigua and Barbuda, said voters may soon decide whether to leave the Commonwealth and
*  become a republic.
*  Prime Minister Gaston Brown spoke to ITV News after he confirmed Charles III as king
*  This is not an act of hostility or any difference between Antigua and Barbuda and the monarchy,
*  but it is the final step, as I said before, to complete that circle of independence to
*  ensure that we are truly a sovereign nation.
*  What sort of timeframe would you think on a referendum then?
*  So I'd say within the next probably three years.
*  This comes after Barbados voted last year to break from its colonial past and become
*  a republic.
*  Meanwhile, in Jamaica, the ruling Labour Party says it also plans to hold a referendum on
*  becoming a republic.
*  For more, we're joined in Kingston, Jamaica, by the renowned Jamaican dub poet Muta Baruca,
*  who's also a musician, radio show host as well.
*  And in St. John's, Antigua, Dobrine Omer is with us, the chairperson of the Antigua
*  and Barbuda Reparations Commission, also an ambassador-at-large of Antigua.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  Dobrine Omer, let's begin with you.
*  With the death of the queen, first your response and then what you're calling for for your
*  country.
*  Well, it's good to be here.
*  Let me say thanks for having me.
*  In terms of my response, I will be very measured here.
*  I will recognize that we are talking about debt.
*  We are talking about the loss of human life and that the queen would have had family,
*  et cetera.
*  But I'm under no obligation, I think, to be mourning her death.
*  And that is simply because of, I think, my understanding of history, my understanding
*  of the relationship of the British monarchy to African people and Asian people, but to
*  African people certainly on the continent and here in the Caribbean.
*  And so that my response is perhaps to recognize the role that the queen, Queen Elizabeth II,
*  has played, how she has managed to cloak the historical brutality of empire in this, in
*  this veneer of grandeur and pomp and pageantry, I guess, graciousness.
*  But I think that at this point in time, we need to examine that history a lot more closely.
*  And speaking of that history, could you, for those people who are not aware, especially
*  of the roles of King Charles I and King Charles II in the Caribbean, and especially towards
*  your country, could you talk about that?
*  Well, if we look at the role of monarchy, so we are going back now, mid-17th century,
*  1600s, King Charles I was perhaps the monarch, I think, that opened the trade between Britain
*  and Africa.
*  That was originally gold, minerals, et cetera, that opened that trade up to human trafficking,
*  to the enslavement, to the movement of enslaved Africans.
*  King Charles II, who followed him, actually was responsible, along with his then cousin
*  who later became James I, totally responsible for, and responsible and ownership of the
*  Royal African Company that moved more Africans off of the continent into the Americas than
*  any other company in history.
*  So what we are talking about here is the involvement, the involvement of British monarchy in the
*  ownership and the operation of the transatlantic, I prefer to call it, of the European slave
*  trade, the movement of Africans into the Caribbean.
*  And so we now see this movement, and even before Charles I, we can be addressing Elizabeth
*  I, and we see this recurrence, of course, in the names that we are talking about.
*  And so we now supposedly should be mourning the death of Elizabeth II and welcoming Charles
*  III.
*  But we know them.
*  We know these Charleses, and we know these Elisabeths.
*  So there is virtually no mourning for me at this moment.
*  I'd also like to bring in Mutubaruka, the renowned Jamaican poet, musician.
*  Your response to the death of Queen Elizabeth and also of the British Empire's relationship
*  to Jamaica.
*  Good morning.
*  I am totally in agreement with the first speaker.
*  And I don't even want to go back into slavery because a lot of people claim that Queen Elizabeth
*  was not responsible for what her ancestors did.
*  She herself said that slavery was legal at the time, so she don't really recognize what
*  we in the Caribbean are talking about.
*  Now, we have to realize in 1952, that was when she ascended the throne of England.
*  And if you check the history between 1952 and now, you will see that even though slavery
*  was abolished, what we call it redefined slavery and called it colonialism.
*  And colonialism in this part of the world was represented by the throne of England.
*  So we're not really talking now about individual person.
*  We're talking about a corporation, an institution, which is called the Monarchy of England, that
*  has totally devastated a lot of the progress we could have made if it wasn't for this
*  what we call colonialism interpreted to us as slavery still.
*  Now, we have to remember in her time, there was the Ma-Ma uprising, which is a very interesting
*  case because she was actually named Queen of England when she was in Kenya.
*  And the cruel and wicked things that the British army did to the African people there cannot
*  be seen as just, okay, that is just something.
*  And she had never, never granted any sympathy or said anything that would say, well, you
*  know, she have a kind of art to what was taking place.
*  We look in South Africa, during the apartheid system, the British is part of that wicked
*  apartheid regime that devastated and killed thousands of Africans who was fighting for
*  right to be a person in South Africa.
*  And it was not, it was recently, even during the time of Mandela and with Mandela, that
*  we was told that they were still on the list of terrorist groups.
*  And even though England and this Queen was ruling at that time, there was no effort to
*  find out what is it they can do to alleviate the problems that confront African people
*  in this part of the world.
*  Now, we come to the Caribbean in this time.
*  The Caribbean has been devastated.
*  We know in history, one of the richest plantation owners, cane owners, was a man by the name
*  of William Beckford.
*  William Beckford got his riches and became one of the richest men in England in that
*  time.
*  And up to this day, when we recognize how much people died because of the institutionalized
*  slavery that they call colonialism, up to this day, the movement of our people, especially
*  in Jamaica now, where our constitution was given to us by England through the hands of
*  the so-called Bustamante and Norman Manley, who was recognized during that time in 1962
*  when Jamaica was supposed to be getting independent.
*  They went to England and they got a constitution that is now part and parcel of what Jamaicans
*  are supposed to live by.
*  And when we look at that constitution, it does not include ownership of land in Jamaica
*  by the people.
*  If you go into the courts of Jamaica, it says the Crown versus Tom Stroke or the Crown versus
*  John Tom.
*  That is what we have to face right now.
*  Now, when you recognize that Jamaica is supposed to be an independent country, most Jamaicans
*  say Jamaica is not independent, that even though people say it's not rich, it's not
*  really governing the country.
*  But the head of state is the governor general representing the Queen of England in an independent
*  country.
*  How the hell is that possible that you have an independent country that is the first lady
*  is the governor general's wife, not the prime minister's wife?
*  And they set and designed the constitution that way.
*  And these so-called, we call them bossy slaves, jacket and tie slaves, that they continue
*  to uphold and maintain that regime that has committed so much atrocities and crimes in
*  this century, in this time.
*  They have been committing it and still committing it.
*  And we don't see why we should now sit down and say, 12 days a morning, that to show how
*  backward and how, we'll call it the Stockholm syndrome, has grabbed our leaders in the Caribbean,
*  that here's a family that represent criminal activities for your ancestors.
*  And now you start to love them.
*  How is that possible?
*  How is that possible that we who know the history, is keep repeating the history?
*  We know what is taking place in this democratic, so-called democratic country that is still
*  honoring the most gruesome and cruel monarchy that ever exists.
*  And we know of it.
*  How can we now sit and say, we have 12 days of mourning.
*  12 days of mourning for what?
*  What we mourning that for?
*  Why we not mourning for the thousands and millions of people that died across the Atlantic
*  Ocean?
*  We not mourning for all the warriors of our time?
*  There's no DFR Taki.
*  There's no DFR Nani.
*  All of these people who died because they stand up and struggle to get out of the claws
*  of British colonialism.
*  We now sit and say, we must mourn.
*  I am not one of them who's mourning, and I can't talk for a lot of ruck of our high
*  British ancestry.
*  We don't sit and mourn in time.
*  Muta Baruka, I wanted to ask your response to Charles at the time, Prince Charles, just
*  a few weeks ago, praising the contribution of Jamaicans to British life as immeasurable
*  and a message commemorating Jamaica's 60 years of independence from the U.K.
*  Now, you have Jamaica also talking, like Antigua and Barbuda, of a referendum on complete
*  independence, on becoming a republic.
*  What would—what do you think the outcome of that will be?
*  And what would reparations and an apology look like to you, be adequate for you?
*  By the way, it's an honor to speak with you again after so many years having talked
*  to you in Brooklyn.
*  Those years, yes, yes, yes.
*  All right.
*  What he's saying is what we expect him to say.
*  Actions be glorious and words.
*  And if he is here now to do certain things, he must understand how we feel as African
*  people in this part of the world and what his family and ancestors did.
*  So to address the situation, it's not just to say why he feels bad about what is happening.
*  That is not apologizing, because he did that already.
*  He came to the Caribbean and said why he feels bad about what was happening.
*  We need somebody saying, look here, we see what happened and we was responsible for it
*  and we're sorry, I'm going to make amends.
*  And the amends come with what we call—what they call getting something going between
*  the governments of the different countries to facilitate reparations and repatriation.
*  Because we're not taking that out for those who desire to go back to Africa, because we
*  came to Jamaica not by free will, but by force.
*  Nobody asked to come to the Caribbean.
*  None of these Africans, at least my sister, never asked to come here.
*  So the Raka Farai community is crying out, say, reparation, repatriation, meaning that
*  those who desire us of going back to Africa must be able to do this without the argument
*  about commonwealth of nations, and that is really an ignorance.
*  There is no moving away from the Queen and the monarchy if the countries that claim that
*  the monarchy is one, but if you still in the commonwealth of nations that still bind you
*  to the same colonial system that you are trying to break free from.
*  There is no getting rid of the Queen or getting rid of the King and you're still in the commonwealth.
*  We as Jamaicans, there's a lot of grandfathers and those living today who fought in the Royal
*  Air Force during World War II and who went to England to build up England.
*  And what we hear now, first of all, Jamaicans have to have a visa to go to the so-called
*  motherland.
*  Jamaicans are not allowed to stay there at a certain length of time.
*  And now we have the Windrush people who just recently, we see that they're trying to send
*  back people who was in England for 60 years and have children at their house and everything.
*  They're sending them back to Jamaica.
*  That is one of the most racist things that I have ever seen in my lifetime.
*  Where you go to build a country.
*  Muta Baruka, I'd like to bring in on this issue of reparations, Dobrino Marde also.
*  If you could tell us in the letter that your commission submitted to the Royal Family,
*  what were some of the demands and how do you see reparations?
*  Certainly, the letter that we wrote, well, it would have been our second letter addressed
*  to British monarchs.
*  Earlier, I think maybe about a year or two before, Prince Harry was here.
*  And certainly this year, this year or last year, I'm getting lost within this Covid mess.
*  The other brother was also here, who is now, I guess, destined to be the next King of England.
*  And our letter simply said to them that we were very tired and rather insulted by the
*  approach of telling us things that we already knew.
*  That we knew that slavery was horrible.
*  They didn't have to tell us that.
*  That we knew that genocide was committed.
*  They didn't have to tell us that.
*  And our letter simply said to them, please, do not come here and insult us further by
*  saying things that the Tony Blair's have already said, that the old minister of foreign affairs
*  had come and addressed the parliament in Jamaica and looked at us as Caribbean people,
*  descendants of enslaved people, to tell us that we should forget it and just move on.
*  That just let's forget this, move on.
*  And that is essentially what we said in our letter.
*  Now, in response to the other part of your question of what does reparations look like for us,
*  what does this moment mean to us in the reparations struggle?
*  I think certainly that we ask in Britain to reassess its role in the intentional development
*  of Africa and this Caribbean.
*  Asking Britain to reassess its role in the genocide, in the plunder, in the violence
*  that it exerted on African people on the continent and here in the Caribbean.
*  That in reassessing this role, that it must understand clearly that the morality of the
*  situation, the ethics of the situation calls for repair.
*  And in that repair, we essentially are talking reparations, that you have committed crimes
*  against humanity and that there is a moral and an ethical demand that you acknowledge
*  these crimes and you do your best in the best way you can to make whole the holes that you
*  have really left in the history and in the lives of African people.
*  I'm a member of the Caricum reparations commission as chairperson of the Antigua and Barbuda
*  reparations commission and that commission has issued a ten point plan that defines for
*  the international community, defines for us here in the Caribbean how we see reparations.
*  The plan that we have issued is a development plan.
*  It's in contrast, let's say, to the legacy reparation plans that have been developed
*  elsewhere in the diaspora where individuals are identified as the recipient of reparations.
*  The Caricum reparations plan talks of development.
*  In the first instance, it identifies those areas in our development across this region
*  where the hurt of enslavement and genocide continues to exist and continues to impact
*  on the lives of Caribbean people today.
*  And we are saying that in that development plan that we are inviting, inviting, is the
*  word that I think we have to use at this point in time, Europe to sit at the table with us
*  to discuss this development plan addressing areas in education, in healthcare.
*  As Mutiparaka has just said, we include in that this whole question of repatriation of
*  those persons who want to go back to the continent.
*  Dobrine, we have 15 seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  We're talking psychological.
*  We're talking debt.
*  We're talking debt relief.
*  A number of issues within that 10-point plan.
