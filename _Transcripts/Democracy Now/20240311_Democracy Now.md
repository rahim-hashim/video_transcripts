# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 11, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01nsVh9InD0)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel is continuing to attack Gaza, as Palestinians mark the first day of Ramadan.
*  The death toll from Israel's five-month assault has topped 31,000.
*  Health officials in Gaza say at least 27 Palestinians have starved to death due to Israel's ongoing
*  blockade of aid deliveries.
*  Over the weekend, five Palestinians died in northern Gaza as a pallet of food aid crushed
*  them to death after a parachute failed to open.
*  The United States has begun shipping parts to build a temporary port off the coast of
*  Gaza to increase aid, following President Biden's announcement during his State of
*  the Union address last week.
*  But many groups say the plan will take too long and is insufficient to address the looming
*  famine in Gaza.
*  The head of Doctors Without Borders in the U.S. said, quote,
*  "...the U.S. plan for a temporary pier in Gaza to increase the flow of humanitarian
*  aid is a glaring distraction from the real problem, Israel's indiscriminate and disproportionate
*  military campaign and punishing siege," unquote.
*  Inside Gaza, Palestinians are struggling to find any food to eat.
*  I came here to buy, but I can't find anything to buy.
*  There's nothing.
*  There are no dates or milk or anything.
*  One can't find anything for their children.
*  How are we supposed to have sahur, the meal before the fast starts at dawn?
*  How are we supposed to have iftar, the meal that breaks the fast?
*  With canned goods?
*  All these canned goods are full of germs that infect the stomach.
*  We need vegetables and fruits to feed our children because they've weakened and died
*  from hunger.
*  During an interview on MSNBC, President Biden criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu by saying he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel.
*  He has a right to defend Israel, a right to continue to pursue Hamas, but he must, he
*  must, he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions
*  taken.
*  He's hurting, in my view, he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making
*  the rest of the world—it's contrary to what Israel stands for.
*  And I think it's a big mistake.
*  So I want to see a ceasefire.
*  In the same interview with MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart, Biden warned Netanyahu against invading
*  Ra'a, but he also vowed to keep arming Israel regardless of what Israel does in Gaza.
*  What is your red line with Prime Minister Netanyahu?
*  Do you have a red line?
*  For instance, would invasion of Ra'a, which you have urged him not to do, would that be
*  a red line?
*  It is a red line, but I'm never going to leave Israel.
*  The defense of Israel is still critical.
*  So there's no red line.
*  I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them.
*  They don't have—but there's red lines that if it crosses, it cannot have 30,000
*  more Palestinians dead.
*  Netanyahu responded by vowing to defy Biden's red line on Ra'a, saying, quote,
*  We'll go there.
*  We're not going to leave.
*  Caribbean leaders are holding an emergency meeting in Jamaica today to discuss the political
*  and humanitarian crisis in Haiti, where armed groups are attempting to force the resignation
*  of Haiti's unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who's long been a U.S. ally.
*  Henry has been stranded in Puerto Rico since last week, unable to return home as increasing
*  violence has left Haitians struggling to secure food and water.
*  Over the weekend, the U.S. flew a team of Marines into Haiti as the security situation
*  the U.S. Embassy deteriorated.
*  Non-essential staff at the embassy were airlifted out of Haiti.
*  We'll have more on Haiti after headlines.
*  Pope Francis has called on Ukraine to have the courage to wave the white flag and begin
*  negotiations with Russia.
*  The pope made the comment in an interview with the Swiss broadcaster RSI.
*  It is one interpretation.
*  It's true.
*  But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about
*  the people and has the courage of the white flag, of negotiating.
*  And today, you can negotiate with the help of the international powers.
*  There are some.
*  The word negotiate is a courageous word.
*  When you see that you are defeated, when things are not going well, you have to have the courage
*  to negotiate.
*  One may feel shame, but how many dead will the war end up with?
*  And it will end even worse.
*  One should negotiate in time.
*  Find a country that can be a mediator.
*  Central Ukrainian and European officials criticized the pope's call for negotiations.
*  In New York, former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández was found guilty of cocaine
*  trafficking after a two-week trial.
*  Federal prosecutors had accused Hernández of ruling the Central American country as
*  a narco state, accepting millions of dollars in bribes from drug traffickers in exchange
*  for protection.
*  Celebrations erupted following Friday's verdict.
*  This is a Honduran activist speaking outside Manhattan's federal courthouse.
*  The rotten political class we have has brought the country to total collapse, and everyone
*  we see here, this entire community thirsting for justice, is a clear example of a society
*  in total collapse that has been trampled on and sunk by corrupt politicians.
*  Hernández was arrested in February of 2022, less than a month after his presidential term
*  ended and extradited to the U.S. in April 2022.
*  He was a longtime U.S. ally.
*  His brother is already serving a life sentence in the U.S. for smuggling cocaine.
*  Juan Orlando Hernández faces life in prison as well.
*  We'll have more on the trial later in the show.
*  The Sudanese military has rejected U.N. calls for a truce in fighting with its rival Rapid
*  Support Forces during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
*  The RSF had said it welcomed the truce.
*  The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Friday urging an end to nearly one year of
*  fighting.
*  The U.N. also expressed grave concern over the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Sudan.
*  This is China's deputy U.N. ambassador speaking Friday.
*  The lives of all the people in the world are precious.
*  While adopting a resolution on a ceasefire during the month of Ramadan in Sudan, the
*  Security Council must not forget that the people of Gaza are still suffering under bombardment.
*  The international community must push forward for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the
*  conflict in Gaza to give the people some hope for survival and provide the basic security
*  necessary for all religious activities by the Muslims there.
*  In an interview with MSNBC, President Biden said he regrets using the word illegal during
*  his State of the Union to address a Venezuelan, to describe a Venezuelan immigrant accused
*  of killing Lakin Reilly, a Georgia nursing student.
*  An undocumented person.
*  And I shouldn't have used illegal.
*  It's undocumented.
*  So you regret using that word.
*  Yes.
*  During a campaign rally in Georgia, former President Donald Trump attacked Biden over
*  the issue.
*  I say he was an illegal alien.
*  He was an illegal immigrant.
*  He was an illegal migrant.
*  And he shouldn't have been in our country and he never would have been under the Trump
*  policy.
*  During the same speech, Trump mocked President Biden's stutter.
*  Wasn't it—didn't it bring us together?
*  Remember, he said, I want to bring the country together.
*  I'm going to bring it together.
*  No, no.
*  The president's speech at the Trump rally in Georgia came a day after he hosted Hungary's
*  authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at Mar-a-Lago.
*  Trump openly praised Orbán's autocratic style of rule.
*  There's nobody that's better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orbán.
*  He's fantastic.
*  As you know, the Prime Minister of Hungary, he does a great job.
*  He's a non-controversial figure because he said this is the best way to deal with the
*  situation.
*  That was Donald Trump speaking at Mar-a-Lago.
*  A U.N. fact-finding mission has found Iran is responsible for the physical violence that
*  killed Massa Amini in September 2022, sparking historic nationwide protests for months.
*  Massa Amini was a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was arrested by Iran's so-called morality
*  police allegedly for not wearing a hijab properly.
*  Hundreds of people were arrested in demonstrations that erupted after her death.
*  In a recent report, U.N. officials also accused Iran of committing crimes against humanity
*  while employing, quote, unnecessary and disproportionate use of lethal force, unquote, to crack down
*  on the protests.
*  Hundreds were killed by Iranian police forces while at least nine demonstrators have been
*  executed.
*  Millions of people across the globe took to the streets Friday, marking International
*  Women's Day.
*  Marches took place in Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Spain, Ukraine, Brazil and dozens
*  of cities around the world.
*  In a historic move, France enshrined abortion rights in its constitution as crowds gathered
*  in Paris Friday.
*  Meanwhile, over 180,000 people rallied in Mexico City, denouncing rampant gender violence
*  and femicides as nearly 10 women were killed every day in Mexico last year.
*  I worry about my friends.
*  I am worried something might happen to my daughter when she goes out to the street.
*  I am worried for all the women who never returned home and the families who are looking for
*  them.
*  And hundreds of protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza blocked traffic on Sunset Boulevard
*  on Hollywood Sunday, forcing a short delay to the start of the Oscars.
*  Several actors and musicians wore red artists for ceasefire pins, including Oscar-winning
*  Billie Eilish, Rami Youssef and Mark Ruffalo, who arrived late to the ceremony due to the
*  protests.
*  They're starting.
*  We're late.
*  We're late.
*  The Palestinian protests shut down the Oscars tonight.
*  Humanity wins.
*  During the Oscar ceremony, filmmaker Jonathan Glaser condemned the Israeli occupation after
*  his Holocaust film, The Zone of Interest, won an Oscar for best international film.
*  Our film shows where dehumanization leads at its worst.
*  It shaped all of our past and present.
*  Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked
*  by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people, whether the victims
*  of October—
*  Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all
*  are victims of this dehumanization.
*  How do we resist?
*  The Oscar for best documentary went to 20 Days in Maruupol about Russia's siege on
*  the Ukrainian city.
*  The film was directed by Mr. Slav Chernov, a Ukrainian video journalist with the Associated
*  Press.
*  This is the first—this is the first Oscar in the Ukrainian history.
*  And I'm honored.
*  I'm honored.
*  But probably I will be the first director on this stage who will say, I wish I would
*  never make this film.
*  I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our
*  cities.
*  Go to Democracy Now! to see our coverage of 20 Days in Maruupol and The Zone of Interest.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Thank you.
