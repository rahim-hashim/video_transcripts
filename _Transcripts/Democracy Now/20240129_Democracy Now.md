# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 29, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcAXn_XNKdE)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The Pentagon has accused Iranian-backed militants of killing three U.S. soldiers and injuring
*  34 others in a drone strike at a base in Jordan near the Syrian and Iraq border.
*  On Sunday, President Biden vowed the U.S. would respond, quote, at a time and in a manner
*  of our choosing, unquote.
*  The attack comes less than a month after a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad killed the head
*  of an Iranian-backed militia.
*  A group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed responsibility for attacking the
*  U.S. forces in Jordan.
*  Iran's denied any involvement.
*  In a statement, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said, quote, if the U.S. keeps supporting
*  Israel there will be escalations.
*  All U.S. interests in the region are legitimate targets and we don't care about U.S. threats
*  to respond, unquote.
*  The drone strike was the first fatal attack on U.S. forces in the Middle East since Hamas
*  attacked Israel on October 7th.
*  Two U.S. Navy SEALs died January 11th after going overboard while raiding a ship suspected
*  of carrying Iranian arms off the coast of Somalia.
*  In Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed at least 373 Palestinians since Friday, when the International
*  Court of Justice ordered Israel to take all possible measures to prevent genocide in Gaza.
*  In another major development, the United States and at least 12 other nations have suspended
*  funding to UNRWA, that's the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, after Israel accused
*  12 employees of the agency of taking part in the Hamas attack on October 7th.
*  UNRWA is one of the largest employers in Gaza, with a staff of over 13,000.
*  It provides essential aid to most of Gaza's 2.3 million residents.
*  The agency responded to Israel's allegations by firing nine employees.
*  The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, condemned the freezing of funds at a time when famine
*  is looming in Gaza.
*  He said, quote, Palestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment.
*  This stains all of us, he said.
*  Palestinian Prime Minister Mohamed Sdeah urged countries to reverse their decision
*  to freeze UNRWA funds.
*  Norway is continuing to fund UNRWA.
*  We'll speak with the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Eglund, later in the
*  broadcast.
*  In other news on Gaza, CIA Director William Burns is taking part in talks in Paris with
*  officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar over a proposed deal involving the release of Israeli
*  hostages in Gaza in exchange for a two-month pause to Israel's assault.
*  Thousands of Israelis gathered in Jerusalem on Sunday for a major conference calling for
*  Palestinians to be removed from Gaza in order to rebuild Jewish settlements.
*  Speakers at the conference included Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gavir
*  and Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Shmoutrick.
*  We are settling our land from width to length, controlling it and fighting terror always
*  and bringing with God's help security to all of Israel.
*  You know what the answer is.
*  Without settlement, there is no security.
*  A group of Palestinian Americans asked a federal judge Friday to bar the United States from
*  providing military, financial and diplomatic support to Israel for committing genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  The Biden administration has asked the judge to dismiss the case, which was brought by
*  the Center for Constitutional Rights.
*  One of the lawyers in the case, Mark Von Der Hood, spoke outside the federal courthouse
*  in Oakland, California, Friday.
*  We are very hopeful.
*  We think the evidence was overwhelming.
*  The government, the administration did not even contest, really, that there was genocide
*  going on.
*  They just say, Judge, whatever is going on, whether it's 20,000 or 30,000 or 50,000
*  or 200,000 or 2.2 million people who are ultimately killed, you can't do anything, Judge.
*  Nobody can do anything.
*  The president can do whatever the hell he wants.
*  And what do we say to that?
*  We say, hell no.
*  In related news, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged the FBI to investigate pro-Palestinian
*  protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Without sharing any evidence, Pelosi claimed on CNN the protesters may have ties to Russian
*  President Vladimir Putin.
*  Pelosi said, quote, for them to call for a ceasefire is Putin's message.
*  A federal jury ordered Donald Trump to pay E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in damages for
*  defaming her in 2019 while he was president of the United States.
*  This comes on top of the $5 million in damages he was ordered to pay Carroll last year by
*  another jury when he was found liable for sexually abusing her in the 1990s and defaming
*  her.
*  In a statement, E. Jean Carroll said, quote, this is a great victory for every woman who
*  stands up when she's been knocked down and a huge defeat for every bully who's tried
*  to keep a woman down, unquote.
*  Trump said he will appeal Friday's ruling.
*  Meanwhile, in a separate case, a judge is expected to rule this week on a $370 million
*  civil fraud suit brought against Trump by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
*  The Biden administration approved a $23 billion deal to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
*  The State Department notified Congress of its decision Friday, just days after Turkish
*  lawmakers voted to allow Sweden to join NATO.
*  A Kenyan court blocked a plan to send 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti to help combat
*  gang violence, ruling the move was unconstitutional.
*  The U.N. Security Council approved the mission last year.
*  Kenyan forces were due to deploy as early as this month.
*  In Haiti, the reaction to the news was mixed, as some residents have called for foreign
*  intervention amidst the spiraling violence.
*  Others have rejected any outside actors coming to Haiti.
*  The crisis is a Haitian crisis.
*  I remember in 2005 through 2006, when the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
*  arrived in Haiti.
*  They left behind children, diseases like cholera, and they left many children without dads.
*  Today, if we are united, we can do wonders.
*  Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso announced they are withdrawing from ECOWAS.
*  That's the Economic Community of West African States.
*  All three countries are led by military governments following coups in recent years.
*  The nations released a joint statement accusing the 15-country bloc of being, quote,
*  "...under the influence of foreign powers betraying its founding principles and becoming
*  a threat to its member states and its population."
*  Unquote.
*  Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have expelled the military of their former colonizer France
*  and were already suspended by ECOWAS in the wake of the military takeovers.
*  In a major victory for the climate movement, the Biden administration Friday paused approvals
*  for new liquified natural gas, or LNG, export terminals.
*  The move comes after years of organizing by activists in frontline Gulf communities
*  who've decried the projects as carbon megabombs.
*  This is Rochetta Sibley-Ozan of the environmental justice organization The Vessel Project.
*  Being a mom of six children living in this community, where my children have asthma and
*  other skin conditions, that they are battling every day, I know that these facilities are
*  not in the public interest.
*  Even in a community that smells like rotten eggs and chemicals, I know that these facilities
*  are not in the public interest.
*  But this pause is not just a minor achievement.
*  It is a significant milestone.
*  It sets the stage for potential rejections and slows down the progress of these projects.
*  And in related news, a Louisiana court okayed environmental permits for a new Formosa plastics
*  facility in St. James Parish.
*  It would be the country's largest plastics plant.
*  The area located along the Mississippi River is already known as Cancer Alley due to the
*  many toxic chemical plants that have sickened the majority black population.
*  Residents and activists have vowed to keep fighting the proposed Formosa plant.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
