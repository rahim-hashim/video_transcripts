# Top U.S. & World Headlines — February 20, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f-OcbLo7Y8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United States is proposing a U.N. Security Council draft resolution calling for a, quote,
*  temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable, unquote.
*  The draft measure also calls for the release of all hostages and an end to restrictions
*  on the delivery of humanitarian aid.
*  It's the first time the U.S. has used the word ceasefire at the Security Council after
*  vetoing previous efforts by other member states to stop the bloodshed.
*  This comes as the U.N. Security Council is voting today on a resolution by Algeria calling
*  for an immediate ceasefire.
*  The U.S. has already vowed to veto it.
*  It's not clear when the U.S. proposal will be put to a vote.
*  The death toll in Gaza since October 7th is nearing 30,000, not counting thousands more
*  who are missing, presumed dead and buried beneath the rubble.
*  Amidst worsening hunger, UNICEF is warning the war-torn territory is, quote, poised to
*  witness an explosion in preventable child deaths, which would compound the already unbearable
*  level of child deaths, unquote.
*  Israeli forces again opened fire at crowds waiting for humanitarian aid, killing at
*  least one person and wounding many others.
*  This is a displaced Palestinian seeking food aid in Gaza City.
*  Because we want to eat, we are dying of hunger.
*  Why would someone put themselves at risk of dying by coming here?
*  It is in order to feed the children.
*  We are dying of hunger, and there is no food or drink left in Gaza.
*  There is a famine.
*  The U.N. Human Rights Agency says it's received reports of rights violations against Palestinian
*  women and girls in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank since October 7th.
*  Israeli forces are accused of arbitrary executions, sexual assaults, separating families and many
*  other forms of inhumane treatment.
*  Degrading photos of Palestinian women were also reportedly taken by Israeli soldiers
*  and shared online.
*  U.N. experts are calling for an independent investigation into the abuses.
*  In The Hague, arguments are continuing at the International Court of Justice, where
*  Palestinians and more than 50 countries and organizations are testifying against Israel's
*  occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
*  It's the largest ever participation in the world court's history.
*  Earlier today, the South African ambassador, Wussi Madunsela, said the situation in Palestine
*  is a quote, more extreme form of the apartheid that was institutionalized against black
*  people in my country, he said.
*  Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said that quote, the genocide underway in
*  Gaza is a result of decades of impunity and inaction.
*  Riyad Mansour, Palestinian envoy to the U.N., delivered an emotional testimony Monday.
*  We are treated as children.
*  Not as demographic threat in which the identity of the group to which we belong does not diminish
*  the human rights to which we are all entitled, a future in which no Palestinian and no Israelis
*  is killed.
*  We'll have more on the historic world court hearings later in the program when we go to
*  The Hague.
*  Israel's Knesset narrowly voted Monday against expelling lawmaker Ofer Kassif, a member of
*  the Hadash Party who supported South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  The move to expel him fell short by just five votes.
*  To see our interviews with Knesset member Ofer Kassif, go to democracynow.org.
*  Meanwhile, Brazil has recalled its ambassador to Israel.
*  Brazil said it won't retract President Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva's comment calling
*  Israel's war on Gaza a genocide and comparing the attacks to the Nazi Holocaust remarks
*  that led Israel to declare Lula persona non brata in Israel.
*  Brazil's foreign ministry has also summoned the Israeli ambassador for talks.
*  In London, a critical appeal for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is underway at the
*  British High Court of Justice in what could be Assange's last chance to stop his extradition
*  to the United States.
*  Assange has been held in London's Belmarsh Prison since 2019.
*  He was charged under the U.S. Espionage Act and faces a 175-year prison sentence for publishing
*  classified documents exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  Julian Assange's wife, Stella, has called the situation a matter of life and death.
*  Before heading into court, Stella Assange addressed her husband's supporters gathered
*  outside for the two-day hearing.
*  There is no possibility of a fair trial if Julian is extradited to the United States.
*  He should never be extradited to the United States.
*  He would never be safe.
*  The United States plotted to murder my husband.
*  He is being accused of journalism.
*  This case is an admission by the United States that they now criminalize investigative journalism.
*  It's an attack on all journalists all over the world.
*  It's an attack on the truth and it's an attack on the public's right to know.
*  Julian is a political prisoner and his life is at risk.
*  What happened to Navalny can happen to Julian.
*  He has to be released.
*  This farce has to end.
*  In a controversial ruling in Haiti, a judge investigating the 2021 assassination of President
*  Jovenel Moïse has indicted the former First Lady Martine Moïse and ex-Haitian Prime
*  Minister Claude Joseph, accusing them of involvement in the killing.
*  Court documents accuse Martine Moïse, who was shot and seriously injured in the 2021
*  attack that killed her husband, of conspiring with Joseph to kill her husband and suggest
*  she was even plotting to assume the presidency herself.
*  The former chief of Haiti's national police is also among some 50 people recently charged.
*  Martine Moïse and Claude Joseph have denounced U.S.-backed acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry
*  for weaponizing Haiti's justice system to persecute his opponents.
*  Henry has himself been implicated in the assassination plot, including by a former judge who previously
*  oversaw the investigation.
*  Political turmoil and bloody gang violence has gripped Haiti amidst mounting protests
*  to remove Ariel Henry from power.
*  Indian farmers are continuing their protest march towards the capital, New Delhi, after
*  rejecting a proposal from the government for a five-year contract guaranteeing higher crop
*  prices.
*  Thousands of farmers have been camping out about 120 miles outside of New Delhi as authorities
*  have deployed tear gas and erected barricades to prevent access to the city.
*  On Monday, Mahinder Singh, a 100-year-old farmer from Punjab, joined the march.
*  My family stops me from protesting, but our expenses are not covered.
*  I have two children, daughters.
*  I have a family.
*  What choice do I have?
*  Our lands are gone.
*  Our rights are gone.
*  They, the government, do not give us the rights, even when we demand them.
*  In Wisconsin, Democratic Governor Tony Evers signed into law new congressional maps reversing
*  the extreme Republican gerrymandering enacted under Governor Scott Walker in 2011.
*  The move could give Democrats an edge in the swing state, as the whole Wisconsin assembly
*  and half the state Senate are up for reelection in November.
*  Wisconsin Republicans agreed to the new maps rather than challenge them at the state's
*  liberal Supreme Court, which they worried could result in new district lines more favorable
*  to Democrats.
*  This is Governor Evers at Monday's signing ceremony.
*  Wisconsin is not a red state.
*  It is not a blue state.
*  Wisconsin is a purple state, and I believe our maps should reflect that basic fact.
*  I believe, as I've also said, often said, that the people should get to choose their
*  elected officials, not the other way around.
*  In business news, Capital One announced it's acquiring Discover financial services for
*  $35 billion, merging two of the country's largest credit card companies.
*  The deal will have to pass regulatory approval, as the Biden administration is seeking to
*  tighten rules on financial mergers.
*  Meanwhile, Colorado is suing to block grocery chain Kroger's $25 billion merger with Albertsons.
*  The merger would create the largest supermarket chain in the United States, with some 5,000
*  stores giving it near-monopoly control to set prices and underpay its workers.
*  In Washington state, Japanese Americans are joining immigrant rights activists demanding
*  the closure of an immigration detention center in Tacoma run by the private group GeoGroup.
*  The Northwest Detention Center has been the site of several hunger strikes over the years
*  due to inhumane conditions.
*  State inspectors were recently denied entry to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
*  Jail.
*  On Friday, the groups blocked Seattle's federal building as part of their action.
*  I am here for my great-grandmother, Yoshie Iwamura, who had to give birth to my grandmother,
*  Karen Iwamura, in camp at Minidoka.
*  I say free them all and stop repeating history.
*  GeoGroup's Sudo for Solidarity and La Resistencia also marked the annual Day of Remembrance
*  when Japanese Americans were declared enemies of the state in 1942 and incarcerated.
*  And in Colorado, a former internment camp has reopened its doors as the nation's newest
*  national park.
*  Over 10,000 people of Japanese descent were imprisoned at Camp Amache between 1942 and
*  45.
*  National Park Service Director Chuck Sams, the first Native American to hold the position,
*  said, quote, Amache's addition to the national park system is a reminder that a complete
*  account of the nation's history must include our dark chapters of injustice.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!'s Juan González in Chicago.
*  Juan, it's an honor to celebrate the 28th anniversary of Democracy Now! with you, with
*  the whole team and our listeners, viewers, readers and stations.
*  To mark the occasion, we've just surpassed 2 million viewers on YouTube.
*  Yes, Amy, and who would have thought back in 1996 that this newscast, which was originally
*  supposed to be just a one-year program covering the 1996 presidential election for a handful
*  of Pacifica community radio stations, would still be on the air nearly three decades later
*  with a worldwide audience that has grown steadily since then.
*  I guess we must be doing something, right?
*  It's been an honor as well for me to work with you and the amazing staff of Democracy
*  Now! over all this time.
*  Well, it's been an epic journey, Juan, and I'm so glad to be on it with you.
