# Reporter Seymour Hersh on "How America Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline": Exclusive TV Interview
**Democracy Now!:** [February 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4BuMaGlKp0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!
*  co-host Juan Gonzalez in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  Well, we begin today's show with the legendary Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour
*  Hersh.
*  In 1970, he won the prize for his reporting for the Dispatch News Service on the My Lai
*  massacre, when the U.S. slaughtered more than 500 Vietnamese women, children and old men,
*  on March 16, 1968.
*  His reporting in The New York Times on CIA spying on antiwar activists during the Vietnam
*  War era helped lead to the formation of the Church Committee, which led to major reforms
*  of the intelligence community.
*  In 2004, in the pages of The New Yorker magazine, Sy Hirsch exposed the Abu Ghraib prisoner
*  abuse scandal in Iraq.
*  Well, last week, he published another bombshell report, but this time on his new substack
*  page.
*  The piece was headlined, How America Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline.
*  It looks at one of the great mysteries of the past year.
*  Who was behind the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipelines, which were built to carry natural
*  gas from Russia to Europe?
*  The pipelines were severely damaged last September in a series of underwater explosions in the
*  Baltic Sea.
*  In his new piece, Sy Hirsch cites an unnamed source, who says the sabotage was carried
*  out by the U.S. Navy, which planted remotely triggered explosives during NATO exercises
*  last September.
*  Hirsch reports the Biden administration began planning the act of sabotage in December
*  2021, two months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  On February 7th, 2022, President Biden held a joint news conference with German Chancellor
*  Olaf Scholz, and Biden brought up the future of the Nord Stream Pipeline.
*  If it invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
*  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream, too.
*  We will bring an end to it.
*  But how will you do that, exactly, since the project and control of the project is within
*  Germany's control?
*  We will, I promise you, we will be able to do that.
*  I'll promise you we'll be able to do that.
*  Well, Sy Hirsch reports U.S. Navy divers planted remotely triggered explosives on the pipelines
*  in June while NATO was conducting military exercises in the area.
*  He reports the divers were all members of the Navy and not members of America's Special
*  Operations Command, whose covert operations must be reported to Congress.
*  Then, on September 25th, 2022, a Norwegian surveillance plane dropped a sonar buoy, which
*  triggered the C-4 explosives that had been placed on the pipeline.
*  Soon after the explosion, the United States strongly suggested Russia was behind blowing
*  up its own pipeline.
*  This is National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan responding to a question at a White House
*  press briefing.
*  In his speech this morning, the president called the Nord Stream pipeline attacks, quote,
*  a deliberate act of sabotage.
*  And he said now the Russians are pumping out misinformation and lies about it.
*  Should we take that to mean that the U.S. now believes that Russia was likely responsible
*  for this act of sabotage?
*  Well, first, Russia has done what it frequently does when it is responsible for something,
*  which is make accusations that it was really someone else who did it.
*  We've seen this repeatedly over time.
*  But the president was also clear today that there is more work to do on the investigation
*  before the United States government is prepared to make an attribution in this case.
*  In the following months, there have been few public disclosures about the pipeline explosion.
*  In December, The New York Times reported Russia had begun expensive repairs on the pipelines,
*  a move which has raised questions about Western claims that Russia had bombed its own pipelines.
*  Meanwhile, some Biden officials have publicly praised the fact that the pipeline was blown
*  up.
*  Here is Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland speaking during a
*  recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
*  I am—and I think the administration is very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now,
*  as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.
*  We're joined now by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh to talk more about
*  his new piece, How America Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline.
*  While the White House has described Hersh's reporting as, quote,
*  "'complete fiction,' calls are growing for an independent probe into the explosion."
*  Sy Hersh, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  If you can flesh out what it is you found in your report and what first tipped you off,
*  albeit there were a lot of public comments, including the Polish government right after
*  the bombing, saying, thank you, America.
*  Lay it out for us, Sy.
*  Well, first of all, I think the reporting really can be described as a friend of mine
*  did.
*  What I did was really deconstruct the obvious.
*  I mean, you have to hear what the president said.
*  But, of course, there were secret plans that I'm writing about, and they include—there
*  was a committee set up.
*  Jake Sullivan was directly involved.
*  He was the national security adviser, still is.
*  They set up a team to look at options about how to put pressure on the Russian government
*  to back off.
*  I'm getting a bounce in my ear, so this is comical.
*  Can you hear me?
*  We hear you perfectly.
*  We don't hear the bounce, Sy.
*  Oh, OK.
*  That's great.
*  I hear it, though.
*  Anyway, and so, there was a—I'm just writing about inside baseball stuff.
*  It's the normal things you do.
*  They set up a committee to think of options.
*  Russia was clearly going to go.
*  The threat the president had yet to make had not been made, and this is December before
*  New Year's Day of the year before, 2021.
*  And the question inside the committee, and it included the usual CIA, NSA, Treasury Department,
*  State Department, you name it, and they met in the secret office building across the street
*  from the White House to the executive office building.
*  The option was, do you want us to do something kinetic or something not kinetic?
*  In other words, not kinetic would be more sanctions, or something kinetic would be taking
*  out the pipeline, as had been thought about.
*  And the answer came pretty quickly.
*  I would guess Victoria Nuland's statement that you mentioned came actually before the
*  president.
*  It came in late January of last year.
*  That statement came—at that time, I think, the committee involved, a lot of sophisticated
*  people in the intelligence and operations community, concluded you could do it, and
*  the White House was told it was possible.
*  I think that led to the comments, which really, of course, made the people on the inside go
*  half crazy because it was supposed to be completely covert.
*  But at that place, as I wrote, it was simply described as a classified operation.
*  None of the rules are reported in the Congress involved or were involved.
*  So they began their planning.
*  They went to Norway, which is a great ally of ours.
*  Norway was one of the original signers of the 1949 NATO treaty.
*  I think 19 nations were involved in that.
*  And Norway is a great ally.
*  We have spent—I write about this in some detail in the article—hundreds of millions,
*  probably more than close to being a more upgraded facility.
*  Norway has a 1,400-mile border along the Atlantic coast that goes from Oslo in Europe
*  all the way up north into—it runs into the Russian border above the Arctic Circle.
*  So we put a lot of facilities up north there, synthetic aperture radar, which costs a fortune
*  to monitor the Russian nuclear sites around and also their military activities around
*  there up in the other side of the peninsula, the Kola Peninsula.
*  So it's just—they're just our guys.
*  And they're also great at doing underwater stuff.
*  And so that's what happened.
*  We did a plan with them.
*  We had to clear it with Sweden and Denmark.
*  I'll leave it to them to decide whether that they were accepted the explanation.
*  We were doing exercises in the Baltic Sea for the hell of it.
*  But so far, I haven't seen much from either of them.
*  And it's a tiresome game to me.
*  So what happens is, when I do my story on SUPSEC, I wouldn't even think—I'm embarrassed
*  to say it, after all those wonderful years I had at The New York Times, I wouldn't even
*  think he'd take his story like this to The New York Times.
*  They've decided that the Ukraine War is going to be won by Ukraine, and that's what its
*  readers get, and that so be it.
*  That's their call.
*  So I just did my reporting.
*  And the miners came from a very small facility in a little small town in Florida.
*  And the mining community in the Navy is very secret, and they just do their business.
*  They don't talk.
*  They were perfect people to get.
*  And they practiced it.
*  And as you said, there was a major exercise every summer by the Sixth Fleet, which was
*  an American Sixth Fleet out of Italy, which controls—also has the operational rights
*  in the Baltic Sea.
*  The Baltic Sea is a huge place.
*  The pipelines we're talking about, Nord Stream 1, which came alive in 2011, and Nord Stream
*  2 was actually done.
*  But the Germans that are ready to pump, pump, has 750 miles.
*  And they go straight from Russia, which is loaded with all kinds of gas.
*  In Siberia, they have enormous reserves directly into Germany.
*  And I can tell you, Nord Stream 1 was a godsend for the German economy, and Western Europe.
*  They produced so much gas at such low prices that the German government was actually able
*  to resell some of the gas the Russians were providing at a profit without Russia objecting.
*  And so the German economy is huge.
*  It's booming.
*  The cars we know about, Germany has the largest chemical company in the world, BASF.
*  And everybody's—right now, it's held up.
*  It's gotten very cold there.
*  There's a lot of anger.
*  And anyway, the purpose—
*  So, Hirsh, so I wanted to ask you, in terms of the lack of—it always seemed to me when
*  the claims were that potentially Russia had sabotaged its own pipeline, that it was ludicrous
*  to think that that would be so, that they would invest so much money in pipelines and
*  then bomb them themselves.
*  But I'm interested in the lack of press attention since the sabotage occurred, and
*  also the lack of congressional attention.
*  I think back to the CIA's mining of the Managua harbors back in the early 1980s under the
*  Reagan administration, when the conservative Republican head of the Senate Intelligence
*  Committee, Barry Goldwater, objected and raised concerns that this was a covert operation
*  where Congress was not notified.
*  And then, of course, Congress cut off aid to the countries.
*  As a result, there was an international court of justice ruling against the United States.
*  But in this case, this kind of sabotage, the media seems not to be at all interested in
*  finding out what happened here, as you have, or—and Congress, there's no one in Congress
*  that's been raising questions.
*  You listen to the newscast that we just heard as the show opened, one horrible comment after
*  another.
*  I think the world's taking a very bizarre turn.
*  I also—you know, it doesn't matter what I think.
*  There's no question there's been a polarization of the press since Trump got in.
*  We're now on two sides, right, left, Democrat, Republican, however you describe it.
*  If you watch Fox News, you don't watch MSNBC, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And if you read the New York Times, you're not going to get what the right-wingers—the
*  conservatives have been after the New York Times and Washington Post, and they're a
*  quote-unquote liberal view.
*  So we've got a polarization going.
*  And at this time, we've got a president, a Democratic president, that has done some good
*  stuff domestically, but I can tell you, I'm not understanding the total commitment to
*  Ukraine, and I'm not understanding what I'm reading because obviously I have access to
*  a lot of people who see things.
*  I've been doing this, Amy, and I've been doing this, what, writing about COVID activities
*  for am I that old?
*  Three hundred years.
*  Anyway, the bottom line is the stories I've been getting about the war, particularly beginning
*  in fall, and that's what gets interesting, have been pretty dire.
*  The Russians, I don't think—I think the end is just a question of time.
*  Right now, it's a question of how many more people Zelensky wants to kill of his own people.
*  It's going to be over.
*  What happened is the plan was to put the bomb—and I can't answer your philosophical question
*  about why Congress isn't doing anything anymore.
*  Congress has pretty much polarized just as much.
*  And that's also an enormous continuing of hatred of all things Putin in this country,
*  which is foreign policy disagreements are one thing, but it's very personal here, and
*  that's not useful.
*  But anyway, the other—you know, he is—I don't think there's any chance that Putin
*  wants to take over Europe.
*  I don't think he wants to take—he wants to have Ukraine tamed, but he's not interested
*  in doing anything more.
*  But I may be in a minority about that.
*  What happens is there was an exercise in June, and it was supposed to—the bombs were put
*  in there under the cover of a NATO exercise.
*  There were a lot of different countries running around with divers and bowling up things.
*  It was an exercise to go find and chase mines.
*  There never had been one before.
*  It actually was.
*  Whoever in the CIA or in the other agencies that thought this up should get a bow because
*  it was pretty ingenious.
*  So in that exercise, the divers went down, did what they were trained to do.
*  They're very good, C-4, a couple hundred—whatever the weight is—bombs enough to blow up most
*  buildings in Washington and some in New York anyway.
*  They did their job, but the president at the last minute hesitated because he was afraid
*  blowing it up right after the exercise would put the finger at us.
*  And then he wanted permission to do it any time, and that caused an enormous trouble
*  in the team.
*  The team was—people are sophisticated in the intelligence services.
*  I know we have clichés about them.
*  We see the movies about them.
*  And the bottom line is, this made sense to them, blowing up a pipeline.
*  Blowing up a pipeline.
*  It's actually owned by a division of—Gaspron owns 51 percent.
*  That's all the Russian oligarchs.
*  49 percent of the Nord Stream 1 are owned by four business groups in Western Europe
*  who farm out the oil anyway.
*  They saw the threat as being valid.
*  And if he wanted to do it during an exercise, well, okay.
*  But in September, late September, they got the word—they fixed it so he could.
*  But then they thought it was—I don't know what they thought, but I don't think they
*  thought in late September he would blow up the main pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which is
*  a new one that had been just built.
*  And it had been sanctioned.
*  It had gas in it.
*  That's why so much leaks.
*  750 miles of methane gas is sitting in it.
*  But it had been sanctioned by the German government.
*  And so when he did that, here's what Biden did.
*  And this is what I think the ultimate point of the story, why so many people, even the
*  intelligence community, are very troubled by it.
*  What he did is he said, I'm in a big war with Ukraine.
*  It's not looking good.
*  I want to be sure I get German and West European support.
*  And I know winter's coming.
*  And if it's going to be bad, I don't want the Germans to say, we've got to check out
*  because we're getting massacred.
*  We'll be massacred with no cheap fuel.
*  And the economy will go bonkers.
*  We're going to check out and we're going to open up the gas line, which they could do.
*  So he took away that option.
*  What that has done, as America has been talking about ever since the first pipeline,
*  North Street One came online in 2011, and there were years before it was being built.
*  This goes back to the Bush-Cheney years.
*  And as you know, I did a lot of reporting for the New Yorker on those people, that particular gaggle.
*  Anyway, and at that time, they began to talk about the threat, the threat of gas, the threat
*  of cheap energy for Europe, what we've seen as a threat to make Europe be more palatable
*  or more willing to trade with Russia.
*  We always wanted to isolate Russia.
*  This has been a theme of the last decades.
*  Well, Simon, can I ask you also, there are several people—obviously, you've gotten
*  criticism at times for many of your exposés, but there are some people who are saying that
*  this particular exposé does not have a whole lot of documentation that essentially relies
*  on one source, one internal source, anonymous source of yours.
*  How do you respond to those criticisms that this is much less documented than previous
*  exposés of yours?
*  I'll get to that.
*  Let me finish my thought, because it's a very important thought.
*  The fear was Europe would pass away, walk away from the war.
*  Now what he's done—and you have to lift it up a little bit.
*  There you go.
*  There.
*  Now what he's done is he's told Europe, your second rate—and I think the consequences
*  of this for the Europeans are going to be horrific.
*  This has cut into the notion that they could depend totally on America, even in a crisis.
*  I think it's going to undercut NATO, which I always found to be supremely useless.
*  But certainly, the European countries are going to be—I know people that are paying
*  five times as much now for electricity.
*  People are paying three or four times more for gas.
*  There's not enough of it.
*  It's very expensive.
*  It's colder now than it was in the fall.
*  They had a lifefall because of climate change, if you want to believe it or not.
*  Anyway, I think the consequences politically for us are enormous.
*  I think the reason that Biden and his people in the White House have denied the story and
*  continue to deny it and get accepted by some of the press, my old newspaper, The New York
*  Times—I don't know why they're not doing more reporting on this instead of relying
*  on a denial and walking away from the story—diddle for the Washington Post.
*  I think the consequences politically for us in the long run, looking at even potential
*  some countries walking out of NATO, if that's what he thinks, that our being cold is less
*  important than him keeping the war going that he's not going to win, it strikes me.
*  As for the source question, I've been doing this so long.
*  I'm not bothered by the fact that the government attacks me and that my old newspaper, The
*  New York Times, hasn't written a word about it.
*  I find it sort of—that's where we are.
*  That's why people like me are in Substack, self-publishing thing.
*  I don't have to worry about censorship or second thoughts, but I don't talk about sources.
*  I'm lucky.
*  I've had for 20 or 30 or 40 years people inside who not only are faithful to what they're
*  doing but also are not afraid to be critical of it.
*  That's the kind of source that reporters dream about.
*  I've had people like that forever, and I still do.
*  There's been a lot of criticism.
*  One of the things I will get to your point about criticism, one of the criticisms is
*  the open source people.
*  OSINT, it's a very big part of the world now.
*  There are people that monitor air traffic and boat traffic and all that.
*  There are some two or three different groups that have produced statements saying that
*  none of the things they see tracks with my story.
*  I would say about that, if you're in the intelligence committee and you were running COVID officer
*  years and you're in Norway, we're working very closely with the Norwegians on this,
*  who by the way have increased their production of oil to Europe by double the, I don't
*  know the exact numbers, but it's gone up at least double, maybe even more than two
*  and a half times as much now without the pipeline.
*  But certainly the first thing you look at is how to take care of open source people,
*  make them think what happened isn't happening.
*  I mean, that's so obvious to me, but not to them.
*  And so—
*  Sye, I wanted to go to what Ned Price said at the State Department.
*  Sam Husseini of the Institute for Public Accuracy questioned the State Department spokesperson
*  about your reporting last week.
*  I'm sure you're aware of the new report from Seymour Hersh, how America took out the
*  Nord Stream pipeline and the White House's denial of any involvement, given the longstanding
*  U.S. opposition to the pipeline.
*  Lincoln's calling its demise a tremendous opportunity, and Secretary—Senator Secretary
*  of State Nuland is saying that the U.S. officials were pleased with the destruction of the pipeline,
*  especially the Sweden secretive investigation.
*  Do you think the U.S. government's denial of involvement is credible?
*  I absolutely do, and I repeat it here.
*  Let me follow up on that, if I might.
*  On the matter of you or anybody else at the State Department, any communication with
*  German, Norwegian ambassadors or other allies or officials on this matter?
*  On the matter of Nord Stream 2?
*  On the matter of the latest allegations, which give a—I mean, it's not an anonymous source,
*  but it is—it is—it is—it would not be—it would not be typical for us to engage allies
*  and partners on something that is utter and complete nonsense and that should be rejected
*  out of hand by anyone who is looking at it through an objective lens.
*  Yes, go ahead.
*  One more aspect on this.
*  One of the allegations that Hirsh makes is that it was taken off the CIA in order to
*  prevent involvement oversight as a covert operation.
*  Did you read the piece?
*  I'm familiar with it.
*  One of his allegations is that it was taken off the CIA—
*  Rather than let this propaganda be aired in the briefing room—
*  It's an eagle question.
*  —but let me just say it is a fundamental misunderstanding of oversight in our U.S.
*  Congress.
*  Beyond getting his facts entirely wrong, as he has before in very high-profile ways,
*  it is a fundamental misunderstanding to suggest that our intelligence community is not subject
*  to oversight.
*  Anyone who writes that, anything who writes anything like that, should not be believed
*  on any fact that Hirsh puts forward.
*  That it was taken off of a CIA and put under military in order to prevent—
*  Our military is also subject to rigorous oversight.
*  That's my question.
*  That's my question.
*  Yes.
*  The answer is yes.
*  So, that's Ned Price being questioned by Sam Husseini in the State Department press
*  briefing room.
*  Sy Hirsh, I'm wondering if you can respond.
*  You wrote an interesting follow-up today on Substack called Crap on the Wall.
*  Now, it's not your words, actually.
*  You're actually quoting the White House when they—the most bizarre effort came from
*  Defense Department of Donald Rumsfeld, you write.
*  Two decades ago, Secretary Rumsfeld, Vice President Richard Cheney discarded the rule
*  of law and common decency in their efforts to stomp out Muslim terrorism.
*  I was writing for The New Yorker.
*  You're talking about the Abu Ghraib scandal.
*  The White House responded to an article I published about the CIA's secret operations—oh,
*  no, no—inside Iran.
*  By calling it another example of Hirsh throwing crap—that was the word used by an assistant
*  secretary of defense on a wall to see what sticks.
*  Under Barack Obama, you say a senior national security adviser responded, Seymour Hirsh
*  is a known fabricator.
*  Adding the magazine, The New Yorker could publish that response to any future Hirsh
*  story without further checking.
*  Your response to all of this?
*  Well, my long-gone mother, who came here as an immigrant and loved America more than anybody,
*  particularly about Ned Price's stuff, she would have said he should have washed out
*  his mouth with soap, which is what she actually did to me a few times.
*  So anyway, that's what—what can I say?
*  It's, you know, sometimes—I won't say truth, that's true—sometimes different
*  versions of a story cause problems.
*  The reason I went into that sort of soliloquy about what's going to happen possibly in
*  NATO and Europe about Biden's act of saying to Western Europe and Germany, we'd rather
*  keep our war going—and you can say cold—is I think it could cause some countries to say,
*  we may be out of here.
*  What do we need NATO for?
*  And American support, when in a crisis, they take away our ability to keep our people warm.
*  It also could lead—I think the Green Party has done very well in Germany, the chancellors
*  from the Green Party—I think it's going to lead to widespread conservative movement
*  politically.
*  The one thing we did after World War II that was fantastic was we built Europe into a modern
*  democratic plurality, a society, political society.
*  I think it could lead to not—it won't go as far as it did in Italy.
*  We could lead to some conservative victories and subsequent legislations, because Europe's
*  always had no natural resources.
*  They've always had to rely on others.
*  And the others included us and also Russian gas.
*  And if we want to stop that off, we do it at a political cost.
*  And I think the point I'm making is I'm still going to do more reporting on this, because
*  there's still things I need to write about later.
*  I think this has probably been, in the view of some of the people who did it, one of the
*  dumbest things the American government has done in years, and we've had four years of
*  Trump.
*  In the long run, I just don't understand why more newspapers, good newspapers, like
*  The Times—I still read The New York Times.
*  I don't believe everything they say about Ukraine, but it's still—they've got wonderful
*  reporters there.
*  My attitude towards editors is if we got rid of 90 percent of the editors in the world,
*  we'd be much better off.
*  But that's always been—since I was a kid reporter, I thought that.
*  So, you know, I don't care what they say.
*  I mean, if I did, I would I would weep because some of the stuff is so dumb.
*  It's just so dumb.
*  And the Biden administration putting Ned Price, he's paid the work.
*  I don't fault him.
*  He actually knows intelligence.
*  He had a career in intelligence.
*  And from all I know, he's a perfectly decent—I know people that know him personally, and he's
*  a fine guy. He just told them what to say.
*  And he said—
*  And, Cy, you got to—
*  Let me just say this.
*  You got to go back to the state of state Tony Blinken.
*  After the bombing in September, he made a speech in which he—it was a press conference
*  in which he made a gratuitous statement.
*  He said, one good thing is that no more will Russia be able to weaponize gas.
*  And the notion of Russia weaponizing gas with Western Europe to get fame and to diminish
*  our power or our authority or our economic ability, control over Western Europe, has been a theme
*  of this country for two decades.
*  It's not a new theme.
*  Oil scares the hell.
*  Russian oil and gas always scared the hell out of Washington.
*  Now your question is still—
*  Yeah, and, Cy, lastly, the Norwegian government has claimed that one of the ships that you
*  mentioned in your article that was involved in the planning of this or preparation of this was
*  not present at the time of these exercises.
*  What do you make of Norway's denial?
*  Let me tell you something about Nicaragua if you don't know.
*  One of the things that happened in Nicaragua, the CA guys operating there would thrill and get
*  excited.
*  There were speeches there.
*  Even in the worst of times, in the Sardinian movement, they would go in their little motorboats
*  off the beaches and shoot flechettes into the beaches and have a contest to see who—I
*  shouldn't say the latter.
*  They would just shoot flechettes and know they were casualties.
*  They would just do that and have a lot of fun talking about it and bragging about it.
*  That's the kind of stuff you get to do when you have a COVID operation.
*  And so the Norwegian government is—that's just completely—oh, I'm sorry.
*  I dropped something here.
*  The government, not only did that ship have a—was in the operation, it also had a compression
*  chamber that had been flown in by the CIA.
*  Now I'm getting the details I don't want to bother with.
*  The CIA flew in a compression chamber that was put on the ship because it's just a submarine
*  hunter.
*  And the divers had 260 feet.
*  That's the level.
*  The Norwegians found the lowest level, the shallowest part of the Bolfit Sea,
*  which is off an island called—that's between Sweden and Denmark.
*  And they practiced there.
*  They had to.
*  And for the divers, it was 260 feet deep where the landlines were.
*  And the pipelines are steel-covered, but they're also covered by concrete shields.
*  So it's a serious job to blow them up.
*  And at 260, without a compression chamber, they'd have to go up every 90 feet.
*  They're breathing—it's amazing to me—they're breathing oxygen, nitrogen, and helium.
*  That's pretty amazing to me.
*  And they'd have to go up.
*  Now they could just pop up to the surface.
*  So it was called the Alta.
*  The ship was there.
*  I mean, that's just such a stupid lie.
*  But the submarine hunter, they didn't have to stay there.
*  They could just go and the guys could jump off.
*  And there was no long recovery.
*  At a certain time, they would come up, and the time was fixed.
*  You don't drop explosives like that and then let them go off in five minutes.
*  You give a lot of time.
*  You have a timer on it so that the divers could get up to the top.
*  And they come up and they make a pickup.
*  It could happen much more quickly than you think because there is—it's not in the description
*  of the ship, but on that ship, there was a decompression chamber.
*  It had been flown in and planted there by the CIA.
*  This was actually a brilliant operation, if you want to know it from the point of view of a
*  classic operation, because they got away with it.
*  And at that point, the purpose was always, as—let me go back to this.
*  The purpose of doing it is to make the threat credible.
*  But then you have the president and the undersecretary of state within a
*  weeks or two of getting a word that it's credible, we can do it.
*  Start blabbing about it.
*  Of course, that was disillusioning to the people involved, but so what?
*  I can't talk about it.
*  You can say it's not true.
*  I invented it, but that's just—look, he did it.
*  He's going to have to do it.
*  I watched my mail.
*  I watched my HG mail.
*  And I'm seeing every day more and more, more than I want.
*  I'm seeing more messages from around the world, different countries chiming in.
*  I'm seeing that.
*  I'm seeing something that was—and by the way, on Substack, it was—I didn't know about Substack.
*  It's an amazing platform.
*  They had more than a million hits on the thing within a day.
*  The messages I got from people who said, thank God, we missed the kind of reporting
*  that you and others have done.
*  We don't see it anymore.
*  I'm not talking about your show anymore, I guarantee you, not that.
*  AMY GOODMAN Well, Seymour Hersh, we want to thank you so much for being with us.
*  The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist will link to your new piece on your Substack,
*  how America took out the Nord Stream pipeline.
