# "Cobalt Red": Smartphones & Electric Cars Rely on Toxic Mineral Mined in Congo by Children
**Democracy Now!:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I3K7fhLmcE)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Nermi Sheik.
*  We end today's show looking at how the world's increasing reliance on cobalt for mobile phones,
*  electric cars, has had a devastating impact on the Congo.
*  Cobalt is a key component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.
*  Nearly three-quarters of the world's supply is mined in the Congo under horrific conditions.
*  Siddharth Kara documents the human rights and environmental catastrophe in the Congo
*  in his new book, Cobalt Red, How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives.
*  In it, he writes, quote,
*  "...there are many episodes in the history of the Congo that are bloodier than what's
*  happening in the mining sector today, but none of these episodes ever involve so much
*  suffering for so much profit linked so indispensably to the lives of billions of people around
*  the world."
*  Siddharth Kara continues,
*  "...spend a short time watching the filth-cake children of the Katanga region scrounge at
*  the earth for cobalt, and you'd be unable to determine whether they were working for
*  the benefit of Leopold or a tech company."
*  That's Siddharth Kara writing in Cobalt Red, How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our
*  Lives.
*  His previous book, Sex Trafficking, Inside the Business of Modern Slavery, won the 2010
*  Frederick Douglass Book Prize, awarded for the best book written in English on slavery
*  or abolition.
*  Siddharth Kara, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  It's great to have you with us from London.
*  This book is absolutely devastating, but of course it's describing that reality on the
*  ground in Congo.
*  Tell us the story of how you came to focus on this and how cobalt links the devastation
*  of the Congo to the West.
*  Well, thank you so much for inviting me to speak with you about this crucial and very
*  urgent matter.
*  I have been doing research on various forms of slavery and child labor around the world
*  for many, many years, starting in the year 2000.
*  In around 2016, I heard from some colleagues in the field about very appalling conditions
*  in the mining of cobalt in the DR Congo.
*  And I had no idea what cobalt was.
*  I thought it was a color.
*  I didn't know that it was in rechargeable batteries.
*  So it took me a little time to organize my first trip, establish ground relationships.
*  Congo the first time in 2018.
*  And what I saw was just so horrific, so extreme and severe.
*  And the fact that it was at the bottom of supply chains that reach out like a Kraken
*  across the global economy and touch the lives of everyone, everyone listening to us right
*  now cannot function for 24 hours without cobalt.
*  And as you noted in your remarks, roughly three-fourths of the world's supply comes
*  from the Congo.
*  And it's mined in conditions.
*  You read the sentence that links to Leopold.
*  It's mined in conditions that are like the colonial times, where the people of Africa
*  are reduced to brute labor, their lives are not valued, their labor is not valued, their
*  humanity is not valued.
*  And that's the reality that exists at the bottom of cobalt supply chains.
*  The book is just magnificent.
*  And as Amy said, it's completely devastating.
*  So if you could explain to us, for people, myself included, when I read the book, the
*  difference between artisanal mining and the conditions that exist on artisanal mines,
*  areas where artisanal miners search for cobalt, and industrial mining, and then describe some
*  of the conditions.
*  Who are these miners?
*  How many children are involved?
*  And how big are these mines?
*  You've said some of them are as large as European cities, including London.
*  Yeah, so let's spend a moment and just understand what's happening on the ground in that part
*  of the Congo.
*  And this is the southeastern part from the towns between Lubumbashi and Kolawezi.
*  And when you get down to that part of the Congo, there are massive industrial mining
*  operations on the one hand.
*  Now, outside of the Congo, consumer-facing tech and EV companies will have you believe
*  that all of their cobalt supply in their batteries for their gadgets and cars comes only from
*  these industrial mines.
*  Industrial means what it sounds like.
*  Heavy machinery, excavators digging and gouging at the earth.
*  What's happened there is not sustainable at all in terms of industrial activity.
*  Millions of trees clearcut, massive destruction and contamination of the environment.
*  Now, alongside that, and the reality is inside of these industrial operations, there are
*  hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of children, who dig by
*  hand.
*  Now, the quaint term given to them is artisanal mining.
*  And that makes you think that they're walking around baking bread or doing work in pleasing
*  conditions.
*  But nothing could be further from the truth.
*  Artisanal mining means these tens of thousands of children, hundreds of thousands of people
*  scrounging at the ground with pickaxes, shovels, stretches of rebar or their bare hands to
*  pull cobalt out of the ground and feed it up the chain.
*  Many of these people are digging inside industrial mines.
*  And outside of the Congo, tech and EV companies will have you believe that that does not happen.
*  But the truth on the ground is very different.
*  They also dig all around the countryside because cobalt is everywhere.
*  There are more reserves of cobalt in that part of the Congo than the rest of the planet
*  combined.
*  So the local population has been displaced by enormous mining operations.
*  You made note that some of these are as big as cities.
*  Well, these mining concessions, concessions means the territory a foreign mining company
*  is allowed to exploit.
*  The biggest one in that part of the Congo is the size of London, where I'm sitting right
*  now.
*  Imagine a London sized swath of countryside that's been completely gouged, destroyed,
*  clear cut and contaminated in this scramble to get cobalt out of the ground and up the
*  chain.
*  And imagine the hundreds of thousands of people who used to live in that territory, forcibly
*  displaced now without home, without a way to live.
*  And all they can do is scramble back into that ground, try to dig some cobalt out of
*  the earth and feed it up the chain for a dollar or two a day.
*  I want to turn to a clip from a 2017 Sky News special report on child miners in the DRC
*  cobalt mines.
*  When I wake up every morning, I feel terrible knowing I have to come back here again.
*  Everything hurts.
*  When I'm working here, I'm suffering.
*  My mother, she's already dead, and I have to work all day, and my head hurts me.
*  And this is a clip from a documentary produced by Australian Broadcasting Corporation last
*  year and a film titled Blood Cobalt, the Congo's Dangerous and Deadly Green Energy Mines.
*  Artisanal miner Mama Natalie explains why she works in the mines accompanied by her
*  two children.
*  I come to the mine to hustle.
*  If I am lucky, I make some money, and I buy food for the kids.
*  But if I don't, they go to sleep hungry.
*  We collect dirt.
*  The kids help by packing it up and washing it.
*  They also sort through it, looking for minerals.
*  It's not a good life for children.
*  We just don't have any other options.
*  So, Siddharth Kara, as we hear these voices of the people who are actually digging for
*  the cobalt, what about the responsibility of the corporations, names we know so well,
*  whether we're talking about Apple or—well, you name the names and then talk about what
*  they—how they explain this level of exploitation.
*  Certainly not something you could see in the children of California doing.
*  Well, by and large, these consumer-facing tech and EV companies look the other way.
*  And these are the big names we're all familiar with—Apple, Tesla, Google, Microsoft, Samsung.
*  I mean, you can go down the list.
*  They all buy some, most or all of their cobalt from the Congo, because there's no other
*  cobalt to buy, quite frankly.
*  They're all aware, to some degree, I'm sure, of the conditions on the ground.
*  And by and large, they simply offer PR statements that their supply chains are audited, that
*  they're certified, that they protect and preserve the human rights of every participant
*  in their supply chain, that they have zero-tolerance policies on child labor, that mining is done
*  sustainably.
*  So, you as a consumer, you as a shareholder, don't worry about it.
*  But the truth, the truth that the Congolese people have to share, is completely different.
*  They are at the bottom of the supply chain with no alternative but to eke out this base-scrounging,
*  hazardous, miserable existence for a dollar or two a day, feeding cobalt up the chain
*  to these behemoth tech and EV companies.
*  As your clip mentioned, the mother said, there's no other alternative there.
*  These people have been displaced and pushed to a cliff's edge.
*  If they want to eat, they have to put their lives at risk to dig cobalt out of the ground.
*  And it's part of the scramble.
*  You see, there is so much demand, especially being driven by this transition to electric
*  vehicles.
*  There is so much demand for cobalt that mining companies can't get it out of the ground quickly
*  enough.
*  Well, if you have hundreds of thousands of grindingly poor people there digging it out
*  of the ground, it's a penny-wage way of boosting production to try and meet demand.
*  And your listeners and viewers should understand, cobalt is toxic.
*  It's toxic to touch.
*  It's toxic to breathe.
*  So I have seen thousands of women with babies strapped to their backs inhaling toxic cobalt
*  dust day in and day out, 10-year-old children caked in toxic filth, exposing themselves
*  to toxic cobalt.
*  And the ore that these children are digging that has cobalt in it often has traces of
*  radioactive uranium.
*  So the public health catastrophe, on top of the human rights violence, on top of the
*  environmental destruction, is unlike anything we've ever seen in the modern context.
*  And the fact that it is linked to companies worth trillions and that our lives depend
*  on this enormous violence has to be dealt with.
*  And, Sadat, you point out—I'll just read out a short quote of yours, because you mentioned
*  what these miners are paid.
*  So you write, the most fortunate tunnel diggers in Kasulo earn around $3,000 per year, the
*  most fortunate.
*  By way of comparison, the CEOs of the technology and car companies that buy the cobalt mined
*  from Kasulo earn $3,000 in an hour, and they do so without having to put their lives at
*  risk each day that they go to work.
*  So if you could explain—I mean, first of all, talk, as you said, $7 or $8 is the maximum
*  a day that people earn.
*  What do these children get, these four-, five-, six-, seven-year-old children and countless
*  teenagers?
*  Yes, well, you see the riches that are enjoyed at the top of the chain, they're stacked
*  to the sky on top of the narrow, beleaguered shoulders of the children of the Congo.
*  So start with a family unit.
*  Men and teenage boys with some strength, they might be digging tunnels in a neighborhood
*  like Kasulo that you just mentioned, which is in Koloasi, ground zero for cobalt mining.
*  They dig shafts down into the ground, up to 100 feet deep, to try to find slightly higher
*  grades of cobalt ore.
*  Think of it like purity, so that instead of earning a dollar or two or three, maybe they'll
*  earn four or five or six.
*  Well, they're crouched in darkness, they don't have room to sit up as they work for
*  18 hours at a time underground, and those tunnels often collapse, burying alive everyone
*  inside.
*  On the ground, you'll have younger children and maybe mothers digging in pits and trenches
*  that could be a few meters deep.
*  They will gather sacks of dirt and stone and fill them up and take them over to putrid
*  rinsing pools where young children, little boys and girls will use a sieve to try to
*  separate dirt and stone from cobalt-bearing ore.
*  They go through this process throughout an entire day to fill one sack for which the
*  family might get two or three or four dollars from the buyers, the Chinese buyers, who then
*  sell it to formal industrial mining companies.
*  So at the bottom end, children could be earning 50 cents to a dollar for rinsing and sieving
*  and sorting.
*  And at the best—on the best day, tunnel-digging males and teenage boys might earn five or
*  six or seven dollars, but putting their lives at risk for a potentially horrid demise each
*  and every day.
*  So, can you talk about the responsibility of the Congolese government, of China, of
*  the United States?
*  Well, ultimately, what needs to happen is the companies at the top of the chain have
*  to accept responsibility for the conditions at the bottom of their cobalt supply chains.
*  It's that lack of accountability, the lack of accepting responsibility for the conditions
*  of labor of the Congolese people and the environmental destruction that leads to a host of other
*  ills.
*  Every actor in the supply chain, from Chinese mining companies to the Congolese government,
*  they're all parts of a chain that starts at the top.
*  And there are bad actors at every level.
*  The Congolese government, of course, has its role to play in not adequately and equitably
*  allocating mining revenues to the population there.
*  There's corruption and graft, of course, which plagues the country of the Congo.
*  But China, it dominates and controls mining production on the ground.
*  And what I've seen with my own eyes, and what any Congolese person living in the Katanga
*  region will tell you, is they pay no heed to the human rights of the Congolese people,
*  and they pay no heed to the environment, to environmental protection.
*  Mining companies, especially the Chinese ones, dump toxic effluents in the earth, the air,
*  the water.
*  I have seen villages with children playing in the dirt covered in sulfuric acid powder
*  that is wafting over the entire countryside from mineral processing plants at Chinese
*  mining companies.
*  And as I've mentioned a few times, millions of trees have been clear-cut.
*  And I never met anyone in the Congo who said they saw anyone planting one tree to replace
*  them.
*  The waterways, lakes and rivers have also been polluted.
*  So fish stocks are polluted, animal stocks are polluted, vegetables are polluted.
*  Everyone there is being slowly poisoned to death by cobalt mining operations.
*  That's the truth that the stakeholders at the top of the chain don't want us to know,
*  but that's the truth the Congolese people are desperate to share.
*  Sadat, could you explain, you talked about how is it that China came to play such a huge
*  role in the cobalt mining industry, owning and financing as many of the mines, 15 out
*  of the 19 major industrial copper cobalt mining complexes in the main cobalt-producing provinces
*  that you visited.
*  How has China come to play this role?
*  And then talk about the depots, the bosses that you spoke to.
*  It was very difficult to get into the depots.
*  They all have armed guards and so on.
*  What did those, the Chinese bosses of these depots tell you about the conditions there,
*  what they're doing there?
*  And did they take any responsibility at all for the conditions under which these miners
*  were working?
*  Well, in a way, you have to give China credit.
*  15-plus years ago, they saw that the future was going to be rechargeable batteries, and
*  that meant cobalt.
*  And they shrewdly determined all the cobalts in the Congo, and starting in 2009 with the
*  previous administration of President Joseph Kabila, they started signing deals.
*  And the first one they signed in 2009 was a $6 billion loan and infrastructure deal
*  in exchange for access to several copper cobalt mines in the Congo.
*  And that opened the door, that opened the floodgates, and then it was one state-run
*  Chinese mining company after another signing deals with the Kabila administration.
*  And before the West knew what was happening, China had locked down the bottom of the cobalt
*  supply chain, and from that point forward, they vertically integrated it.
*  They controlled probably 70 to 80 percent of mining production on the ground in the
*  Congo.
*  Last year, they supplied about 80 percent of the world's supply of refined cobalt and
*  probably half of the world's supply of rechargeable batteries for phones, laptops, and cars.
*  But how does this artisanal cobalt, the child-mined cobalt, enter into that formal supply chain?
*  Well, there's an informal ecosystem that exists right next to the formal supply chain.
*  And imagine it like this.
*  You have hundreds of thousands of people digging all around that part of the countryside, filling
*  up sacks of cobalt.
*  And they take it to these depots, or they're also called buying houses, and most of them
*  are run by Chinese agents.
*  And their job is to buy up artisanal cobalt and sell it straight to industrial mining
*  companies.
*  And so you can just sit outside, and they advertise with these pink tarps.
*  They'll say, copper cobalt depot, $1 million depot, dollar-signed depot.
*  And so artisanal miners sell their cobalt to these buying houses, and at the end of
*  the day, you see huge cargo trucks from the industrial mines pull up and buy up all these
*  sacks, hundreds and hundreds of sacks of tons of cobalt being purchased, and they take them
*  right into the industrial mine, where it's then mixed with the industrial production.
*  And from that point forward—this is very important for people to understand—from
*  that point forward, there is no way to disaggregate which cobalt was pulled out of the ground
*  by an excavator and which cobalt was pulled out of the ground by hands of a child.
*  And any company that claims otherwise is either recklessly ignorant of the truth on the ground
*  or they're dealing in falsehood.
*  So, we're talking to Sudarth Kara, who is author of Cobalt Red.
*  You end your book quoting the last letter of Patrice Lumumba to his wife, Patrice Lumumba,
*  the Congolese independence leader, first prime minister, who was assassinated in 1961.
*  The U.S. went after him, this, specifically the CIA, Belgium.
*  Talk about this quote, when you write, Patrice Lumumba offered a fleeting chance at a different
*  But the neocolonial machinery of the West chopped him down and replaced him with someone
*  who would keep their riches flowing, and that was the longtime, decades-long dictator Mobutu
*  Sesecekho, long supported by the United States.
*  Well, let's go back to the moment of independence in 1960 in the DR Congo.
*  And 17 countries in Africa got independence from their colonial powers that year.
*  Congo was coming out of centuries of the slave trade and then Belgian colonialism.
*  Patrice Lumumba was a very bold, popular nationalist leader.
*  He was elected in the country's first democratic elections to be their first president and
*  prime minister.
*  And he had a bold vision that the Congo's mineral wealth, its rich resources, and the
*  Congo is blessed with enormous riches and resources.
*  His vision was that those resources should be for the benefit of the Congolese people
*  and not foreign powers.
*  Well, 11 days after independence, Belgium amputated the part of the Congo that we're
*  talking about right now, Katanga, where all the mineral resources are, and that was 80
*  percent of the country's economy at independence.
*  So 11 days, the country had 11 days of freedom before Belgium went in and amputated the most
*  important part of the country.
*  Well, Lumumba asked the United Nations for help expelling the Belgians.
*  They did not cooperate, so then he turned towards the Soviet Union and asked their help
*  in expelling the Belgians from his country.
*  Well, the thought that the Congo's mineral riches would flow towards the Soviet Union
*  and not continue flowing to the West sent those neo-colonial powers into a tailspin,
*  and they hatched a plan very quickly to dispatch of Lumumba.
*  The U.S., Belgium, the CIA, they were all involved in capturing Lumumba.
*  They flew him to the Belgian stronghold in Katanga, tortured him, shot him, chopped him
*  to pieces, dissolved his body in acid, ground his bones to dust so no trace could ever be
*  found except for one tooth that was held as a souvenir by one of the Belgian assassins.
*  And in fact, that tooth was just returned by Belgium to Lumumba's descendants last year.
*  So the lesson was, the lesson was, unless you play ball with the West, we'll chop you
*  down and replace you with someone who will.
*  And as you noted, that person ended up being Joseph Mobutu for three decades, a corrupt,
*  bloodthirsty, a desperate enkleptocrat who ran the Congo into the ground.
*  And so the Congo really never had a chance.
*  It's just been one set of corrupt leadership after another, but they had their chance
*  at freedom and maybe a completely different path with Lumumba after independence.
*  But sadly, the colonial powers had other plans.
*  So Dada, if we could go back to the stories, in fact, that you heard while you were in
*  the Congo, what's in fact become of the place.
*  You interview many miners and families of miners in the book.
*  Could you tell us a couple of those stories, the story, for example, of Elodie or Lubel?
*  Just tell us what they told you, who they are.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Elodie was a young girl I met on my first trip to the Congo.
*  She was 15 years old, an orphan.
*  She was digging in an area called Lake Malo, which is near a village called Kapata in the
*  Coloase area.
*  And she'd been orphaned by cobalt mining.
*  Her father, she reported, died in a tunnel collapse inside an industrial mine right next
*  to where she was digging when I met her.
*  And her mother died from some infection or illness.
*  She wasn't sure, but her mother was someone who rinsed cobalt stones in the very toxic
*  waters at Lake Malo.
*  And Elodie was an orphan on her own.
*  And there are thousands of children who have been orphaned by cobalt mining.
*  And they scramble and scrounge for cobalt.
*  And in her case, she couldn't make ends meet.
*  She had to prostitute herself as a teenager to try to get money to survive.
*  When I met her, it was pretty clear to me she was in the later stages of HIV.
*  She had a two-month-old son strapped to her back.
*  She was wiry, mucous-crusted, very, very ill.
*  And what I saw in her was the face of what the global economy was doing to the Congo.
*  It's almost impossible to imagine that the degradation of this child and children like
*  her can be transformed by the global economy into shiny phones and cars.
*  But that's exactly what's happened.
*  She was sort of the quintessence of this story, the complete degradation of Congolese children,
*  children thrown to a pack of wolves by a global economy that transformed their degradation,
*  their suffering into the indispensable gadgets and cars that we rely on every day.
*  And that's an injustice.
*  That's an utterly caustic, miserable formula that needs to be set right, because we can't
*  conduct our rechargeable economy and our daily lives by inflicting such violence and suffering
*  on some of the poorest children in the world.
*  Siddhartha Karo, we want to thank you so much for being with us, author of the new book
*  Cobalt Red, How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives, his previous book, Sex Trafficking
*  Inside the Business of Modern Slavery, won the 2010 Frederick Douglass Book Prize, awarded
*  for the best book written in English on slavery or abolition.
