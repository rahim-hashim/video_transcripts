# Rashid Khalidi, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Michelle Alexander & Yasmin El-Rifae on Palestine
**Democracy Now!:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV7-rK8_GF8)
*  This news is funded by viewers like you.
*  Please support our work at democracynow.org.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Today a special broadcast.
*  But we must speak on Palestine and the mandates of conscience.
*  That was the name of a November 1 event here in New York, where leading writers and academics
*  came together to speak out against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
*  The event was held at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, but it almost didn't
*  happen.
*  Four other venues refused to host the gathering.
*  Over the next hour, we'll hear the words of the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates,
*  who won the National Book Award for his book Between the World and Me.
*  He was in conversation with the Palestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said
*  professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University.
*  His books include The Hundred Years' War on Palestine.
*  Their discussion was moderated by Michelle Alexander, the renowned civil rights attorney
*  and author.
*  We begin with Yasmeen El-Rafaii, author, writer and producer of the Palestine Festival of
*  Literature.
*  Since 2008, PALFEST has been bringing writers and artists from around the world to participate
*  in Palestine for a week-long festival, staging free public events in multiple cities across
*  Palestine.
*  Some of you have been our guests, participants and advisors.
*  As we come together in this beautiful sanctuary tonight, churches, mosques, hospitals and
*  refugee camps in Gaza are being bombed by Israel.
*  Our PALFEST colleagues, friends and partners in the West Bank are living in terror for
*  their safety and the safety of their families.
*  The young writers in Gaza who organized a night of poetry in the besieged strip ahead
*  of the opening of PALFEST in Ramallah last May have stopped replying to their messages.
*  Mohammed Al-Qudwa, who contributed a poem to that evening last May, is still occasionally
*  replying to messages and posting on Instagram.
*  With no food, water or power in Gaza and amidst constant bombardment, he writes that when
*  his phone lights up, the internet feels like a miracle.
*  Some of the writers and activists in the West Bank whose homes PALFEST visited just last
*  May and in years prior are having their photographs and addresses circulated on chat groups among
*  armed Israeli settlers calling for their murder.
*  Some of the publishers and editors who have worked with these writers and artists and
*  activists are in this room today.
*  In response to this disaster, we are holding this event as an urgent intervention by writers,
*  scholars and poets who have worked at the unavoidable intersection of art and politics,
*  who have thought deeply about land, segregation, colonization, history and liberation.
*  We thank the Union Theological Seminary for taking us in at a time when events in this
*  city are being canceled and censored.
*  This is the fifth space we approached to host us this evening.
*  The difficulty is not because of availability.
*  That was Yasmine El-Rafaii of the Palestine Festival of Literature speaking at an event
*  at the Union Theological Seminary here in New York.
*  It was titled, But We Must Speak on Palestine and the Mandates of Conscience.
*  This is civil rights attorney Michelle Alexander, renowned author of the book The New Jim Crow,
*  Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.
*  About five years ago, Alexander wrote a widely read op-ed piece for the New York Times headlined
*  Time to Break the Silence on Palestine.
*  The fact that so many people are here tonight, so many, from all different religions, races,
*  genders, is itself a testament of hope.
*  I know that so many of us are carrying a great deal of grief, fear, anger, internal conflict
*  and despair into this room.
*  I hope that we can breathe together now that we have arrived, exhale, open our hearts to
*  one another and listen deeply to each other.
*  We are here.
*  We are many.
*  We are not alone.
*  On behalf of Serene Jones, the president of Union Theological Seminary, I want to welcome
*  you to James Chapel.
*  Serene could not join us tonight because she has a commitment in Washington, D.C., but
*  she wishes she could be here and she extends a very warm welcome to all of you.
*  It's no secret that many people are closing their doors to these kinds of vital conversations
*  right now, fearful of what others might say, think or do in response.
*  So I am enormously grateful that Serene said yes when I asked her if the Palestine Literary
*  Festival could come to Union and use this sacred space.
*  She said yes, knowing that her decision might invite criticism or rebuke, but she also knew
*  that James Chapel has been the site of many, many difficult, courageous conversations,
*  dialogues that are essential to our collective liberation and the creation of beloved community.
*  In fact, it was in this very space that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was originally
*  scheduled to deliver his 1967 speech condemning the Vietnam War.
*  The event was ultimately relocated to Riverside Church across the street due to the overwhelming
*  number of people who wanted to hear what he had to say and our space limitations here.
*  At Riverside, Dr. King stepped to the podium and said, quote, I come to this magnificent
*  house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice.
*  A time comes when silence is betrayal, and that time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.
*  Dr. King acknowledged how difficult it can be for people to speak out against their own
*  government, especially in times of war, and that the temptations of conformity may lead
*  us toward a paralyzed apathy.
*  He did not deny that the issues present in Vietnam were complex, with long histories,
*  and he recognized that there were ambiguities and that North Vietnam and the National Liberation
*  Front were not paragons of virtue.
*  But he said that he was morally obligated to speak for the suffering and helpless and
*  outcast children of Vietnam.
*  He said, quote, this I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves
*  bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which
*  go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions.
*  We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and
*  for those it calls enemy, for no document from human hands can make these humans any
*  less our brothers, end quote.
*  He condemned the Vietnam War in unsparing terms.
*  He decried the moral bankruptcy of a nation that does not hesitate to invest in bombs
*  and warfare around the world but can never seem to find the dollars to eradicate poverty
*  at home.
*  He called for a radical revolution of values.
*  He said, quote, we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented
*  society when machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered
*  more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism
*  are incapable of being conquered, end quote.
*  Dr. King was condemned by virtually every major media outlet in America for taking the
*  stand and even within the civil rights community, many imagined that he was a traitor to the
*  cause and yet we now know, deep within us, we know that he was right.
*  He is right.
*  He is right today as he was back then about the corrupting forces of capitalism, militarism
*  and racism and how they lead inexorably toward war.
*  And he was right that our conscience must leave us no other choice.
*  We must speak when the oppressed, the poor, the weak are under attack, when their homes
*  are stolen or demolished, when they are forced to migrate and to live in unspeakable conditions,
*  in open air prisons, concentration camps perpetually as refugees under occupation, we must speak.
*  We must speak when Jewish children are brutally killed in the name of liberation, when anti-Semitism
*  and Islamophobia slip in through the back door of supposedly progressive spaces, when
*  Palestinian children in refugee camps are bombed and killed, when schools and hospitals
*  and entire neighborhoods are laid waste, we must speak.
*  When international law is treated like a naive suggestion, we must speak.
*  Yes, it may be difficult.
*  Yes, we will make mistakes.
*  We are human.
*  And yes, we may be afraid.
*  But we must speak.
*  Countless lives and the liberation of all of us depend on us breaking our silences.
*  And what's required in these times, as I see it, is not only activism and politics,
*  but also deeply personal spiritual work.
*  As Grace Lee Boggs once said, quote, these are the times to grow our souls.
*  All of us have a conscience that whispers to us, sometimes in the dark.
*  The mandates of conscience that arise within each of us arise not out of loyalty to abstract
*  principles or doctrines, but from a place of deep knowing, a deep knowing that we owe
*  something to each other as human beings, that we belong to each other, and that our freedom
*  and liberation depends on one another.
*  If I do not stand and speak up when the bombs are raining down on you, then who will speak
*  up for me, for my loved ones when the tables are turned, as James Baldwin wrote to Angela
*  Davis more than 50 years ago when she sat in a prison cell?
*  For if they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us that night.
*  Civil rights attorney and author Michelle Alexander, speaking at a November 1 event
*  at the Union Theological Seminary here in New York, organized by the Palestine Festival
*  of Literature.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In this special broadcast, we're airing excerpts of a recent event organized by the
*  Palestine Festival of Literature at the Union Theological Seminary here in New York.
*  It featured a discussion between the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and Columbia University
*  professor Rashid Khalidi.
*  Coates won the National Book Award for his book Between the World and Me, his other books,
*  We Were Eight Years in Power, The Beautiful Struggle and the novel The Water Dancer.
*  Rashid Khalidi is the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University.
*  His books include The Hundred Years' War on Palestine.
*  Their conversation was moderated by the civil rights attorney and author Michelle Alexander,
*  who asked about personal connections to Palestine.
*  This is Professor Rashid Khalidi.
*  I'm honored to be here, and I'm extremely pleased that it was possible to put this together.
*  This is the second Palestine Festival of Literature event that has been canceled and canceled
*  again, and the heroic organizers managed to pull it together.
*  They did the same thing in London, where I was supposed to speak, last Friday.
*  And it was canceled and canceled again.
*  In London, they sent the anti-terrorism police to the Royal Geographic Society and told them
*  they could not hold the event, but they held it anyway.
*  My...
*  My...
*  My connection to Palestine is obviously a personal one.
*  My family is from there.
*  I have family there now.
*  My niece's family is actually in Gaza.
*  They live in Rimman, which is a neighborhood of Gaza right near the sea, or not far from
*  the sea.
*  They fled from their home under bombardment to the southern part of Gaza.
*  They were being bombarded there, and so they went back to the shelter of their home.
*  And then just two days...
*  Just yesterday, because they were warned that the neighborhood would be bombed, they moved
*  to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which is, like all hospitals in Gaza, threatened by
*  the Israeli military with being bombed.
*  So that's part of my connection.
*  And I have family in other places there.
*  I was there last in March, and it was obvious that the situation was on the point of exploding.
*  One has to be there to see exactly how awful occupation and dispossession and decades of
*  living as people have had to live.
*  Whether in refugee camps or in other parts of occupied Palestine, whether they're Palestinian
*  citizens living as fifth-class citizens in Israel, whether they're in the Gaza Strip,
*  whether they're in the West Bank, whether they're in Jerusalem.
*  I should say that my wish is that every single one of you has a chance to go there.
*  People who have been there have found it a transformative experience.
*  You actually cannot believe what settler colonialism is like.
*  You cannot believe that in the 21st century this is being done to an entire people unless
*  you see it.
*  You can read about it, you can understand it theoretically, but you have to see it.
*  And I urge those of you who have the opportunity to please try and go there.
*  Yeah, I want to pick up on where she left off.
*  I went with Powerfest.
*  Yasmin, Omar, and all the organizers of the Powerfest hosted me.
*  And I was there for five days in occupied territories in Jerusalem, and then I stayed
*  another five days after that.
*  And I had this degree of anxiety about going because I knew I was going to see something,
*  something I couldn't quite name.
*  And I knew because of my upbringing, because of my mother, because of my father, because
*  of my wife, because of my son, because of my community, that after I saw the thing I
*  would have to come back and talk about it.
*  That there was no option in which I did not talk about it.
*  And I thought I was going to another country.
*  But in fact, what amazed me was I actually felt that I was in the same country.
*  But I was in a different time.
*  I was in the time of my parents and my grandparents.
*  I can think back to all of the articles I've read, all the things I've seen said about
*  how complicated and how complex the situation is and the occupation is.
*  I say it's complex, it's complicated.
*  And it's made to sound as though you need a degree in Middle Eastern studies or some
*  such, a PhD, to really understand what's happening.
*  But I understood the first day.
*  We went to East Jerusalem to try to visit in the way that Muslims visit to Alaska Mosque.
*  And I can remember being there and there were four IDF guards, biggest guns I'd ever seen
*  in my life.
*  And they checked IDs and they gave us our IDs back.
*  And then they did nothing.
*  They just made us wait.
*  And we waited and we waited and we waited.
*  There was no list.
*  There was no protocol.
*  There was no anything.
*  They were just making us wait because they could.
*  And somewhere in the back of my mind I was like, I know what this is.
*  I know exactly what this is.
*  The second day we went to Hebron.
*  And I can remember walking down streets with a Palestinian guide.
*  And we would get to certain streets and he would say, I can't walk down this street with
*  you.
*  You can walk, I cannot because I'm Palestinian.
*  And I thought, I know what that is.
*  As we drove through the occupied territories and I would look out and I would see roads
*  that Palestinians could use and roads that only Israeli Jews could use, I said, I know
*  what this is.
*  As I saw different colored license plates for different classes of people, I said, I
*  know what this is.
*  As I saw communities that I can only describe as segregated, I said, this is Chicago.
*  It's Baltimore.
*  It's Philadelphia.
*  And I don't mean to center the whole world on America.
*  We have a tendency to do that.
*  But my lens is my lens.
*  This is all I have.
*  And what I felt was a tremendous weight.
*  I felt the obvious thing that I think all of us feel that our tax dollars are effectively
*  subsidizing apartheid, subsidizing a segregationist order, a Jim Crow regime.
*  But I also felt that as an African American who was reared on the fight against Jim Crow,
*  against apartheid.
*  I felt tremendous shame.
*  How could I not know?
*  How could I not know that the only democracy in the Middle East as it builds itself is
*  segregated?
*  How did I not know that?
*  And what I came to, Michelle, was that Israel is a democracy, the only democracy in the
*  Middle East in the exact same way that America is the oldest democracy in the world.
*  So the relationship was quite clear.
*  It was quite clear.
*  It was palpable.
*  It was felt.
*  And the responsibility was clear after that.
*  So let's take a step back and talk a little bit about the history.
*  Both of you have written a lot about the importance of understanding history in order to engage
*  meaningfully with our present.
*  Both of you have talked about history, ongoing processes rather than as complete, finished,
*  and in the past.
*  And you've written that there was no isolated event, the Nakba, that began and ended in
*  1948, but rather a hundred years war on Palestine.
*  And so I'm wondering if you could share with us what you think people need to know, need
*  to understand about the history of Palestine in order to act in meaningful and courageous
*  ways now.
*  And also what do they need to know about the history of Palestinian resistance since it
*  is so often portrayed in the media in such an ahistorical fashion as though Palestinian
*  resistance is driven by hate rather than by a natural, unquenchable yearning to be
*  free.
*  And so share with us what we need to know in your view.
*  Thanks Michelle.
*  What we need to know, all of us, is more about the history.
*  What we need to know is, I think, summed up in the title of the book that you just mentioned.
*  This is part of a hundred years war on Palestine.
*  It's not a war in Palestine.
*  It's a war to implant a settler colonial presence at the expense of an indigenous people, which
*  is being pushed out slowly but surely.
*  And when we say the Nakba, the disaster, we start by talking about what happened in 1948.
*  But that's part of a much longer process.
*  Can you explain what happened in 1948?
*  I will.
*  In 1948, 750,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes, starting months before the
*  state of Israel was created, including 70,000 people in Jaffa, 70,000 people in Haifa, the
*  two of the largest Arab states in Palestine, 30,000 people in Jerusalem, all of this before
*  Israel was even created.
*  And then once Israel was created, once the war between Israel and the Arab states started,
*  hundreds of thousands of more were driven out.
*  That was not a result of war.
*  That was part of a settler colonial process which dictates that you must eliminate, reduce,
*  push out the indigenous population in order to replace it with settlers.
*  That is what Israel is.
*  Israel is a national fact, but it is also a settler colonial fact.
*  It is a fact very similar to the facts that were created in Ireland by settlers sent over
*  to push the indigenous population to the west of Ireland.
*  Settlers brought to this country to push the indigenous population west and out of the
*  land that white colonists wanted to settle.
*  It's different, but it's exactly, it's different in its specifics, but it's exactly the same
*  process.
*  And the war is not one between equals.
*  It is a war between an indigenous population and an externally supported powerful movement
*  rooted always in western Europe and the United States.
*  This is the metropole for that project.
*  This is where that project gets its money, its guns, its vetoes in the Security Council.
*  Without that, we wouldn't be where we are.
*  Without the Balfour Declaration.
*  Without the British.
*  Without the British and the French.
*  Without the United States.
*  And I think it's really, really important to understand all of these facts.
*  That it is, this has been a process which is driven by a demographic imperative.
*  To create a Jewish majority in a country which until 1948 had an overwhelming Arab majority.
*  To create a Jewish state which was the objective of Zionism.
*  In an overwhelmingly Arab land, you had to reduce the Arab population.
*  And in order to do that, you had ultimately to use force.
*  That's what the Nakba starts with.
*  Force.
*  Hundreds of thousands more are pushed out after the 1967 war.
*  And in the interim, there's constant pressure on Palestinians to leave.
*  Permits are revoked.
*  Residencies are revoked.
*  You're not allowed to enter.
*  You're not allowed to retain this citizenship or to live here.
*  All of it designed to squeeze the population.
*  Either out of the country or into smaller and smaller spaces.
*  You can call them area A, area B, area C. You can call them Bantustans.
*  You can call them Native American reservations.
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's the same process.
*  It's the same logic.
*  It's the same racism.
*  I guess the last thing I'd say about the history is that in this unequal struggle, which involves
*  unremitting violence, one of the first leaders of the Zionist movement, a man named Zeb Jabotinsky,
*  the spiritual father of every government since Yitzhak Shamir's government, he said it.
*  We need an iron wall.
*  We need force.
*  Well, we cannot do this.
*  Every native population resists its dispossession.
*  That's not me.
*  That's Jabotinsky.
*  And he said it again and again and again.
*  And that is what has produced Palestinian resistance.
*  Unremitting violence.
*  You cannot have dispossession.
*  You cannot have people's homes and property taken away without the use of violence.
*  You cannot force 750,000 people from their homes without violence.
*  And that is what the Palestinians have suffered in this war.
*  And they've resisted.
*  Sometimes they've been successful.
*  Sometimes they've been unsuccessful.
*  Sometimes that resistance was political or nonviolent.
*  Quite frequently it was violent.
*  Violence inevitably breeds violence.
*  And every time the Palestinians have tried to resist nonviolently, the response was almost
*  more ferocious than violent resistance.
*  Why?
*  If boycott, divestment and sanctions or action before the International Criminal Court or
*  the great march of return in Gaza a couple of years ago when Israeli snipers shot down
*  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of unarmed demonstrators.
*  If those things can succeed, then Israel is naked in a way that it's not when the resistance
*  is violent.
*  So when you ask why do you have violent resistance, you have violent resistance both because in
*  order to impose this step of colonial reality on these people, unremitting, unceasing violence
*  has been applied to them.
*  And because finally people can only take so much.
*  People can only take so much.
*  And so I think that in order to understand this and in order to advocate effectively
*  for this cause, it's really necessary for us to understand all of these things, to understand
*  the legal aspects, the kind of things that Nour Arakat has written about, to understand
*  details about the politics, the kinds of things that many other people have written about
*  and to understand the history.
*  This has been portrayed by a movement that is political, that is national.
*  I'm talking about Zionism, that is economic, that is military, but is also a public relations
*  project.
*  It has sold a picture, what you were talking about, Ta-Nehisi, which people have swallowed
*  with their mother's milk.
*  And it is necessary to deconstruct that.
*  And the only way to do that is to know better than they do the reality of what has been
*  happening in Palestine for more than 100 years.
*  But Ta-Nehisi, can you, well you can respond to that, but also I'm especially interested
*  in your thoughts about the history of black solidarity with the Palestinian struggle and
*  kind of the extent to which you think it's vital for black people to be in solidarity
*  with Palestine and the struggle to free Palestine today.
*  Yeah, well I'll say a couple things.
*  I think it's really important to acknowledge something.
*  And that is that, you know, I'm a relative late comer to this.
*  It's not something that I had a real knowledge of.
*  I had an intuition for it, I had an awareness of the tradition, but it really was not until
*  I went there that I had a tactile feeling for it.
*  One of the things that I will probably be making amends for, until the day they put
*  me in the ground if I'm honest, is in one of my most celebrated works of journalism,
*  when I had to demonstrate tangibly how a reparations program could be done, I looked to Israel.
*  And you know, like I think about that.
*  And one of my golden rules about writing is that you only write after you've reported,
*  you only write after, and I wrote without going.
*  I wrote without going.
*  And so while there is this long tradition of solidarity, for me personally, there's
*  a thing of making amends.
*  And it is terribly ferociously important to me.
*  I think about that and I think about how gracious people were when I was over there.
*  I think about how they took me into their homes.
*  I think about how they fed me.
*  And I think about how their only request was, when you go back, don't lose your voice.
*  That was all they asked.
*  That was all they asked.
*  And so for me, I am obviously aware of the tradition.
*  But this is like personal.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I have some debts to pay.
*  You know?
*  And I think like it's really, really important that I be clear about that.
*  We'll return to this conversation between the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and
*  Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi in a minute.
*  They were speaking at a November 1 event organized by the Palestine Festival of Literature at
*  Union Theological Seminary here in New York, the discussion moderated by the civil rights
*  attorney and author Michelle Alexander.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  As we continue to look at Israel's bombardment of Gaza, we return to a recent conversation
*  between the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi.
*  They spoke at a November 1 event organized by the Palestine Festival of Literature at
*  Union Theological Seminary here in New York, the discussion moderated by the civil rights
*  attorney and author Michelle Alexander.
*  I feel like I came late to my awareness as well.
*  I had heard things, including one time from a friend, a good friend who is not prone to
*  hyperbole, who went to Palestine, returned and said, you know, I was active in the anti-apartheid
*  movement in South Africa and had been to South Africa many times.
*  He says, but what I saw in Israel and Palestine was worse than what I had seen there.
*  And I remember filing that fact away somewhere, what he said, but imagine that the work that
*  I was doing at home was what was most deserving of my attention.
*  And it wasn't until the Ferguson uprisings when I began to hear that activists on the
*  street who were facing tear gas and tanks, they were getting advice from Palestinians
*  halfway across the globe, tweeting to them about how to deal with militaristic occupation
*  and attacks.
*  And following the experience that those activists had in Ferguson, many of them went to Palestine
*  and came back with stories and deep knowledge of the history.
*  And as I began to learn more, I also came to learn that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
*  Committee was staunchly in support of the Palestinian cause, that Muhammad Ali had identified
*  himself as strongly in support of the Palestinian cause, that there was a long tradition of,
*  you know, black activists standing in solidarity with Palestinians.
*  And I have to give a shout out to my sister's new book.
*  She's a historian.
*  She just published a book called Fear of a Black Republic.
*  It's about Haiti and the rise and the birth of black internationalism in the United States.
*  But it is that long history of black people understanding that their struggle for liberation
*  crosses boundaries and that solidarity is necessary across those boundaries, I think,
*  is calling to us now.
*  And the fact that Palestinians were supporting folks in the street of Ferguson and who also,
*  I've heard, were showing their support for people in Flint, Michigan, giving advice about
*  how to survive when your water shut off.
*  And so it's encouraging to me to hear about that kind of international solidarity in this
*  time.
*  Let's turn to some political realities in the United States right now.
*  The United States' support, as we all know, for Israel has been absolutely unwavering
*  for decades, even among supposedly progressive politicians and elected officials.
*  Mark Lamont Hill and Mitchell Plitschnik have written an excellent book called Except for
*  Palestine, the Limits of Progressive Politics.
*  And I'd love to hear from both of you a little bit about these political realities in the
*  United States right now.
*  We are witnessing in real time exactly how unshakable the support is for Israel as the
*  Biden administration refuses to draw any lines in the sand or place any limitations as a
*  country at all on the billions of dollars of aid that we send to Israel every year,
*  even as it commits horrific war times broadcast around the globe.
*  Why is our government not only tolerating this, but sending billions more dollars to
*  Israel?
*  And before you answer, I want to note that I think a clue can be found in a speech that
*  a young U.S. Senator named Joe Biden delivered on the Senate floor in June 1986. It's available
*  on YouTube.
*  He said defiantly, quote, if we look at the Middle East, I think it's about time we stop
*  apologizing for our support for Israel.
*  There is no apology to be made, none.
*  It is the best $3 billion investment we make.
*  Were there not in Israel, the United States of America would have to invent in Israel
*  to protect our interests in the region.
*  The United States would have to go out and invent in Israel, end quote.
*  So what was Biden saying exactly?
*  What do we need to understand about U.S. support for Israel?
*  Hot potato, eh?
*  I think we need to understand a bunch of things.
*  We need to understand that there's a strategic thing there, serves American imperial interests,
*  has always done.
*  That's why the British started this project.
*  They did not do it for the brown eyes of the Jewish people.
*  They did it because it was in the strategic interests of the British Empire.
*  And that's one reason the United States does it.
*  We do not give $3.8 billion a year plus the $10 billion that Biden's asked for additionally
*  this year for anything to do with sentiment.
*  It has to do with strategy.
*  It has to do with oil.
*  It has to do with interests, imperial interests.
*  It has to do with a couple of other things.
*  It does have to do with the evangelical right.
*  It's one of the things that moved Britain to support the Balfour Declaration, to support
*  a Jewish national home in an almost entirely Arab country.
*  And it's one of the things that moves American politicians.
*  The votes, the money, the concentrated political power of the evangelical right.
*  It has to do with money.
*  Our politicians are whores.
*  They're bought and sold.
*  It needs to be said.
*  And the bigger the donor, the more services they get.
*  And that's part of it.
*  And if we ask why is it that our media is so complicit, well, it's partly because our
*  media is an echo chamber for the people in power in Washington.
*  I read the New York Times some mornings and I say the New York Pravda Times.
*  And I read the Washington Post.
*  I read the Washington and Zvezda Post.
*  They are like the Soviet press during the Cold War.
*  They are, whether it's the Ukraine War or whether it's this war, they echo power.
*  But they also echo money.
*  Who owns the Washington Post?
*  Jeff Bezos.
*  Who owns MSNBC?
*  MSNBC.
*  NBCUniversal.
*  Who owns those institutions, those institutions of the press?
*  The same people who own the politicians.
*  The same people who own our universities.
*  Who runs our universities?
*  Who runs our universities?
*  Not the presidents and the deans and the department chairmen and women.
*  It's the board of trustees.
*  What is the board of trustees?
*  It's the same people who finance the politicians.
*  Same people who own the media.
*  So if we see a compliant media with a government that is supportive of Israel because of votes,
*  because of the evangelical right, because of imperial strategic objectives, it's very
*  simple.
*  When we see university administrations kowtowing to one narrative on Palestine, as they have
*  done right across the country, it's for the same reason that our media does it.
*  And the same reason that our government does it.
*  It's money.
*  It's power.
*  It's very, very, very simple.
*  I can give you a more sophisticated explanation, but I think that that really sums it up, frankly.
*  I don't have a better answer than that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's interesting because I reflect on the fact that...
*  Can I say something?
*  I hope I did not insult sex workers.
*  I did not mean to do that.
*  I did not mean to do that.
*  I'm very sorry.
*  They're far above politicians.
*  Well, I think we should probably spend a minute talking about censorship.
*  Fear and censorship.
*  I know that both of you have significant experience with censorship.
*  I do too.
*  And we have seen in recent years the censorship of books labeled critical race theory, which
*  turned out to be a very broad category.
*  Books about LGBTQ people and issues.
*  Kind of the scope of censorship keeps broadening.
*  But we are seeing now kind of new forms or very old forms of being born again of censorship
*  in this kind of war context.
*  And I do worry about the possibility of us entering into another McCarthy era, the challenges
*  of finding a site just for this conversation.
*  I think speak to the real risk of that.
*  And I wonder if both of you...
*  And I'll start with you.
*  Say a little bit about where you think we are right now in terms of censorship.
*  And as was mentioned earlier, people have real fears, fears that are grounded in reality.
*  The possibility of losing jobs, of retaliation, and even being attacked violently or killed
*  as a result of expressing their views.
*  Where are we now in terms of censorship?
*  What do you fear?
*  And how do you think people ought to respond in this moment in time?
*  You know, Ali, I think we're in a great place.
*  And I don't say that blithely.
*  I say that, as you mentioned, having some very, very direct experience with my own work
*  being banned in schools and libraries.
*  And then this week, helping where I could, and ultimately, you know, it was you, Michelle,
*  but trying to figure out where we could hold this event and seeing Yasmin go through all
*  of the hoops.
*  So, what I've gleaned from that is when people start resorting to instruments as blunt and
*  direct as book bands or not allowing discussions, they're threatened.
*  It's the weapon of a weak and a decaying order.
*  Now, I'll just tell you a little something.
*  I never forget.
*  I came back, right?
*  I come back from Palestine.
*  It's like, you know, late May, and I'm going crazy.
*  Like I'm going to sleep, and I'm, you know, dreaming about Palestine, and I'm, you know,
*  waking up, and I got that glassy-eyed look in my face, and my wife is worried about me,
*  and everybody's worried about me.
*  And I emailed a friend, and I said, do you have a contact with Rashid Khalidi at all?
*  And he said, yeah, I do.
*  And he connected us, and I wrote him.
*  I said, you don't know me from Adam?
*  I got to talk to somebody about what I saw.
*  And he said, it's okay.
*  He said, look, I'm having a dinner this weekend.
*  I want you and your wife come.
*  And I came, and we sat in community, and it was the thing that I needed.
*  And among the many things that she said that night, he said, I have been fighting this
*  fight for a long time, and I've never seen our side this strong.
*  I've never seen the students at the university so galvanized.
*  I've never...
*  You can confuse the ferociousness of the pushback with strength.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But the fact of the matter is, in African-American history, for instance, here in our struggle,
*  the struggle is the most violent when people are the most threatened.
*  The original and the oldest and the most lethal form of domestic terrorism was pioneered
*  after the Civil War.
*  And what it was was in response to the fact that suddenly you had multiple states throughout
*  this country with black majorities.
*  You had a majority black legislature in South Carolina.
*  The pushback had to be ferocious.
*  It had to be violent.
*  It needed to be because of the sheer strength of the threat.
*  That's generally been our history.
*  Now in this moment, when I look out and I see not just my work band, but I see the work
*  of my colleagues' band, I see, as you mentioned, LGBTQ authors' band.
*  When I situate myself within the history of black writing, and I understand the fact that
*  there was never any safe moment for black writing in this country's history.
*  When I understand that when Frederick Douglass publishes his narrative and he goes and he
*  talks about it, he has a price on it.
*  He can be dragged back into slavery at any moment.
*  When I understand that Ida B. Wells was driven out of Memphis, Tennessee for reporting on
*  the lynching and the murder of her friends, and she continued to report on it nonetheless.
*  When I understand that Elijah Lovejoy was shot to death and his press was shoved into
*  the river, you have to be realistic about this moment.
*  What happened to you, man?
*  You had to find another location for your talk tonight.
*  That was it.
*  It's actually quite simple compared to the long history of things.
*  My wife was kind enough to send me an article about this district where they had banned
*  Between the World and Me, right?
*  This is a deep red district.
*  There had been this whole fight about it.
*  They went and interviewed the librarian.
*  The librarian said, this is the most checked out book we've ever had.
*  It's not because of me, it's because of the band.
*  You understand what I'm saying?
*  So the very fact that you guys are here, the very unfortunate fact that some of you who
*  are watching this couldn't get in.
*  The fact that we had the struggle to find a venue for this event doesn't say anything
*  about the strength of this movement here.
*  It doesn't say anything about our strength.
*  It says a lot about the threat and what people feel and the weakness.
*  So, I don't know.
*  I like...
*  Anybody that knows me knows that I am not one known for my optimism.
*  But I feel it in this moment.
*  I really do.
*  I mean, I don't have much to say after that.
*  But I'm completely convinced that Thadneese is right.
*  The first thing is this idea that the international community supports what Israel is doing.
*  Acts as if the United States, Western Europe and a few white settler colonies in Japan
*  are the international community.
*  They aren't.
*  They're a pimple on the backside of humanity.
*  The international community is India and China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Congo, Nigeria, Brazil.
*  I could go on.
*  Those are the people who voted in the United Nations for a ceasefire.
*  120 countries.
*  There were 14...
*  There were 14 that voted against.
*  Six island nations.
*  The United States, Israel and a bunch of hangars on.
*  That's not the world.
*  The world is actually with us.
*  Indeed, in this country.
*  The press? No.
*  The politicians? No.
*  The universities? Certainly no.
*  And by that I mean the administrations.
*  But look at the campus that I teach on.
*  Five years ago, Columbia students voted overwhelmingly in support of boycott, divestment and sanctions
*  of companies that support the occupation.
*  Overwhelmingly.
*  Same thing happened at Brown.
*  Same thing happened at Barnard.
*  Same thing happened at Michigan.
*  Same thing happened at almost every university where the thing was put to a vote.
*  The students are with us.
*  By a vote, we know that.
*  I was on television the other day for my sins.
*  It's a terrible thing to go on television.
*  I promise you, don't do it if you don't have to.
*  And I mentioned that young people are with us.
*  And God bless her.
*  The interviewer said to me, yeah, there's a poll here that says on Biden's handling of the Gaza situation
*  in the age group from 18 to 35, he has 10% support.
*  10%!
*  I could give you more polls.
*  They are terrified of us.
*  That's why we're getting censorship.
*  We've got to close now.
*  I think as we sit here, in the center of the most powerful empire in the world,
*  we need to think about what our responsibility is,
*  as King said in his speech, to those who have been defined as our enemy,
*  and consider not just what we must say, but what we must do.
*  And I'm wondering if you have thoughts that you want to share.
*  I do. Thank you.
*  One of the things that I argue in this book that you mentioned
*  is this is not a war on the Palestinians waged by the Zionist movement or Israel alone.
*  It's a war waged on the Palestinian people by Israel and the United States.
*  Those are our weapons.
*  Those are American F-35s, American F-15s, American F-16s, American 175mm guns, American 155mm guns.
*  They fire shells of 100 pounds each.
*  I could tell you their kill radius.
*  I could tell you how large the diameter of a 2,000 pound bomb dropped from an American plane is.
*  That's us, our tax dollars, our votes.
*  We must oppose with action, with words, not just weapons that we send to Israel to kill people with,
*  being used in that way, incidentally in violation of U.S. law.
*  U.S. law mandates that weapons can only be used for defensive purposes.
*  Why do you think they keep saying in every one of their statements
*  that Israel has a right to defend itself?
*  Because otherwise they would be in violation of U.S. law in sending those weapons to Israel.
*  If killing children in Jabalia camp is a defensive purpose, then it's legal.
*  And if it's not, they're in violation of the law.
*  We must oppose that and we must oppose the possibility of the United States being complicit in ethnic cleansing.
*  We must oppose it as strongly as we can.
*  Otherwise, we are the ethnic cleansers and we are the killers.
*  We may not be the ones pulling the trigger.
*  We may not be the people forcing people out into Egypt or into Jordan, but we are responsible.
*  Our government has just said that it's willing to fund that.
*  Now, maybe they'll pull back on it, but they'll only pull back on it if we make them stop.
*  Thank you.
*  That was Columbia University Professor Rashid Khalidi in conversation with the acclaimed writer
*  Tanahasi Coates at a November 1 event organized by the Palestine Festival of Literature
*  at Union Theological Seminary here in New York.
*  The discussion was moderated by the civil rights attorney and author Michelle Alexander.
*  Thank you.
