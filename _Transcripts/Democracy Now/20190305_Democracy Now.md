# “How to Hide an Empire”: Daniel Immerwahr on the History of the Greater United States
**Democracy Now!:** [March 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvlUGYvLg0s)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  How to Hide an Empire, a History of the Greater United States.
*  That's the title of a stunning new book looking at a part of the U.S. that is often
*  overlooked, the nation's overseas territories, from Puerto Rico to Guam, former territories
*  like the Philippines and its hundreds of military bases scattered across the globe.
*  Captain Daniel Imrevar writes in his new book,
*  At various times, the inhabitants of the U.S. empire have been shot, shelled, starved,
*  interned, dispossessed, tortured and experimented on.
*  What they haven't been, by and large, is seen, he writes.
*  Daniel Imrevar is associate professor of history at Northwestern University in Chicago.
*  He joins us from Chicago.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!
*  It's great to have you with us.
*  Why don't you start with the title?
*  How to Hide an Empire?
*  How do you do it?
*  And what a history of the greater United States means?
*  Yeah.
*  So, when a lot of people think about the United States, people who live in the U.S. mainland,
*  people outside of the United States, they think of the contiguous blob.
*  It's a familiar shape.
*  But of course, those aren't the borders of the country.
*  And actually, they've only been the borders of the country for three years of U.S. history.
*  So what I tried to do was write a history of the greater United States, of the full
*  area over which the United States claims jurisdiction.
*  But what I found as I was writing that was how frequently people on the mainland, and
*  often political leaders, had an inaccurate view of their own country's borders, or at
*  least had a very clear sense that the contiguous part of the United States, the states, was
*  the part that mattered, and the territories were sort of peripheral, often regarded or
*  not fully understood, and left to dwindle as sacrifice zones or, you know, places that
*  could be used for medical experiments and that sort of thing.
*  So my goal is to try to tell U.S. history with all the territory as part of the story.
*  Well, Professor Amovar, one of the things that you raise is that really the question
*  of the creation of an empire did not really begin when it's—most histories talk about
*  it with the Spanish-American War of 1898, but you go earlier into the colonization across
*  really, and you note that the Constitution doesn't have a whole lot to say about what
*  happens to territories that are not states except for the territorial clause, but that
*  the Northwest Ordinance played a big role in shaping how the United States would expand.
*  Could you talk about that?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  So the name of the country from the get-go was the United States of America, but from
*  the first day of the country's history, from the first day when the United States
*  received its independence from Britain, it wasn't a union of states.
*  It was an amalgamation of states and territories.
*  There wasn't a lot of guidance in the Constitution about what was to be done with the territories,
*  but ultimately they're under the power of Congress.
*  Northwest Ordinance set a pattern whereby territories could be upgraded to states, but
*  two things were notable about that pattern.
*  First of all, in order to be upgraded to states, according to the Northwest Ordinance, they
*  had to be populated by white people.
*  So the idea was that non-white populations within them wouldn't really count, and it
*  wasn't until the territories were sufficiently populated by white people that they would
*  be accepted as states.
*  The other really important thing to realize is that's just a guidance.
*  Congress can do whatever it wants, and it has done whatever it wants.
*  It has held territories back from statehood, often for decades.
*  Oklahoma took more than a century before it became a state, and it has promoted others
*  to statehood quickly.
*  Really just as a way of sort of curating the borders of the country, of deciding who's
*  in and who's out.
*  And you mentioned Oklahoma.
*  There was an attempt during the early 1900s to create a state called Sequoia in parts
*  of what is now Oklahoma.
*  Talk about that and the reason why that never happened.
*  That's right.
*  So Oklahoma used to be called Indian Country or Indian Territory.
*  That was its legal name.
*  And that territory used to be enormous.
*  Forty-six percent of the country when it was initially established.
*  And then it was fairly quickly whittled down into the borders of present-day Oklahoma.
*  And right at the end of this process, a sort of compressed group of various Indian polities
*  tried to create a state out of what was then eastern Oklahoma and called Sequoia.
*  It wouldn't be an all-Indian state or all-Native American state.
*  It would be mixed.
*  But their hope was that at least they'd have a sufficient population to have a governing
*  majority within it.
*  They applied for statehood.
*  They were rejected for statehood.
*  And instead, Sequoia was absorbed into the white majority state of Oklahoma.
*  Professor Amovar, talk about why you begin with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
*  And take us through what are now called, well, various things, but territories, what were
*  called colonies, and the language changed.
*  But start with Pearl Harbor.
*  Yeah, it's such an extraordinary moment, because it's one of the most familiar moments
*  in U.S. history.
*  And when most people of the United States think about Pearl Harbor, what they think
*  about is Japan attacked the United States, and it attacked it by bombing Pearl Harbor,
*  and that drew the United States into the war.
*  And that was the only time that the United States was directly attacked in the war.
*  But of course, what actually happened is it wasn't just Hawaii that Japan was attacking.
*  Japan was launching an attack on the United States' Pacific territories, as well as Britain's
*  Pacific territories in Thailand.
*  So in a near simultaneous attack—this all happened within hours—the Japanese attacked
*  the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, and Hawaii.
*  And the attack on the Philippines militarily was just as bad as the attack on Hawaii.
*  And for that reason, it was unclear to reporters initially how to say what happened.
*  If you look at the early newspapers that, you know, some of them say the Japanese attack
*  others say Japanese attacked the Philippines and Hawaii.
*  That notion that the Philippines and Hawaii were the really important targets to emphasize,
*  that's how it appears in Eleanor Roosevelt's first speech.
*  That's how it appears in a draft of the Pearl Harbor speech that FDR's undersecretary of
*  state wrote.
*  And that's how it appeared in FDR's own first draft of the speech, emphasizing both
*  targets.
*  But what's amazing is that you can see FDR going through—thinking through that, thinking
*  through the implications of trying to explain to the country that the Philippines had been
*  attacked and this was cause for the United States to go to war.
*  And it seems to me that he's quite clearly uncomfortable with that implication, worrying
*  whether an attack on the Philippines would really count as a cause for war in the United
*  States.
*  And we have a lot of opinion polls from the time, which suggest that most people who were
*  living in the U.S. mainland didn't want to see the U.S. military come to the defense
*  of the far western territories of the United States, like the Philippines and Guam.
*  So what FDR did is two things.
*  First of all, he crossed out prominent references to the Philippines and just focused it on
*  Hawaii.
*  Hawaii was also a territory, not a state, but it had significantly larger white population
*  and it was closer to the mainland.
*  And then, even then, it seems like he felt a little nervous about whether Hawaii would
*  count as the United States for the purposes of, you know, rallying the nation to war.
*  And indeed, opinion polls suggest that only 55 percent of the country thought the U.S.
*  territory should defend the territory of Hawaii in the case of war.
*  So he inserted the word American in his descriptor.
*  So it's not just the Japanese bomb, as it initially said in his speech, the island of
*  Oahu, but that they bomb the American island of Oahu.
*  So you can see what he's doing is trying to round Hawaii up to American and the Philippines
*  and Guam.
*  He kind of regards as, you know, too far gone and just takes them out from prominent references
*  of the speech and tucks them in the back.
*  I think that has a lot to do with why a lot of people in the United States today don't
*  realize that that attack was not just on Hawaii alone.
*  And it's a real pity that they don't realize it, because the attack on Pearl Harbor was
*  just that.
*  It was an attack.
*  The Japanese never came back.
*  It was militarily damaging, but it didn't result in Hawaii being invaded.
*  That's not true of the Philippines, Guam, or Wake Island, all of which were attacked,
*  all of which were conquered.
*  Populations were interned.
*  The occupation of the Philippines by Japan was an absolutely brutal affair.
*  The occupation and the subsequent U.S. reconquest of the Philippines, we think, killed, you
*  know, maybe a million and a half people, as best we can tell, which is two—you know,
*  two times the number of people who died in the Civil War.
*  That's the bloodiest event that ever happened on U.S. soil, and that's barely in the U.S.
*  history textbooks.
*  And the Philippines became independent in 1946 from the United States.
*  People might be surprised to know.
*  It's so recent.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I often found that I would talk to people with Ph.D.s in U.S. history, and I would just
*  say, you know, if they didn't study the colonies, I'd say, you know, do you know
*  what the largest colony that the United States has held and what decade it became independent?
*  And I got a lot of people who were scratching their heads, because it's not usually emphasized
*  when we talk about U.S. history.
*  We often talk about U.S. empire in a sort of broader and more diffuse sense.
*  But surprisingly, a lot of U.S. historians don't have a lot of knowledge about the
*  actual colonies themselves.
*  Well, in terms of the independence of the Philippines in 1946, this whole issue of which
*  territories became states versus which either were held as territories or became independent
*  really pivoted around—and you mentioned it in your book—a group of Supreme Court
*  decisions that are rarely studied these days, the Insular Cases, in the early 1900s that
*  determined which were incorporated versus unincorporated territories.
*  Could you talk about that, the significance of those decisions for the justifying an American
*  empire?
*  Yeah.
*  So, after the United States, in a sort of imperial shopping spree, acquired a number
*  of large populated colonies—the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam—the Supreme Court
*  had to figure out where these places stood within the fabric of the nation.
*  They're part of the United States, but does that mean Filipinos can vote for the president?
*  Does that mean they're covered by the Constitution?
*  It wasn't clear, and there were a lot of arguments about it.
*  So the Supreme Court ultimately came down with this, that the Constitution applies to
*  the United States.
*  It's the law of the lands.
*  But some of the territories, namely the ones that have been acquired from Spain—so Puerto
*  Rico, Guam, Philippines—and this would also extend to American Samoa and later to the
*  U.S. Virgin Islands and other places—that those were not part of the land.
*  So the Constitution applies to the land, but these are not part of the United States in
*  a constitutional sense.
*  And therefore, they're possessed by the United States.
*  The United States encompasses them within its borders, but its Constitution doesn't
*  fully extend to them.
*  Some of the territories, Hawaii and Alaska, which had larger white settler populations,
*  were deemed to be incorporated, meaning that the Constitution would extend to them, and
*  that seemed to make them more eligible for statehood.
*  But even in those cases, it wasn't entirely clear in the early part of the 20th century
*  that Hawaii or Alaska would ever become states.
*  And in fact, there was a lot of racist resistance in the U.S. mainland to the notion that people
*  from Hawaii might get to vote on federal laws.
*  In your book, you show two maps of the United States, one of just the mainland United States
*  — the other with all of the territories included.
*  The captions read,
*  They told you it was this, but it's this.
*  And explain the significance of this and how this fits into the map of U.S. military bases
*  around the world.
*  The U.S. has what?
*  Something like around 800 overseas military bases.
*  By comparison, Russia has nine.
*  Those countries have none.
*  That's right.
*  So I found that in writing this book, well, first of all, I had to learn how to make maps,
*  because I wanted to see the United States differently than I'd been—had it presented
*  to me.
*  I grew up in Pennsylvania.
*  At no point in my education did I see a map of the United States that had Puerto Rico
*  on it.
*  Puerto Rico has been part of the United States since 1899.
*  So I wanted to just try to imagine the country differently, to see it differently, to map
*  it differently.
*  And so one thing I did was an equal area projection showing all the territory of the United States.
*  And what's remarkable—this map was from 1940—what's remarkable is how much just
*  physical landmass of the United States was at that point in overseas territories—Alaska,
*  Hawaii, the Philippines.
*  And you can do a similarly surprising map today.
*  The parts of the United States that are not states don't take up as much land area today,
*  but the United States controls hundreds of specks of land on islands in foreign countries.
*  And it's really easy not to think about that.
*  If you take all that land and you mash it all together, it probably adds up to less
*  than the area of Connecticut.
*  It's not a lot of space.
*  But boy, is that land area important, both for the U.S. military and also for all the
*  countries and people who live right around that land and have to deal with outposts of
*  the United States that are peppered throughout the world.
*  Well, Professor Emefor, I wanted to ask you about the chapter in your book titled Language
*  is a Virus.
*  Obviously, when countries conquer other peoples who speak different languages, there's an
*  issue of what happens to the language and the culture of the conquered or absorbed populations.
*  And you talk in your books much on the issue of the English language and how the absorption
*  first of French-speakers in Louisiana, of the native peoples, of the Puerto Ricans and
*  the Philippines, how the language issue began to be dealt with.
*  Yeah, it's an important thing to recognize that one of the things that empires do is
*  they try to enforce a sort of homogeneity.
*  They try to export the standards of the motherland onto the colonies, and often that's a violent
*  and difficult process.
*  Certainly, that's been true in the United States and its territories, that it's sought
*  to export and enforce English.
*  One of the more dramatic instances of this is on Guam, where we have accounts of a naval
*  officer who went around burning all English Chamorro dictionaries as a way to try to extirpate
*  the local language and enforce English.
*  And there's all kinds of accounts of various colonial subjects being forcibly moved onto
*  English language-only schools, being physically punished if they speak their native language
*  rather than English.
*  What's really interesting about that, however, is not only the way that the United States
*  has done, as many empires have done, to try to enforce its languages in its colonies,
*  but that actually the United States has been remarkably successful in enforcing its language
*  outside of its colonies, too, after World War II.
*  The history of the last 50 years or so has given rise to the remarkable spread of the
*  English language, not just in places that the United States has physically controlled,
*  but in far distant places that it hasn't controlled.
*  I wanted to talk about one of the people you focus on in your book as a way to talk about
*  colonialism, Cornelius Rhodes, the doctor, the cancer researcher, who went to San Juan,
*  Puerto Rico, to study anemia in the 1930s.
*  Tell us what he did there and how he ascended from there.
*  That's right.
*  So Cornelius Rhodes was working for the Rockefeller Institute, and he went to San Juan in the
*  1930s to research anemia.
*  A lot of Puerto Ricans were suffering from anemia as a result of hookworm.
*  And he took his—you know, he'd been trained in Harvard, but suddenly when he got to San
*  Juan, he became a different kind of doctor.
*  He took his location, being in Puerto Rico, as sort of license to do whatever he wanted,
*  however he wanted it.
*  So this is what we have accounts of.
*  First of all, he refused to treat some of his patients, just to see what would happen.
*  He tried to induce disease in others, again, to see what would happen by restricting their
*  diets.
*  He referred to his patients, to his colleagues, as experimental animals.
*  And then he wrote a letter.
*  He sat down and he wrote a letter in which he said to a colleague in Boston, he said,
*  you know, Puerto Rico is beautiful.
*  The weather is incredible.
*  I love the islands.
*  However, the problem is with the Puerto Ricans.
*  They're awful.
*  They steal.
*  They're filthy.
*  And the thing to do, really, is to totally exterminate the population.
*  And then he said—and I started that—I've killed eight of my patients, and I've sought
*  to transplant cancer into 13 more.
*  I hope you're doing well in Boston.
*  Yours sincerely.
*  And just signed off.
*  We know that, because he then left the letter out.
*  It was discovered.
*  It was discovered by the Puerto Rican staff of the hospital where he was working.
*  And it became a national scandal, understandably.
*  Puerto Ricans had heard the scorn of mainlanders.
*  They'd heard talk of the problem of Puerto Rican overpopulation and how mainlanders disapproved
*  of it.
*  But here they saw what they interpreted to be the homicidal—racist homicidal intent
*  from a doctor who'd actually killed eight people.
*  Cornelius Rhodes left.
*  He just fled the islands, hoping, presumably, that what happens in San Juan stays in San
*  Juan.
*  The government did an investigation.
*  It uncovered another letter, which the governor deemed worse than the first.
*  But the governor, who was appointed governor—he's a mainlander who's been appointed and not
*  elected—suppressed that letter.
*  We don't have it.
*  No researcher has ever seen it or found it and concluded, after having suppressed evidence,
*  that Cornelius Rhodes probably didn't kill eight of his patients.
*  He was probably just joking or something like that.
*  And Cornelius Rhodes never faced a hearing.
*  Not only that, he didn't even get fired.
*  So he returned to New York.
*  He continued his job.
*  He was quickly—he quickly became the vice president of the New York Academy of Medicine.
*  And then, during World War II, he became a colonel in the Army and became a chief medical
*  officer in the Chemical Warfare Service.
*  So that's not only a promotion.
*  Just think about what that allows him to do, because the Chemical Warfare Service is preparing
*  the United States to enter a gas war if it comes to that.
*  So in order to do that, it tests out all kinds of poison gas, first on animals—goats are
*  but ultimately on human subjects, on uniformed men who are, without a lot of informed consent,
*  either having mustard agents apply to their skin to see how their skin blisters, are put
*  in gas chambers with gas masks to see how long they can stay in there.
*  They're locked in there until they falter.
*  Or in a lot of cases, there's an island that the United States uses off of Panama,
*  San Jose Island, and men are put in the field and they're asked to sort of stage mock
*  battles.
*  But while they do that, they're gassed from overhead, and then, you know, this is to see
*  how they're affected.
*  And interestingly, Professor Amovar, there were many Puerto Ricans who served in World
*  War II who ended up stationed in Panama and being subjected to some of the mustard gas
*  experiments that were conducted at that time.
*  I know, because one of my uncles, who served in the 65th Infantry, was in Panama and was
*  subjected to those experiments.
*  So, it's—the interesting thing, though, is that Cornelius Rhodes remained a major
*  figure, didn't he, in the medical world?
*  And way up into—only recently, only in recent years has there been an attempt to sort of
*  revise or reform the image of him in the medical community.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So after overseeing these medical experiments with gas, in which 60,000 uniformed men, a
*  lot of them Puerto Rican, were subjected without informed consent to chemical weapons, and
*  many of them suffered debilitating effects as a result of this.
*  Emphysema, eye damage, genital scarring, psychological damage.
*  Some of these men were really harmed by this.
*  Nevertheless, that also didn't impede him.
*  And in fact, some of that work with chemical agents alerted him, as well as some other
*  doctors, to the possibility that mustard agents could be used to treat cancer.
*  Cornelius Rhodes took some of the surplus stock of U.S. chemical weapons after the war
*  and became the first director of the Sloan Kettering Institute, and then used his position
*  to sort of launch the—you know, turn to chemotherapy, and tried chemical after chemical
*  after chemical out on fighting cancer.
*  The incredible thing is that within the U.S. medical community, that's what he was remembered
*  for.
*  He appeared on the cover of Time magazine.
*  There was an award given by the American Association of Cancer Research after Cornelius Rhodes.
*  And that award was given for more than 20 years before a Puerto Rican cancer researcher
*  pointed out to the AACR, you know the guy after whom this award is named, the hero Cornelius
*  Rhodes, you know what he did in Puerto Rico?
*  And it had been 23 years.
*  The informational segregation had been so extraordinary that it had been 23 years before
*  the mainland medical community realized that the guy that they'd been enthusiastically
*  celebrating had at least said in a letter that he'd killed eight of his patients.
*  The medical community has, you know, now gotten the memo, and there's been—the award has
*  been changed, and now there's an understanding of his dual legacy.
*  But what's extraordinary to me is just how long he got away with it.
*  Just how long he was able, and how many Puerto Ricans he was able to experiment on in some
*  of the worst ways imaginable without facing the consequences of that.
*  So, as we talk about Puerto Rico, let's talk about this issue of the language used,
*  moving the language from colonies to territories, and even when Donald Trump is speaking, when
*  President Trump is speaking, how he refers to those in these territories.
*  I mean, a place like Puerto Rico, when you talk about the Constitution or Guantanamo
*  in Cuba being outside the Constitution, in your book, you're talking about—this is
*  clearly something Juan has known all of his life, but you don't even have trial by jury
*  in Puerto Rico.
*  The constitutional right to trial by jury doesn't apply to Puerto Rico.
*  So I'm from Pennsylvania, but if I were to travel to San Juan, I would lose that right
*  upon arriving in Puerto Rico.
*  And that issue of the changing language, from colonies to talking about them as territories,
*  the leadership of the United States understanding what the language meant, and then President
*  Trump referring to, for example, Puerto Rico and some astounding quotes about Puerto Rico
*  as you, them.
*  Yeah, let's talk about that.
*  So, when the United States initially acquires the bulk of its overseas territories, those
*  territories are referred to by the leaders of the United States, people like Teddy Roosevelt,
*  Woodrow Wilson, in a really forthright way.
*  They're called colonies, because, of course, that's what they are.
*  And these men are forthright defenders of empire and are very proud and happy to call
*  the overseas possessions of the United States colonies.
*  But that doesn't last very long.
*  By about the 1910s or so, you see government officials becoming very nervous about the
*  C word and seeking to replace it with euphemisms.
*  So territory is a gentler term.
*  Legally, there's not an important distinction in U.S. law, but it's a term that at least,
*  you know, seems consonant with the fabric of the United States.
*  Kansas had been a territory.
*  Montana had been a territory.
*  And they're states.
*  So the practice in the United States has been, since the early 20th century, to refer to
*  parts of the United States as territories rather than as colonies.
*  But nevertheless, there's still a clear sense from the leaders of the United States that
*  such places don't really fit in the country.
*  And Trump isn't the first person to enunciate that, but like with so many other things,
*  Trump kind of says the quiet parts out loud.
*  So after the hurricane damage, both hurricanes, Irma and Maria, damaged Puerto Rico, you know,
*  Trump had to sort of speak about this.
*  He does this remarkable thing where when he addresses Puerto Rico, he refers to it in
*  the second person.
*  So I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget out of whack.
*  Now, of course, Puerto Rico is part of the United States.
*  Puerto Ricans have been citizens for over a century.
*  Nevertheless, in Trump's mind, it's very clear that there's a homeland, which is the kind
*  of place you can build a wall around, the contiguous United States.
*  And then there are these other parts of the United States which seem to him to be foreign.
*  Another really good example of this is after a federal judge in Hawaii blocked Trump's
*  travel ban, Jeff Sessions expressed amazement that a judge sitting on a Pacific island could
*  block the president.
*  Of course, that has to do with the notion that Hawaii isn't really part of the United
*  States.
*  Well, and talking about Pacific islands, talk about these specs of land and these islands
*  and these territories where sometimes they're not even people, but yet they are critical
*  or important to the United States, have strategic value and are considered territories of the
*  United States.
*  Yeah, I think that's important to remember that the United States has inhabited territories.
*  It has five of them, but it also has a lot of just other land, including uninhabited
*  islands.
*  And that's, in fact, the first U.S. entry into overseas empire.
*  The familiar borders of the United States, the ones you picture in your mind when you
*  think of the country, those were sort of finally filled out in 1854 with the Gadsden Purchase.
*  But three years later, the United States started claiming overseas territory in the form of
*  uninhabited islands.
*  In this case, they were called Guano Islands because they were sort of islands that birds
*  landed on and deposited for centuries, feces that just sort of piled higher and higher,
*  dried in the sun, and was an incredibly useful source of fertilizer.
*  So in pursuit of this fertilizer, the United States claimed nearly 100 Guano Islands in
*  the Caribbean and in the Pacific.
*  They were useful for fertilizer and not much else in the 19th century.
*  But in the 20th century, it turned out that the same features of those islands that made
*  them attractive to birds, small islands in the middle of an oceanic desert, good places
*  to land, made them also really useful for planes.
*  So the United States has repurposed some of those islands as military bases, as places
*  to store nuclear weapons, as places to land planes.
*  In fact, it was on her way to one of those Guano Islands, Howland Island, that Amelia
*  Earhart's plane went down.
*  And that makes sense, right?
*  Howland Island is seemingly nowhere, you know, next to nothing, a remote island in
*  the Pacific.
*  But if you're trying to fly a plane across the Pacific, having Howland Island is really
*  important.
*  Well, we hear a lot about this China trying to build, extend a landing, an airstrip in
*  small islands off the coast of China.
*  But the United States has been doing this around the world for decades and decades,
*  hasn't it?
*  Yeah, so I think if you were to characterize the United States' territorial empire today,
*  I think you could call it a sort of pointillist empire, in that it consists mainly of islands
*  and bases, just small specks where the United States can move, can stage its things, can
*  put transceivers, can store things.
*  And China's taking a page from that book.
*  China doesn't have the same territorial extent that the United States has.
*  It doesn't have the same kind of history in the 20th century of, you know, getting
*  to claim all these islands.
*  So China's doing something really interesting, which is it's making its own islands.
*  It's actually creating artificial islands that serve the same purpose, that can be used
*  as little points, as military bases, as a way for China to extend its influence by having
*  these little specks of land.
*  And finally, we just have 30 seconds, but from the beetles to the peace symbol, explain
*  its connection to colonies and air bases.
*  So, it turns out that these specks of land not just—don't just matter for the U.S.
*  military, they matter a lot for the people who've lived around them.
*  And what I found in my book was that both the peace symbol and the beetles are in some
*  ways artifacts of the U.S. basing system, the peace symbol as a reaction to the fear
*  of U.S. military bases and the beetles as a band that grew up in the shadow of the largest
*  U.S. Air Force base in Europe.
