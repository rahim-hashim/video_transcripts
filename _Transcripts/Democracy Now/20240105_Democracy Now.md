*  Israeli officials have reportedly held talks with a number of African nations, including
*  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Chad, about accepting Palestinians pushed

*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his cabinet members have promoted

*  But Palestinians and human rights groups have decried the plan as ethnic cleansing.
*  This comes as Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hoteveli, has openly
*  embraced destroying the whole of Gaza.
*  She made the comment during an interview on the London radio station LBC.
*  One of the things we realized is that every school, every mosque, every second house has
*  an access to tunnel.
*  So this is—and, of course, ammunition—
*  But that's an argument for destroying the whole of Gaza, every single building in it.
*  So do you have another solution, how to destroy the underground tunnel city, that this is
*  the place where the terrorists hide?
*  Meanwhile, the Biden administration has criticized South Africa for filing a genocide case against
*  Israel at the International Court of Justice.
*  National Security Council coordinator, Admiral John Kirby, was asked about the case on Wednesday.
*  South Africa has filed this 84-page lawsuit against Israel, accusing them of genocide.
*  Israel says that this is blood libel.
*  Does Washington agree?
*  And where does this put Washington and Pretoria in terms of—
*  Do you find this submission meritless, counterproductive and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever?
*  In other news from Israel, an Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas for 51 days
*  is calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare a ceasefire.
*  Aviva Siegel spoke to PBS NewsHour.
*  But he can't keep the war going and get the hostages out.

*  necessary action to protect our personnel.

*  Civil rights leader Al Sharpton led a protest Thursday outside the New York office of the
*  billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who helped lead a campaign that led to this week's

*  Harvard and other schools for supporting DEI.
*  That's diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
*  Al Sharpton vowed to keep protesting outside Ackman's office.
*  I've started these weekly one-hour protests in front of Mr. Ackman's office.
*  He has said that the resignation of Dr. Gay at Harvard is not the end of it.
*  They're going to keep fighting to the end DEI, which is diversity, equity and inclusion.
*  That's declaring a war on all of us, blacks, women, gays.
*  DEI was designed to bring fairness and equality to people that had been historically
*  marginalized and eliminated.
*  Sharpton was standing in front of someone holding a Haitian flag as part of his campaign
*  to oust Claudine Gay as Harvard president.
*  She's the daughter of Haitian immigrants.
*  Bill Ackman helped amplify allegations that Gay had committed plagiarism in her academic work.

*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams has sued 12 charter bus companies for $700 million,
*  accusing them of illegally transporting over 30,000 migrants from Texas at the behest of
*  Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott.
*  Adams accused Abbott of using the migrants as political pawns.

*  to care for migrants bussed here in the last two years by the state of Texas.

*  Saturday marks the third anniversary of the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
*  President Biden is planning to mark the anniversary by giving a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania,
*  the Revolutionary War Site where George Washington and the Continental Army camped over the winter
*  of 1777-1778, enduring harsh conditions. Meanwhile, voters in Massachusetts and Illinois
*  have filed paperwork challenging Donald Trump's eligibility for running for office, citing the
*  Insurrection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Trump is already appealing decisions in Colorado and
*  Maine to remove him from the ballot. Newly unsealed documents related to the
*  deceased convicted sex trafficker and financier Jeffrey Epstein includes a reference to reports
*  that former President Bill Clinton once threatened Vanity Fair Magazine against reporting on Epstein.
*  One new document contains an email sent by Virginia Jufri, who had accused Epstein of
*  trafficking her to Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old. In the email, Jufri writes about why
*  she was worried about speaking to Vanity Fair. She wrote, quote,
*  It does concern me what they could want to write about me, considering that B. Clinton walked into
*  VF and threatened them not to write sex trafficking articles about his good friend J.E.
*  Former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter has denied the incident ever took place.
*  In Iowa, a sixth-grade student died Thursday in a school shooting in the town of Perry on the first
*  day of classes after winter break. Five other people were injured, including the school's principal.
*  Police say the gunman was a 17-year-old student who came to school armed with a pump-action
*  shotgun and a small-caliber handgun. Police say the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
*  And in Berkeley, California, police raided the historic People's Park early Thursday morning,
*  ending a long standoff between the University of California Berkeley and community activists.
*  There were reports at least seven people were arrested. Many unhoused people were displaced.
*  In the 60s, People's Park was at the center of the anti-war and free speech movements in Berkeley.
*  The UC Berkeley officials have now placed shipping containers around the perimeter of the park where
*  the school plans to build new student housing. And those are some of the headlines. This is
