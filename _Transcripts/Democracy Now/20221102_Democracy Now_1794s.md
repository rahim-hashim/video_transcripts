# How to End the War in Ukraine: Matt Duss and Ray McGovern Debate U.S. Policy on Russia, NATO & More
**Democracy Now!:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Ya4QXB_7c)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!
*  co-host Juan González in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
*  Well, we begin today's show looking at the war in Ukraine.
*  Russia has announced it's rejoining a deal allowing for grain shipments from Ukraine's
*  ports.
*  This comes just four days after Russia withdrew from the deal, sparking fears it could worsen
*  the global hunger crisis.
*  The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the renewed deal would prioritize grain
*  shipments to Somalia, Djibouti, Sudan and other African nations.
*  Russia said it rejoined the deal after Ukraine agreed not to use the sea corridor to attack
*  Russian forces.
*  Meanwhile, The New York Times is reporting senior Russian military leaders have had high-level
*  about how tactical weapons could be used in the war in Ukraine.
*  That's tactical nuclear weapons.
*  The article was based on unnamed U.S. officials who said they have seen no evidence that the
*  Russians were moving nuclear weapons into place or making preparations for a nuclear
*  strike.
*  Last month, President Biden described the war in Ukraine as the first time the world
*  has seen a direct threat of the use of a nuclear weapon since the Cuban Missile Crisis 60 years
*  ago.
*  In a speech to Democratic donors, Biden said, quote,
*  We're trying to figure out what is Putin's off-ramp.
*  Well, today we host a debate on the U.S. response to Russia's invasion and U.S. policy toward
*  Russia.
*  We're joined by two guests.
*  In Washington, D.C., we're joined by Matt Duss.
*  He's former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders, a Ukrainian-American who's
*  a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
*  And in Raleigh, North Carolina, we're joined by Ray McGovern, former senior CIA analyst.
*  His 27-year career as a CIA analyst includes serving as chief of Soviet Foreign Policy
*  Branch and daily briefer of the president's daily brief.
*  At the time, it was George H.W. Bush.
*  He's co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.
*  Welcome you both to Democracy Now!, Ray McGovern.
*  Let's begin with you.
*  Why don't you lay out what you think the U.S. policy should be toward Russia now in
*  dealing with the Ukraine war?
*  Amy, I think we need to go back and figure out how this all started in order to figure
*  out how to end it.
*  In a word, you quoted the New York Times story this morning about Russian tactical nuclear
*  missiles and senior Russian military officials discussing this.
*  The source described by the New York Times was multiple U.S. officials.
*  Now, I dare say that the same multiple U.S. officials and some of the same authors of
*  this piece that warned us seven times at the end of July in one article that there were
*  sure to be weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
*  I guess we have to say that the New York Times has lost its credibility on these issues,
*  the more so since they back off the story themselves saying Putin himself last week
*  said there's no need for us to use tactical nuclear missiles and we never threaten to
*  do so.
*  And Putin happens to be right on that.
*  Last thing I'll say here is that the notion that the Russians are desperate is erroneous.
*  It's contrived.
*  The Russians aren't losing.
*  The Russians are not going to lose because they can't afford to.
*  And when I say this, I mean that Putin sees an existential threat from not only Ukraine
*  becoming part of NATO, but NATO using the emplacements for so-called anti-ballistic
*  missiles in Romania and Poland already there to put in cruise missiles or to put in hypersonic
*  missiles, which Putin himself warned last December would give him between seven and
*  ten minutes or, if hypersonic missiles, five minutes to decide, in a word, whether to blow
*  up the rest of the world.
*  Now, Katrina Vanden Heuvel said in an op-ed just last week, you know, we have to empathize
*  with anyone, even the hated Putin, even the hated Russians.
*  And you know, just thinking this through, and I'll close with this, thinking about
*  how many Americans hate Russia.
*  I mean, hate is the word.
*  And I think back to South Pacific, you know, you've got to be carefully taught.
*  You've got to be taught to hate and fear.
*  You've got to be taught, oh dear, to hear.
*  It's got to be drummed in your dear little ear.
*  You've got to be carefully taught.
*  You've got to be taught the Russians to hate.
*  In order to remain part of the Fourth Estate, you've got to—I made up the last two lines,
*  okay?
*  But that's what it is.
*  In a word, we've had six years of unfounded hating Russians.
*  I mentioned Russiagate.
*  I think the press, the Fourth Estate, could do a real service by saying, hey, we were
*  wrong about that.
*  The Russians didn't hack into the DNC, and they didn't do all those other dastardly
*  things that they were accused of.
*  Let those 35 Russian diplomats come on back in.
*  Let's talk to each other.
*  Let's work this out.
*  There's no reason why we can't make a deal.
*  I'd like to bring in Matt Doss on this issue.
*  Matt, as a foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, famously an advocate for peace, not
*  war, what is your perspective on the—how this war can end?
*  And also the issue of how it began.
*  Right.
*  I mean, well, thank you for having me, first of all.
*  I would say the easiest way for this war to end would be for Vladimir Putin to end his
*  invasion and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.
*  You know, as far as how this war began, I mean, there's certainly a lot of things
*  we could bring in to describe, you know, the deteriorating U.S.-Russia relationship over
*  the past decades and longer.
*  But just to focus on this issue of NATO, which was brought up just earlier, you know, certainly
*  Vladimir Putin has brought up the concern about NATO.
*  This is not something just he has brought up.
*  Other Russian officials have brought it up in the past.
*  I think it's fair to say that some of the steps that were taken with regard to NATO
*  could have been done differently.
*  But this idea that Vladimir Putin had to wage this war because he sees an existential threat
*  from NATO I think has just been completely discredited by events.
*  Let's remember, Finland and Sweden announced their decision to join NATO some months ago.
*  Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia.
*  The response from the Russian government was basically, you know, no big deal.
*  I would suggest that if NATO was really contributing to the sense of existential threat here, we
*  might have seen a bit of a different response to Finland joining NATO.
*  And I'd like to ask you, Matt, in terms of that, though, clearly there is a far different
*  relationship between Ukraine and Russia than there is between Finland and Russia.
*  Clearly, Russia historically sees Ukraine as the entry point to previous invasions and
*  attacks on its country, whether it's Napoleon in the 19th century or Hitler and the Nazis
*  in the 20th century.
*  Your sense of Putin's view of the special relationship that has existed between Ukraine
*  and Russia?
*  No, I think that's very fair to bring up.
*  Clearly, there's a very different historical relationship between Russia and Ukraine.
*  You know, and Putin himself has described his view of that relationship, which is that
*  Ukrainians don't really exist.
*  They are simply Russians.
*  Certainly, Ukrainians disagree with that, and I think most of the people in the world
*  would disagree with that.
*  Ukraine is a different country.
*  Ukraine has a different culture, a different history.
*  Certainly there is a historical relationship with Russia.
*  But I think this also gets to what one of Putin's real goals here is, and that is
*  not just to defend himself against the alleged threat from NATO encroachment, but it is
*  to erase the Ukrainians as an independent political entity.
*  And I think we see various steps that he is taking to make that vision real, including
*  the kidnapping, essentially, of thousands of Ukrainian children, you know, transporting
*  them into Russia, putting them with new families, a violation, a gross violation of international
*  humanitarian law with regard to occupied territories.
*  So I think there's—you know, Putin himself has given us, I think, a much better understanding
*  of his real goals and grievances in launching this war.
*  I wanted to go to General Mike Mullen.
*  In October, the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared on ABC this week
*  calling for talks to end the war.
*  It also speaks to the need, I think, to get to the table.
*  I'm a little concerned about the language, which we're about at the top, if you will.
*  President Biden's language.
*  President Biden's language, we're about at the top of the language scale, if you will.
*  So, and I think we need to back off that a little bit and do everything we possibly can
*  to try to get to the table to resolve this thing.
*  I wanted to get both of your responses on this, beginning with Matt Duss.
*  You're the former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders.
*  Clearly, there is a major debate going on right now within the progressive community
*  of elected officials in Congress.
*  You had this letter that was released and withdrawn within a day that called for continued
*  military support for Ukraine, but at the same time pushing for negotiations, as we've
*  seen Germany call for and France call for.
*  That was released, but withdrawn by Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive
*  Caucus.
*  We interviewed Congressman Rokana.
*  He said it shouldn't have been withdrawn.
*  It should be the position.
*  If you can explain why they would have withdrawn this—and you have Bernie Sanders himself.
*  He's not a congressman, so he wouldn't have signed on to the letter.
*  He's a senator.
*  But he did say that he supported the withdrawal of the letter.
*  He said the Russian invasion of Ukraine has to be resisted, that the letter should have
*  been withdrawn.
*  He said, I don't agree with that.
*  They don't agree with it, apparently, around the issue of urging President Biden to negotiate
*  an end to the war with Vladimir Putin.
*  Explain what this battle is about.
*  And then I'd like to get Ray McGovern's response as well.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, a couple things about the letter.
*  One is, I think, in general terms, it is right to support diplomacy.
*  I mean, as I've said, I said in a recent interview with The New Yorker, you know, the
*  United States is bringing its superior military and intelligence capabilities to bear on Ukraine's
*  behalf, I think, appropriately.
*  It is also appropriate for the United States to bring its superior diplomatic capabilities
*  to bear on Ukraine's behalf.
*  But I think the question here is when the time is right for that high-level diplomacy.
*  I think no one wants to see the United States, or I would say I don't want to see—and
*  certainly many Americans and Ukrainians don't want to see the United States simply negotiating
*  the end to this war with Russia over the heads of Ukrainians.
*  It is their country that has been invaded.
*  They're the ones who are fighting and dying to defend their country.
*  So I think this—you know, we want to avoid the impression that this is simply two great
*  powers, you know, divvying up the spoils.
*  So I think that is part of the concern that you saw from even some of the signers of the
*  letter, which I would just remind folks was actually written in, I believe, June and July
*  and signed in June and July and then released with a little warning to some of the signers.
*  So I don't want to get too into the details of that.
*  But I would agree that, you know, diplomacy is good.
*  I think everyone understands that at some point there will need to be a negotiation
*  to bring this war to a close, but I think the tension within the progressive community
*  comes to when and how that diplomacy actually takes place.
*  Ray McGovern?
*  Well, Amy, I was distraught.
*  It was scandalous that within 36 hours those progressive Democrats tuck tail and gave up.
*  I mean, the suggestion was eminently sensible.
*  Who could be against talks?
*  You know, there's an opportunity coming up where presidents are to meet in Bali, Indonesia.
*  There would be an opportunity.
*  Rose Gottemoeller, who used to be Obama's czar in the State Department for Arms Control,
*  has suggested that we start with these intermediate-range nuclear missiles and start to deal on a tactical
*  level.
*  But the notion that we shouldn't talk is, you know, I've just been focusing on the
*  Cuban Missile Crisis of exactly 60 years ago.
*  How did that get resolved?
*  By talks and by a modicum of trust.
*  Let me explain.
*  Kennedy took a very, very serious position, didn't he?
*  He said, look, here's a quarantine.
*  He called it a quarantine.
*  It was really a blockade, illegal.
*  Here's my invasion force in Key West, and here I'm going to threaten nuclear weapons.
*  That's what he did.
*  Khrushchev talked to him and said, well, look, okay, we didn't—we're going to back off,
*  but we need something.
*  And Kennedy said, okay, I promise not to—I promise not to invade Cuba.
*  And Khrushchev said, okay.
*  And on the side, they did this little deal on Turkey.
*  Now, that was because these were oral promises.
*  These were negotiations by teletype in those days.
*  But why we can't have that kind of thing now, with people say you're giving in to
*  the Russians, is beyond me.
*  With respect to the Finnish—let me just say a word about that.
*  Matt only quoted the first part of Russia's response to the Finnish application to join
*  NATO.
*  What Putin said is, look, we've lived with the Finns for a lot of years.
*  As long as no NATO infrastructure goes into Finland, we got no problem.
*  What does that mean?
*  NATO infrastructure are these little holes in the ground that can accommodate missiles
*  like the Tomahawk and hypersonic missiles, which can reach Moscow in five, six, seven
*  minutes.
*  That's what they're afraid of, and that's what they consider to be their existential
*  threat.
*  Final word here, comparing the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Ukraine crisis.
*  Now, did anyone say—I'm sorry.
*  Anybody say to John Kennedy, look, Mr. President, you're overreacting.
*  This is unprovoked, all these measures.
*  You're taking some of them illegal, blockade, all that.
*  That's unprovoked.
*  Did anybody say that?
*  No.
*  Why?
*  Because it was provoked.
*  Now, putting missiles within five minutes, six minutes of Moscow or the ICBM force in
*  the western part of Russia, that's provocation, folks.
*  And Putin has been warning about that for seven, eight, nine years.
*  John Mearsheimer, the dean of the realistic school of political science, said eight years
*  ago that the crisis in Ukraine is the West's fault.
*  He had used good evidence for that.
*  There's lots more evidence now.
*  He was right then, and he's right now.
*  So what does that mean?
*  That means we have to deal.
*  We have to deal with the fact that Putin is in the same position that John Kennedy was
*  60 years ago.
*  He sees it as an existential threat.
*  He's not going to back off.
*  He's going to do illegal things.
*  Unless we understand that and unless our administration gets used to the fact that—I was a military
*  intelligence officer, OK?
*  If you look at the map, for God's sake, where's the enemy?
*  What's the terrain?
*  What's the weather?
*  What's the weather going to be in the next couple of months?
*  And most of all, what we call locks, not bagels and locks, but lines of communication and
*  supply.
*  I mean, Russia can't lose this, either militarily or politically.
*  It's going to keep going as far as it has to.
*  If high Mars and the like comes in, it's going to have to go farther north and west,
*  as Lavrov, the Russian pharmacist, has said.
*  It's a matter of geography.
*  We would settle for the Donbass and southern Ukraine.
*  If you're going to put in high Mars or worse, geography will dictate that we go farther.
*  So talks, of course, talks are necessary.
*  Talks are really labial, is the German word.
*  They're very delicate because there's very little trust.
*  There has to be a modicum of trust, as there was in 1962 on the Cuba Missile Crisis.
*  I'd like to ask Matt and possibly Ray also to respond to the—Europe is suffering much
*  result of the continuation of this war, both in terms of its having to redirect its energy
*  sources, much higher inflation than exists here in the United States right now.
*  And there are some of you that Europe was dragged into this, more by the United States
*  in terms of the way it approached Russia and Putin in terms of Ukraine.
*  Is there a response to that and how the—and to whether there are differences between how
*  Europe sees this war and the United States?
*  I mean, I think there initially were.
*  I mean, I think we saw the reports that European leaders were actually quite skeptical, as
*  publicly were Ukrainian leaders, of the prospect of a Russian invasion.
*  The United States continued to say that the intelligence showed that Russia was preparing
*  for an invasion, that the pieces were being moved into place for this invasion, and they
*  turned out to be right.
*  You know, I mean, Mr. McGovern earlier brought up the Iraq War WMD's debacle, and I think
*  certainly the Biden administration is quite aware of that record.
*  And I think they have been very, very careful in the importance of rebuilding U.S. credibility
*  when it comes to making these kinds of claims.
*  And I think to their credit, the claims, you know, the intelligence that they have made
*  public all along the way has been affirmed repeatedly.
*  Now, with regard to the European position, I think there were a lot of European countries,
*  particularly Germany, that had a vision of much cooperation with Vladimir Putin, certainly
*  on the issue of energy.
*  But I think European leaders, based on observing Putin's own behavior, have come around to
*  the U.S. view of the threat that Putin poses and what the problem, what this invasion of
*  Ukraine could really mean, not just for Europe, but for the world.
*  Certainly they are the ones who are facing much more immediate difficulty with regard
*  to energy and food insecurity.
*  The Global South, as Amy mentioned early on, with regard to the agreement over grain export,
*  this is a really good deal that's happening, because certainly countries in the Global
*  South are bearing the brunt of this global food crisis as well.
*  But just one last point here, with, you know, Mr. McGovern brought up John Mearsheimer's
*  comment about this war being the U.S.'s fault.
*  You know, I know John Mearsheimer.
*  He is not, however, the pope.
*  He has a view.
*  I think there are many eminent scholars who know Russia much better than John Mearsheimer
*  who have a very different view of how we got here.
*  So again, I think those views should be taken into account, and I would point people once
*  again to what Vladimir Putin himself has said is the reason for this invasion, repeatedly,
*  both in the written word and in speeches.
*  And that, in part, is to reestablish what he believes to be Russia's historical rights,
*  control of what he believes to be a kind of Russian imperium.
*  So that's not to say that diplomacy isn't necessary.
*  Diplomacy is necessary.
*  I believe there is diplomacy ongoing right now, perhaps not at the high level that some
*  would like to see.
*  But we know that, you know, the U.S. Defense Secretary Austin has a line open with Russian
*  Defense Minister Shoigu.
*  They have talked multiple times.
*  There's also, you know, contacts and talks going on at lower levels.
*  You know, and I think these are the kinds of things that could lead to greater talks
*  at higher levels at some time down the future.
*  But I think the disagreement is when does that time come?
*  When is it most appropriate?
*  Raymond Garvin, if you could respond.
*  And also, this issue of Europe and energy and Russia, the blowing up of the Nord Stream
*  one and two pipelines, which the Western press is remarkably uninterested in trying to investigate
*  what actually happened there.
*  And these ludicrous claims, in my view, that Russia would blow up its own $10 billion project
*  of supplying energy to Europe.
*  There you go, Juan.
*  Most Americans would be prepared to believe that.
*  And I would submit that that's a direct result of six years' worth of brainwashing.
*  OK?
*  Now, with respect to what Putin has said, now, Matt is free to quote Putin, but not
*  erroneously.
*  Putin spelled out very precisely what the aims of that invasion was.
*  He said it was a demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.
*  There was no indication that he sent enough troops in there to take over Kiev.
*  As a matter of fact, they've been very reluctant to shell the cities until now, until many
*  provocations have happened.
*  So you have to kind of really not do what I call the Giuliani theorem.
*  You recall what he said to that Arizona legislator about corruption in the election.
*  He's on a phone.
*  He says, there's lots of corruption.
*  Well, you've got to look at it, because it's corrupt.
*  And the legislator said, well, oh, my God, well, sure we'll look at it.
*  What's the evidence?
*  And Giuliani famously said, well, we have lots of theories, but no evidence.
*  Now, I would suggest to Matt that he's got a nice theory there that Putin wants to take
*  over Ukraine and that Putin wants to take over maybe the rest of Europe, like other
*  people say.
*  There's no evidence for that.
*  Now, with respect to the West Germans, the West Europeans, and particularly the Germans,
*  I know the Germans real well.
*  I spent five years there.
*  Some of them are my best friends, all right?
*  They are so subservient to the United States, 77 years after the war, that it's hard for
*  me to believe they won't stand up on their own two feet when—and it's very clear to
*  me—when the U.S. or its allies, UK, blow up Nord Stream 1 and 2.
*  I mean, hello?
*  So German industry is going to go, boom.
*  German people are going to go, poof, okay, this winter.
*  I mean, German people, will they ever—will they ever act any different than they did
*  in 1933 and stand up on their own two legs and say, no, we're not going to abide by
*  that?
*  The Germans had the majority in 1933.
*  There are a majority of German citizens who feel straight away that this is—this is
*  unnecessary.
*  And I dare say they may follow the Czechs and many of the others who, by the tens of
*  thousands already in the streets, I just hope that they see their way to standing on their
*  own two feet and saying, look, you know, we put up with a lot of stuff, and when you blow
*  up those pipelines, we're going to freeze.
*  And also, our industry is going kaput.
*  So would you lay off—we're going to stand on our own two feet, we're going to make
*  a deal with the Russians?
*  Now, there are reports that the Germans were already talking with the Russians about a
*  on energy, on gas supplies, when those pipelines were broken—were sabotaged.
*  So, you know, it's a real sad story in Europe.
*  It's going to be sadder as the months go by.
*  And not only that, but, you know, as the ice covers those fields in Ukraine, Russian forces
*  are going to go forward.
*  And there is a hint in Putin's most—his latest speech that Odessa, okay, Odessa could
*  be negotiated about.
*  People ought to look at that.
*  People ought to read his speeches.
*  People ought to read through the Q&A.
*  Now, if Odessa can easily fall—after all, it's a Russian city—if it can fall to the
*  Russians, well, maybe they'd be able to negotiate on that and say, look, we'll make
*  a deal here.
*  Let's talk and let's work out something where we stop and Ukraine persists in a smaller
*  way, but the war is over and Ukrainians stop dying by the thousands.
*  So let's get Matt Tuss's response to that and also Juan's question about Nord Stream.
*  Newsweek reported, speaking to reporters on February 7th, Biden said, if Russia invades,
*  that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
*  There will no longer be a Nord Stream 2.
*  We will bring an end to it, the president said.
*  A journalist asked Biden how he could do that since Germany was in control of the project.
*  The president replied, I promise you, we will be able to do it.
*  So if you could talk about both Nord Stream and the rest of what Ray McGovern just said.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, just to address Nord Stream first, I think what the president clearly meant there
*  was that Nord Stream 2 would not be brought online.
*  It would not—the project would be halted.
*  I don't think that was a threat, you know, despite the tendency of some to try and interpret
*  as a threat that the United States would blow up Nord Stream 2.
*  And there's no evidence that the United States was responsible for that.
*  As for some of these other claims about what Putin really wants, I feel like we're getting
*  into just bizarre territory here, to claim that Putin wasn't trying to take over Kiev.
*  Listen, the Russians landed strike teams outside Kiev with the goal of toppling the Ukrainian
*  government.
*  These troops were not just there to go camping, OK?
*  I mean, the plan clearly was to land forces inside Kiev to take control of the government.
*  Clearly Russia miscalculated.
*  They did not send enough troops.
*  They did not have solid enough supply lines to support these troops.
*  But then to turn around and point to Russia's poor planning as somehow evidence that Putin's
*  goals were much more modest, I think is just untenable.
*  I did not claim that Putin wants to take over all of Europe.
*  I pointed out that Putin himself claimed that he wanted to reestablish what he describes
*  as Russia's historic right.
*  So I don't want to overstate that.
*  But I do, again, want to point people, think, to things that Putin has written and said
*  which give a good idea of his own goals.
