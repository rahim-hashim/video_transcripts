# “The Heat Will Kill You First”: Rolling Stone’s Jeff Goodell on Life and Death on a Scorched Planet
**Democracy Now!:** [July 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZVqXuBXHk)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  We begin today's show looking at the suffocating heat gripping three continents as the summer's
*  record-breaking temperatures continue to scorch large swaths of the United States, Europe
*  and Asia.
*  China just saw its highest temperature in recorded history, topping 126 degrees Fahrenheit,
*  smashing the previous record by three degrees.
*  In northern Syria, displaced people described the conditions at camps as akin to living
*  in an oven, with children and the elderly facing few options for relief from 108-degree
*  heat.
*  Meanwhile, a third of people in the United States face excessive heat warnings or advisories
*  this weekend, and Europe could record its hottest day ever this week.
*  Italian authorities issued an extreme health risk in 16 cities as extreme heat dominated
*  the world.
*  As you can see, there are lots of tourists here in Italy, and some of them have collapsed
*  in the last few days because of heat strokes, and that includes a British tourist who passed
*  out in front of the Colosseum.
*  In Spain, thermal imaging resembles the sun as ground temperatures reach a blistering
*  140 degrees.
*  This fire is ripped through the Spanish island of La Palma, destroying homes and displacing
*  hundreds.
*  More than a thousand miles away, the heat fans the flames in Croatia as well.
*  Water temperatures off the coast of Florida are hitting some of the highest levels on
*  record, creating a dire situation for the coral reefs.
*  We are in Phoenix, Arizona, talking about the scorching heat.
*  Now, it's not just here in Arizona, but we're outside of Valley Wise Hospital, where they're
*  talking about influx in patients suffering from all kinds of heat-related illnesses.
*  We're talking about heat stroke.
*  We're talking about heat exhaustion, as well as third-degree burns.
*  The heat wave in Arizona is on track to break the previous record of 18 straight days of
*  temperatures surpassing 110 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix.
*  Extreme heat now kills more people in the United States than any other extreme weather.
*  Some of those most at risk include people who work outdoors as well as unhoused people.
*  All this comes as a U.N. climate change report found the Earth could pass a dangerous temperature
*  threshold in the next decade that could make climate disasters so extreme we will not be
*  able to adapt unless urgent action is taken to reduce carbon emissions.
*  For more, we're joined by longtime climate reporter Jeff Goodell, whose new book is just
*  out, titled The Heat Will Kill You First, Life and Death on a Scorched Planet.
*  He says he decided to write it after he walked for 10 blocks in Phoenix on a 115-degree
*  Fahrenheit day and nearly passed out, making him realize he'd radically underestimated
*  the dangers of extreme heat.
*  Jeff Goodell has covered the climate crisis for over 20 years at Rolling Stone magazine.
*  His guest essay in The New York Times is headlined, In Texas, Dead Fish and Red Face Desperation
*  are Signs of Things to Come.
*  Jeff, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Congratulations on your new book.
*  It's so important.
*  You describe heat as a, quote, first-order threat that drives all other impacts of the
*  climate crisis.
*  Explain.
*  Well, you know, we're seeing these extreme heat events right now that you just described
*  in your intro, just drawing everyone's attention.
*  But it's really important to grasp that as we burn fossil fuels and loading the atmosphere
*  with CO2, we are, you know, the temperature, we're rising, raising the temperature of the
*  earth, which is driving all of these other climate impacts that you have described and
*  that we talk about when we talk about climate change, like sea level rise, like drought,
*  like the wildfires that have been burning in Canada.
*  Heat is the primary driver for this climate transformation that we're undergoing right
*  now.
*  It is this invisible force that is changing our world.
*  So talk about your experiences of the heat yourself from Phoenix to Texas.
*  You write in your guest essay in The New York Times, In Texas, dead fish and red face desperation
*  are signs of things to come.
*  You can argue that Texas has done this to itself.
*  The planet is getting hotter because of the burning of fossil fuels.
*  This is a simple truth.
*  As clear as the moon in the night sky, no state has profited more from fossil fuels
*  than Texas.
*  Elaborate on this.
*  And don't speak in soundbites.
*  Give us the whole meal.
*  Happily.
*  Happily.
*  So I moved to Texas four or five years ago.
*  And I had lived in the Northeast.
*  And it was really eye-opening moving here because Texas really is the belly of the beast
*  when it comes to both the energy transformation and the impacts of climate change.
*  This is a state that was built around fossil fuels.
*  There's tremendous riches here as a result of our dependence upon fossil fuels.
*  There's tremendous sort of economic and cultural inertia around oil and gas in this state.
*  And you feel it everywhere you go here.
*  But it's also the state where this transformation towards clean energy is happening very quickly.
*  We had an extreme heat dome in the last couple of weeks here.
*  There was a lot of concern about the grid going down.
*  And the grid was OK.
*  And largely because of 25% of the power that was going on to the grid during this extreme
*  heat wave was from solar power, which performs very well in hot weather and is not only more
*  reliable but cheaper.
*  And so we have these, Texas, even Texas is making this sort of transformation to a cleaner
*  grid.
*  The problem, of course, is it is not happening fast enough.
*  And in Texas, you feel the changing of our climate in a very dramatic way.
*  There's the risks of sea level rise in Houston.
*  There's a $30 billion Ike Dyke that's beginning to be constructed to protect the petrochemical
*  industry and the Houston shipping channel there.
*  There's the heat waves that we've been suffering through in the last few weeks.
*  There's water shortages.
*  As part of my reporting, I was in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the most productive
*  agricultural regions in the country.
*  And the Rio Grande is drawing to a trickle there.
*  And so there's these cascading consequences here where you're feeling the world changing
*  beneath our feet.
*  And yet the kind of politics and culture of this place are lagging far behind those changes.
*  Jeff, we've been talking about this for, well, since it was enacted, but as the deadly
*  heat wave grips Texas where you are, Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill eliminating mandatory
*  water breaks for construction workers.
*  I want to play a clip of Ana Gonzalez, the Texas AFL-CIO Deputy Director of Policy and
*  Politics.
*  Texas is the deadliest state when it comes to construction.
*  One worker dies every three days in our state.
*  In fact, more workers die of heat-related illnesses in our state than any other state.
*  This is the mayor of the Petro Metro—that's Houston—Sylvester Turner, who warned the
*  bill would have devastating consequences for people working outdoors.
*  If House Bill 2127 is allowed to stand and it prevents municipal units of government
*  from saying to employers that under extreme weather conditions like heat, that you can't
*  be mandated to provide water breaks, then can you imagine the number of workers who
*  out there in the heat, construction workers, people working on buildings, developments,
*  you name it, that are going to face heat strokes.
*  Some people will even possibly lose their lives because they're operating, working
*  in very dangerous conditions.
*  This bill is totally insensitive.
*  It goes contrary to the health and well-being and welfare of workers who are out there doing—working
*  under conditions that many, if not most, would dare not work under.
*  I mean, that's the Houston Mayor Turner.
*  Jeff, he was talking about the bill hoping it wouldn't be passed.
*  It has been passed and is going to soon go into effect.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  And Mayor Turner called it insensitive and I would say that's a gross understatement.
*  It's barbaric.
*  I mean, I live here.
*  I see what it's like working outside.
*  I see these workers working, building the buildings that are going up here in Austin.
*  Austin's a boom town and there's construction everywhere.
*  And it's hard for me during these heat waves to walk to my mailbox to check the mail.
*  The idea that you're working on a rooftop or laying asphalt outside in this heat and
*  you're forbidden from taking water and shade breaks, I mean, it's just like back to kind
*  of Sinclair Lewis's The Jungle.
*  I mean, I don't know how to explain this other than to talk about a kind of—there's a kind
*  of racism to this.
*  Many of the workers here that are keeping the state going are Mexican.
*  They are coming across the border.
*  They're working incredibly hard.
*  It's just a kind of politics that's rising here in Texas that I have no kind of good
*  moral explanation for how this can be justified in any way.
*  And in my book, I write about the death of an agricultural worker named Sebastian Perez,
*  not in Texas but in Oregon, who died in the fields because he was afraid that if he took
*  a water break and a shade break, he would lose his job.
*  And so this kind of—this law that the governor—this legislation that the governor has signed is
*  going to directly result in the deaths of many Texans.
*  In your new book, The Heat Will Kill You First, Life and Death on a Scorched Planet, Jeff
*  Goodell, you write about what happens to our bodies as the heat rises above 107 degrees
*  Fahrenheit.
*  You say, as the heat rises, the proteins unfold and the bonds that keep the structures together
*  break.
*  At the most fundamental level, your body unravels.
*  Your insides melt and disintegrate.
*  You're hemorrhaging everywhere.
*  Take it from there, Jeff.
*  Well, that's sort of the end.
*  To begin, you know, our bodies are finely tuned machines that work in a very narrow
*  temperature range.
*  All of us understand that intuitively.
*  If you have a temperature of 100 degrees, you know something's going on in your body.
*  If you have a temperature of 101 or 102, you're calling the doctor.
*  If you have a temperature of 105, you're going to the hospital.
*  We all know this in our lives.
*  We don't understand the risks of that in an outdoor environment and in these kinds of
*  extreme heat events.
*  What happens when your body gets hot is we only have one mechanism to cool down, and
*  that is sweat.
*  As we all know, when it gets hot, our heart starts pumping faster and it's pushing the
*  blood away from our internal organs and away from our brains, which is one of the reasons
*  why you get kind of dizzy or hallucinogenic or lightheaded when you're suffering from
*  extreme heat.
*  As it pushes the blood away from the internal organs through our skin to cool off through
*  sweating, it puts enormous strain on our heart.
*  So a lot of people who are the most vulnerable to heat are people who have heart conditions,
*  circulatory issues, taking medications that are related to that.
*  Your body is in this sort of desperate attempt to dissipate this heat.
*  When you're an outdoor worker, when you are in an environment that your body just can't
*  sweat enough, either because you're not drinking enough water and you lose the ability to sweat,
*  or you just simply can't kind of dump enough heat out of your body to keep your internal
*  body temperature from rising above 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, then the things start happening
*  that you described, which is literally the membranes of your cells begin to melt, the
*  proteins that control the functions of those cellular structures begin to unfold, and your
*  body kind of literally melts from the inside.
*  And it's a horrible way to go.
*  And it's something, you know, most people who die of heat stroke don't get that far.
*  It's usually a heart attack or something like that that is the cause of death.
*  But it's also one reason why heat mortality is dramatically underestimated in our accounting
*  of it, because unlike a knife or a gunshot, there is no kind of heat wound when someone
*  dies from extreme heat.
*  So a lot of people die of heart attacks or other circulatory problems, and they're
*  never diagnosed as heat deaths.
*  And so these sort of mortality numbers that you were citing in the opening and that I
*  cited in my book are widely understood to be grossly underestimated.
*  New York Times, Op-Ed, if there's one thing we should understand about the risks of extreme
*  heat, it's this.
*  All living things, from humans to hummingbirds, share one simple fate.
*  If the temperature they're used to, what scientists sometimes call their Goldilocks
*  Zone, rises too far, too fast, they die.
*  Talk about the Goldilocks Zone and also talk about why you don't like the term global
*  warming, Jeff.
*  The Goldilocks Zone is a phrase that scientists use when they're—who are looking for life
*  on other planets.
*  What they're looking for is planets that are not too cold so that—what they're looking
*  for is liquid water.
*  And if the planets are too cold, the water is ice.
*  If it's too hot, the water is vaporized and it's gone.
*  So they're looking for this sort of medium temperature planets, what they call the Goldilocks
*  Zone.
*  And I use it in my book because all life on our planet has evolved under this relatively
*  stable climate.
*  Just as we are able to maintain our steady temperature in this sort of given climate
*  zone that we've evolved into, so is it true with pine trees and lizards and polar bears
*  and sharks in the ocean.
*  All living things have this sort of thermal range that we can deal with.
*  And one of the profound things that's happening as we heat up our planet is we're moving out
*  of that Goldilocks Zone, not just for us as humans, but for all living creatures.
*  And so that has profound implications in the sort of distribution of life on our planet.
*  It means that people are going to move, animals are going to move, plants are going to move.
*  They need to migrate to cooler places.
*  And if they can't migrate to cooler places, they die.
*  And it's a very simple truth.
*  It's one that has enormous consequences for politics.
*  You talked about in your intro about refugees moving from various countries and the political
*  consequences of that.
*  We're going to see more and more of that.
*  We're going to see more and more changes in disease patterns as animals carrying various
*  microbes move into new places.
*  A simple example of this is mosquitoes that are very sensitive to temperature moving into
*  hotter places, carrying diseases like dengue and Zika and malaria with them.
*  We're seeing this in the drawing out of forests that are causing these bigger and hotter wildfires
*  that are causing the smoke that has inundated the East Coast in recent weeks.
*  This changes in this sort of Goldilocks Zone are profoundly rearranging life on our planet.
*  And that's why heat is such an important force to understand, both in the way that
*  it impacts our body, but also in the way it impacts the sort of dynamics of life on our planet.
*  Have you been shocked by how fast this has happened, and what do you think needs to happen?
*  Yeah.
*  I think anybody who's been watching this covering, talking about climate, journalists like myself
*  and scientists who've been looking at this for a long time, are both shocked by two things.
*  One by how rapid the changes are that we're seeing given the kind of levels of CO2 that
*  we're at, and also by the predictability of it in a certain way.
*  We've known, ExxonMobil has known for a very long time, that as we burn fossil fuels and
*  dump CO2 into the atmosphere, the temperature of the planet is going to rise.
*  And it's broadly, those predictions have been very accurate and held true.
*  We've known for decades.
*  And the fact that we've done essentially nothing to stop that rise is terribly disappointing
*  and predictable and surprising at the same time.
*  And what do we need to do?
*  We need to stop burning fossil fuels, because that is what's driving the temperature change
*  on the planet.
*  And we also have to think differently about the risks that we are running.
*  We have to understand something like heat.
*  I think of my book as a sort of survival guide for the 21st century.
*  We have to understand the risks of extreme heat and these extreme events, what to do,
*  how to handle it, who's vulnerable, who's not, how to better address that, how to democratize
*  air conditioning, how to build cities in a different way that incorporates shade, how
*  to address events like extreme heat for the most vulnerable communities, cooling centers,
*  things like that.
*  We have not at all come close to grasping the scale and scope of the crisis we're
*  facing.
*  And that is not alarmist.
*  That is just kind of the straightforward reality of where we are.
*  And I'm very hopeful.
*  We have 10 seconds.
*  OK, I'm very hopeful that we can use this transformation to build a better and cleaner
*  and more healthy world, but we need to really grasp what we're doing.
*  Jeff Goddard's new book is called The Heat Will Kill You First, Life and Death on a Scorched
*  Planet.
