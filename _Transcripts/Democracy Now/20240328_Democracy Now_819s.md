# I Could Not Stay Silent: Annelle Sheline Resigns from State Dept. over U.S. Gaza Policy
**Democracy Now!:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRI-MtoSD_E)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
*  A State Department official working on human rights issues in the Middle East resigned
*  Wednesday in protest against U.S. support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Anel Shieline worked as a foreign affairs officer in the Bureau of Democracy, Human
*  Rights and Labor for a year before publicly resigning.
*  In an op-ed published in CNN, she wrote, quote, "'For the past year, I worked for the office
*  devoted to promoting human rights in the Middle East.
*  I believe strongly in the mission and in the important work of that office.
*  However, as a representative of a government that is directly enabling what the International
*  Court of Justice has said could plausibly be a genocide in Gaza, such work has become
*  almost impossible.
*  Unable to serve an administration that enables such atrocities, I have decided to resign from
*  my position at the Department of State,' she wrote.
*  Anel Shieline is the most significant protest resignation over U.S. support for Israel's
*  assault on Gaza since the resignation in October of Josh Paul, the senior State Department
*  official involved in arms transfers to foreign governments.
*  Anel Shieline joins us now from Washington, D.C.
*  And now, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Can you tell us further about the decision you made?
*  ANEL SHIELINE
*  Thanks so much for having me and for your coverage of this issue.
*  I hadn't initially planned to resign publicly.
*  I hadn't been at state for very long, and I didn't think it would necessarily matter.
*  But I decided to go public because when I started to tell colleagues that I was planning
*  to resign over Gaza, so many people's response was, please speak out, please speak for us.
*  Many people are not in a position where they feel they could resign or they are trying
*  to do what they can on the inside.
*  There's still a lot of important, crucial work the State Department does.
*  And so I decided I would go ahead and go public.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH
*  Well, you toldâ€”Anel, you told The Washington Post that you tried to raise concerns internally
*  with dissent cables and at staff forums.
*  So what was the result of that?
*  And how are other people within state, as you said, trying to speak out within the State
*  Department to change policy?
*  ANEL SHIELINE
*  Yes, many people are extremely horrified by the U.S. government's position on this horrific
*  conflict and the actions of both the Israeli and the U.S. governments.
*  There is the dissent channel inside the State Department.
*  I co-wrote a cable and signed other cables.
*  There have been forums for State Department employees to speak out.
*  I spoke with supervisors.
*  I was able to speak with a senior official about my resignation.
*  I think at the end of the day, many people inside state know that this is a horrific
*  policy and can't believe that the United States government is engaged in such actions
*  that contravene American values so directly.
*  But the leadership is not listening.
*  AMY GOODMAN
*  I want to go to the State Department spokesperson, Matt Miller, being questioned by a reporter
*  about the internal dissent channel within the State Department and employees raising
*  concerns over the policies.
*  MAHER ZOUWALILI
*  What is the point of the whole channel?
*  I mean, the secretary listens, and we've all reported about various listening sessions
*  between mid-level or like more senior officials with the secretary, more junior officials.
*  If it's not, if it's being heard, but if it's not taken into account in the policy
*  at all, then don't you think it's a little bit pointless?
*  MATT MILLER So I would disagree with that completely.
*  It is taken into account in the policymaking process.
*  The secretary has heard things in those meetings that he takes on board and that he, that
*  influences his thinking and that he brings to bear in making policy decisions.
*  Now, if what you mean is, are we going to execute a complete reversal of the policy
*  that we implemented?
*  Or are we going to implement exactly some of the policies that the people in these meetings
*  have called for?
*  That's not how this process works.
*  That's not how any organization works.
*  I dare say any of the media organizations in this room, if reporters go to their bosses
*  and offer feedback and the bosses say, well, that's a good point, we're going to take
*  that to bear.
*  On the larger policy, this is the decision that we have made.
*  That's how leadership works.
*  You're doing a long rant on something that I didn't suggest, but do you have any examples
*  on any changes?
*  I'm genuinely curious.
*  Yeah, I will say with respect to any number of issues, with respect to the delivery of
*  humanitarian assistance, we have heard good ideas from people inside the building who
*  have come and offered constructive feedback, and we have implemented those.
*  Now, there are people that when you say, like, if the idea is that the United States to cut
*  off support for Israel, that's just a fundamental policy disagreement.
*  So when you see people who offer interviews that say, we want the United States to stop
*  supporting Israel's right to defend itself, that's not something the secretary agrees
*  with, it's not something the president agrees with, and ultimately they are the ones who
*  have the responsibility of making those decisions.
*  So Anel Sheline, if you can respond to the State Department spokesperson, Matt Miller.
*  You know, I think American law is quite clear here in terms of the Leahy laws, for example,
*  that when a foreign military is credibly accused of gross human rights violations, the law
*  is that the U.S. will no longer provide weapons to those units, or 620-I of the Foreign Assistance
*  Act, that a government that is blocking American humanitarian aid is no longer eligible for
*  U.S. military assistance.
*  These laws are not being applied.
*  So I think this is not only having a horrific effect on the people of Gaza, but in terms
*  of America's standing in the rest of the world.
*  This administration came in pledging to reestablish American moral leadership, re-engagement with
*  the international community, uphold the law and the so-called rules-based liberal international
*  order.
*  And I think it's just become clear that this administration is not in fact carrying out
*  any of those pledges.
*  And, you know, my work was on human rights, which is very important work that the State
*  Department does.
*  But I think on this issue in particular, the political calculus has been that U.S. support
*  for Israel is a better political move.
*  But I think what the administration may be starting to see is they may have made the
*  wrong decision on that politically.
*  And, Anil, can you explain whether there's any distinction made?
*  There's a blanket statement about U.S. support for Israel.
*  But is there no distinction within discussions at the State Department between different
*  forms of U.S. support for Israel?
*  So for instance, obviously in this instance, the most important question is that of military
*  aid to Israel at this moment.
*  There, I should be clear that, you know, my area of focus, I was not, Israel and Palestine
*  were not part of my portfolio.
*  I was focusing primarily on North Africa.
*  So I can't speak directly to, you know, some of those conversations.
*  I do think, you know, at the end of the day, the U.S.-Israel relationship is of, is considered
*  of such political importance that decisions regarding it are made at the very top.
*  And so while there are other processes and certainly discussions going on inside state,
*  inside other parts of the government about some of those nuances you were discussing,
*  I don't think we're likely to see any public shift on any of that until those decisions
*  come from the top, that they're ready to reimagine the U.S.-Israel relationship.
*  I wanted to go to another clip of the State Department spokesperson, Matt Miller, saying
*  the Biden administration has not found Israel's actions in Gaza to be a violation of international
*  law.
*  This is some of what he said.
*  We have not found them to be in violation of international humanitarian law, either
*  when it comes to the conduct of the war or when it comes to the provision of humanitarian
*  assistance.
*  That was this week in El Shilin.
*  Either violation of international law or when it comes to providing humanitarian assistance.
*  And yet, President Biden says he is building a port because the Palestinians cannot get
*  enough aid.
*  Exactly.
*  I think that the evidence speaks for itself.
*  We've had, you know, not only the ICJ's ruling, not only the U.N. Security Council
*  ruling.
*  Clearly the administration is unwilling to admit to reality.
*  And again, I just want to reiterate, I think this is not only obviously devastating for
*  the lives of people in Gaza, but is doing incredible damage to America's standing on
*  the international stage.
*  It is incredibly demoralizing for people inside the State Department, many of whom believe
*  very deeply in what America says it stands for.
*  So I'm trying to speak on behalf of those many, many people who feel so betrayed by
*  our government stance.
*  And Anil, could you explain the effect that the massive protests across the United States
*  have had within the State Department, what discussion there was of them, and then of
*  course the uncommitted vote?
*  So, within the State Department, civil servants are very committed to their role of being
*  non-political, of following the instruction that they receive.
*  Within state, people are aware of what's going on outside, but this is not the first
*  time that people have been involved or had to carry out policies they perhaps did not
*  agree with.
*  And it is something that many of these people have signed up for.
*  This is the role of carrying out America's foreign policy.
*  On this issue, I think because it has been so horrific and because we are seeing such
*  growing political pushback from the American public, people are increasingly frustrated.
*  Many other people with whom I spoke said they're considering resigning.
*  But again, it is challenging for someone to, you know, it's not easy to not have a job
*  in this country.
*  I wanted to quote further what you've said in explanation of why you're resigning.
*  You said you're haunted by the final social media post of Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old
*  U.S. Air Force serviceman who self-immolated in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington
*  on February 25.
*  You quote him, many of us like to ask ourselves, what would I do if I was alive during slavery
*  or the Jim Crow South or apartheid?
*  What would I do if my country was committing genocide?
*  The answer is you're doing it right now.
*  If you can explain what that meant to you and how people have responded to you.
*  Sorry.
*  I, you know, that post, I think, spoke to me and many people who had to really look
*  at what they were doing and whetherâ€”you know, for me, I have a young daughter, and
*  I thought about in the future if she were to ask me, you know, what were you doing when
*  this was happening?
*  You were at the State Department.
*  I want to be able to tell her that I didn't stay silent.
*  And I know many people who are deeply affected by those words that Aaron Bushnell posted.
*  And I do think people are trying to do what they can.
*  There is still very important work being done inside the State Department.
*  But I do think until our top levels of leadership are ready to make a change, there's very
*  little that the rank and file are able to do.
*  AMY GOODMAN, The New York Times, April 20, 2012
*  Anel Shieline, we want to thank you so much for being with us.
*  Anel has just resigned from the State Department in protest of U.S. support for Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  She worked as Foreign Affairs Officer in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.
*  She's also the first State Department official to publicly resign since Josh Paul did months ago.
