Who are the minds behind DOGE, and what do they really believe? Historian Quinn Slobodian says three strains of conservatism have converged to form the second Trump administration's anti-democratic coalition: finance-backed corporate interests previously friendly to the Democratic Party, Christian conservative think tanks who have long advocated for the end of the administrative state, and the online-driven movement of reactionary extremists who traffic in white supremacist and neo-Nazi rhetoric. Meanwhile, says Slobodian, "Trump is a person who doesn't believe in much, but he believes in money," leaving him willing to enact the political visions of these three pro-capitalist projects. Slobodian, an expert in German history, also discusses the connections between the Trump sphere and Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, supported by Musk and Vice President JD Vance.

# "Crack-Up Capitalism": Historian Quinn Slobodian on Trump, Musk & Movement to "Shatter" the State
**Democracy Now:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=2.64s)]
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=7.8s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=11.6s)]
*  We look further now at the purge of the federal government underway by Doge, led by tech billionaire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  As protests mount, the two, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, appeared on Fox News Together to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=22.06s)]
*  defend their cuts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=28.04s)]
*  This is Elon Musk. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=29.52s)]
*  I think what we're seeing here is the sort of thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=30.52s)]
*  to restore democracy and the will of the people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=37.08s)]
*  This comes as President Trump spoke at an investor conference in Miami Wednesday and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=40.84s)]
*  floated the idea of sharing some of the savings he claims Doge is making. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=45.32s)]
*  There's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the Doge savings [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=50.2s)]
*  to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=57.04s)]
*  incredible, Elon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=61.8s)]
*  So many billions of dollars, billions, hundreds of billions. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=64.16s)]
*  For more, we're joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=67.24s)]
*  University, author of Crack Up Capitalism. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=71.52s)]
*  His new piece is Speed Up the Breakdown. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=74.52s)]
*  It's about Musk's push to do that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  We welcome you to Democracy Now! [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=82.48s)]
*  If you can start off by telling us what Elon Musk is doing, this whole question over the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=86.04s)]
*  last two days, what is his role? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Does he run the Department of Government Efficiency that President Trump says, when questioned [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=95.4s)]
*  about it, because court papers came out that indicated he didn't, he just said, well, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  what counts is he's a patriot? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=107.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I might have something to say about the patriot question later, but I think [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=109.04s)]
*  that first, I think it's helpful to kind of dispel some of the fog of war and the sort [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=114.92s)]
*  of chaotic and artistic impressions that we're getting out of Washington these days with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=119.72s)]
*  a sense of what the actual lineages are of the political projects we're seeing unfolding [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=124.96s)]
*  here, because I think, and what I wrote about in the piece is I think there's basically [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=130.68s)]
*  three somewhat distinct political projects underway here that haven't really had the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=134.48s)]
*  chance to weave together and have the space close to power the way that they have now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=138.96s)]
*  in the past. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=143.68s)]
*  The first one is the idea that the government should be run like a corporation, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  There's kind of a core Clintonite notion here that we should treat citizens like consumers, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=150.56s)]
*  we should expose bureaucracy to the same kind of competitive pressures and kind of hallmarking [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  and benchmarking that private companies are, and then you have to go in and sort of act [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  like an asset-stripping private equity firm and then peel out all the waste and abuse [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=167.28s)]
*  and put back in sort of more efficient processes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=172.92s)]
*  That's how Musk sold Doge to the American people in late 2024, and that's actually why [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=175.96s)]
*  even some Democrats were on board with the Doge caucus already at the end of December [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=183.0s)]
*  still. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=188.64s)]
*  So, there's something kind of normal about that, and there's a reason why Musk has been [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=189.64s)]
*  posting pictures of Clinton and Gore saying, hey, I'm just doing that sort of business [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=193.0s)]
*  here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=196.68s)]
*  But obviously, things have gone to another level. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=197.68s)]
*  The second, I think, strain of politics that's plugged in here is closer to that of Russell [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=200.68s)]
*  Vought at the Office of the Management of Budget, one of the people who was critical [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=205.88s)]
*  to the Project 2025 document. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=210.84s)]
*  And that is a more often Christian conservative sort of think tank vision of deconstructing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  the administrative state, not to make it more efficient and to cost cut to get to more efficiency [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  and sort of productivity, but because you think certain things that the government has [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=225.4s)]
*  been doing are fundamentally illegitimate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=229.66s)]
*  So there should be no kind of redistributive role for the government. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  There should be no role covering things like the protection of the environment or the provision [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=236.18s)]
*  of special education or the provision of sort of projects towards gender equity, anti-racism [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=240.86s)]
*  and things of that nature. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=247.02s)]
*  So the idea there is you permanently sort of hobble the Leviathan of the state and hack [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  back some of its capacity, send that back to the states and produce a government that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=254.1s)]
*  governs intensively, but not extensively. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=259.38s)]
*  So, you know, border, military budget, maybe federal abortion bans, but all the other sort [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=262.06s)]
*  of post-civil rights, great society programs get sort of permanently euthanized. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  The third strain, though, that sort of gets to some of the more extreme dynamics that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=273.58s)]
*  people have been picking up on is what I think you can call right-wing accelerationism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=278.34s)]
*  So this is a kind of very online ideology, often associated with people like Curtis [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  Jarvin and Nick Land. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=288.06s)]
*  And there the idea is that you don't just sort of trim the state or kind of streamline [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  it, but you shatter it altogether. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=295.02s)]
*  And so there's a vision of total decentralization of sovereignty back to smaller kind of fortified [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=297.14s)]
*  private enclaves, turning the United States into a kind of a patchwork of fiefdoms or [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=303.26s)]
*  Sov Corps, as Jarvin calls them, where people are sort of, you know, opting in, paying to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=309.78s)]
*  get into gated communities and then sort of in zero-sum social Darwinist competition [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=314.9s)]
*  with the world beyond them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=319.94s)]
*  And that's quite sci-fi and kind of speculative. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=321.73999999999995s)]
*  But at times, I think that the sort of sense of panic that we feel is people wondering [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=325.82s)]
*  whether you can just delete all of the kind of capacities of the state and expect to be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  able to plug them back in at any level afterwards, or if there is a kind of irreversible process [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=335.82s)]
*  of dismantlement happening here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  And so, Professor Slobodin, we'll get to Curtis Jarvin in a minute, whom you mentioned. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  But if you could elaborate on some of the ideological precursors to these three strains [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  you identify. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=355.3s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned in the second, for example, deconstructing the administrative state. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=356.3s)]
*  We heard that first from Steve Bannon. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=361.06s)]
*  So if you could, you know, elaborate on where these strains are coming from within the American [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=363.9s)]
*  political tradition, most recently, you know, the last Trump administration, but also prior [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  to that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, many of these things that we think of as kind of natural parts of the way [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=376.85999999999996s)]
*  the U.S. government operates, for example, something like income tax, are actually just [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=382.62s)]
*  over 100 years old. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=387.24s)]
*  So the idea of having a federal government that oversees many parts of social life is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  actually, you know, it's only a few generations in the past. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=395.34s)]
*  And there are conservatives who see that as a kind of a project of decline. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=399.3s)]
*  So famous examples would be someone like James Burnham, who wrote about what he called a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=403.7s)]
*  managerial revolution. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=408.74s)]
*  So there was this fear that, you know, that the kind of the essence of American enterprise [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=410.38s)]
*  was being strangled because there were just all of these civil servants producing a kind [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=415.24s)]
*  of a sclerotic layer over the economy and then pursuing their own kind of ideological [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=419.88s)]
*  project. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=425.74s)]
*  So Russell Vout at OMB talks about what he calls the woke and weaponized bureaucracy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=426.74s)]
*  He talks about almost complete Marxist takeover of the government. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=432.94s)]
*  So this isn't really that much of a sort of neoliberal economic way of thinking. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=438.02s)]
*  It's this belief that the state is a kind of a battlefield for opposing ideologies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=441.74s)]
*  And that's been, you know, pretty consistent on the American right and is now—and certainly [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=447.06s)]
*  informing Steve Bannon's more cultural and political idea of the kind of wars that need [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=452.46s)]
*  to be fought inside of bureaucracy and indeed outside of it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=457.18s)]
*  And can you talk about that battle right now between Bannon and Elon Musk and who, in fact, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=461.7s)]
*  is winning? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=470.7s)]
*  He's been talking about vowing to get Elon Musk kicked out, just said he's a truly evil [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=471.7s)]
*  guy, a very bad guy, and most recently referred to him as a parasitic illegal immigrant. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=476.94s)]
*  Talk more about these two strains. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=486.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this really flared up, obviously, at the end of last year with the debate about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=487.98s)]
*  immigration with the sort of Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Silicon Valley wing defending temporary visas, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=493.3s)]
*  so-called H-1B visas, for their sector because they need a lot of skilled workers kind of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=501.06s)]
*  in the back office. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=506.02000000000004s)]
*  And then Bannon saying that that was itself unpatriotic and there needed to be American [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=507.74s)]
*  jobs for American native workers policy and a much more complete kind of exclusion of, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=513.38s)]
*  you know, new incoming workers. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=518.66s)]
*  What was interesting is that got extremely heated. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=521.5s)]
*  I mean, as you say, Bannon has been not holding back at all in the way he's been describing [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=523.46s)]
*  Silicon Valley as an apartheid state. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  He's even using categories that are more common on the left, like calling it techno-feudalism [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=532.0200000000001s)]
*  and claiming that, like, the bayonets are out and he's advancing and he's coming [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=537.1400000000001s)]
*  for Musk. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=542.0200000000001s)]
*  But what's symptomatic and interesting there is the way that Trump has sort of kept aloof [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  from the whole conflict, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=547.86s)]
*  I think that he is probably instinctively seeing that you don't actually need to choose [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  a side. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=554.7800000000001s)]
*  Actually, you can accommodate, and you will, I think, and are accommodating both sides [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=555.7800000000001s)]
*  of this apparent schism inside of the big MAGA coalition. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=561.06s)]
*  So there's no reason why the kind of hard-border nativists can't get the kind of sadistic [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=566.1s)]
*  roundups that, you know, we're talking about at the top of the program, can't produce [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=572.18s)]
*  terror in the lives of young people in the way that they are doing so effectively that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=576.26s)]
*  will fulfill the kind of libidinal sadistic desires of a certain sector of the MAGA coalition, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=581.42s)]
*  Even as, you know, more quietly, you keep doing more pragmatic immigration policy to, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=587.54s)]
*  you know, fill out the programmers in the back offices of Silicon Valley. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=593.06s)]
*  I think that more likely than not, we're going to get a mixture of both. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=596.74s)]
*  And as to who gets closest to Trump's ear, I mean, the answer, I think, is in the bank [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=601.14s)]
*  accounts. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=605.62s)]
*  There are 500 billion reasons why Trump is going to listen to Musk more than he's going [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=606.86s)]
*  to listen to Bannon. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=611.8s)]
*  And Trump is a person who doesn't believe in much, but he believes in money. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=614.1s)]
*  And he doesn't trust many people, but he trusts people who are richer than him. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=618.0600000000001s)]
*  And Musk's ability to kind of, you know, stroll through the White House as if he has [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=622.22s)]
*  been elected himself, have his three-year-old sort of like muttering to Trump in the middle [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=627.62s)]
*  of a press conference, I think, it gives us as much evidence as we need of the fact that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=631.82s)]
*  he is being given kind of carte blanche here to act as effectively unelected co-president. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, let's go back to Curtis Yarvin, who you mentioned earlier. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=642.7s)]
*  This is Yarvin speaking on The New York Times podcast, The Interview, last month. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=647.1s)]
*  In this clip, he's asked about his belief that the Civil War and the end of chattel [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=652.6600000000001s)]
*  slavery were bad for the formerly enslaved. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=656.86s)]
*  But are you seriously arguing that the era of slavery was somehow better than the era— [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=660.0600000000001s)]
*  The era of 1865 to 1875 was absolutely—and the war itself wasn't good either. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=667.02s)]
*  But if you look at the living conditions for an African American in the South, they are [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=676.34s)]
*  absolutely a turn to deer between 1865 and 1875. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=681.18s)]
*  They are very, very bad because basically this economic system has been disrupted. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=685.5s)]
*  But abolition was a necessary step to get through that period towards—to make people [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=690.14s)]
*  free. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=695.14s)]
*  I believe I'm arguing this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=696.22s)]
*  Brazil abolished slavery in the 1880s without a civil war. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=697.22s)]
*  So that was Curtis Yarvin, someone who Vice President J.D. Vance frequently invokes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=701.34s)]
*  And back in 2021, Vance, then Ohio candidate for U.S. Senate, he was interviewed by the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=707.9s)]
*  conservative Jack Murphy live podcast. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=714.22s)]
*  Murphy just asked Vance how to root out wokeism from American institutions. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=716.86s)]
*  There's this guy Curtis Yarvin who's written about some of these things. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=722.58s)]
*  So one is to basically accept that this entire thing is going to fall in on itself. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=727.02s)]
*  I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=732.82s)]
*  We need like a de-bathification program, but like a de-wokeification program in the United [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=738.02s)]
*  States. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=743.3s)]
*  So if you could tell us, Professor Slobodin, who is Curtis Yarvin? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=745.1s)]
*  You note in your recent New York Review of Books piece his idea—this is quote—his [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=749.5s)]
*  idea of rage, retire all government employees, looks a lot like that of Doge. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=754.82s)]
*  So who is this guy? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  Where did he emerge from? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=762.9000000000001s)]
*  And how did he become so influential? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=764.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was someone who moved to the Bay Area and became a computer programmer, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=766.7800000000001s)]
*  also kind of an amateur poet, and I guess most importantly a pretty widely read blogger [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=774.46s)]
*  in the 2000s, especially the late 2000s, under the name Mencius Moldbug. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=779.82s)]
*  And he became someone who was kind of giving voice to a nascent kind of what was called [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=785.5s)]
*  neo-reactionary or dark enlightenment sentiment in Silicon Valley, which I think combines [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=791.02s)]
*  as the way I've been describing it, a kind of belief in economistic bottom line thinking [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  and productivity. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=802.62s)]
*  But then also an idea that what we need to get back to is a proper sense of hierarchy [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=804.16s)]
*  in this country and in the world. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=809.86s)]
*  So one of the problems of the administrative state is that it has been pursuing equality, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=812.16s)]
*  and it's been working under the false assumption that all humans are somehow equal, that in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=818.18s)]
*  fact there are kind of hierarchies of intelligence, best measured in IQ, which people like Yarvin [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=823.12s)]
*  and increasingly Vance and Trump are seemingly quite obsessed with. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  It can be measured in things like race, group differences in IQ are commonly assumed to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=833.38s)]
*  be real empirical facts in the world of the sort of Silicon Valley right, and perhaps [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=839.46s)]
*  most importantly into hierarchies of gender. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=845.26s)]
*  So the masculinity component in all of this is kind of impossible to overstate. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=849.76s)]
*  There is a reason why the sort of apparent scrambling of gender in gender, queer and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=854.76s)]
*  trans movements is so triggering and so terrifying to people in this world. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=861.28s)]
*  Elon Musk has described the woke mind virus as having killed his child, even though his [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=867.08s)]
*  child is very much alive. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=873.62s)]
*  So the project I think is really about how through the mechanisms of the market and the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=876.38s)]
*  dismantlement of the sort of post New Deal state, the post great society and civil rights [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=881.84s)]
*  we can get back to what they see is a more natural world where men are in charge, white [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=887.9s)]
*  people are in charge, and there is a kind of restoration of the natural order of things. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=894.06s)]
*  And that sort of wishy washy treatment of things like slavery is sort of a provocative [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=901.06s)]
*  way of reopening those questions. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=907.8199999999999s)]
*  And Professor Silvodean, this is about both JD Vance and Elon Musk, the question of their [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  stance on the far-right German party AFD. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=914.94s)]
*  On Friday, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference where [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=918.62s)]
*  he repeatedly attacked Europe on a number of issues. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=922.94s)]
*  And he, while in Germany, held a 30-minute meeting Friday with the head of Germany's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=926.86s)]
*  far-right AFD party, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, rebuking Vance for meeting with the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=933.34s)]
*  AFD ahead of Germany's election. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=938.7800000000001s)]
*  And of course, you have Elon Musk repeatedly using his social media platform X to support [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=942.3000000000001s)]
*  what many call the neo-Nazi party or the Nazi-curious party, for those who are more generous. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=949.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the AFD in Germany is actually a really good example of one of these sort [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=956.62s)]
*  of strange-bad-fellow type parties that I actually think is sort of unhelpfully described [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=962.88s)]
*  as either neo-Nazi or Nazi-curious. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=967.7s)]
*  What it actually is, is it was founded by ordo-liberal economics professors who disliked [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=970.66s)]
*  the way Merkel was handling the eurozone crisis and thought you needed more monetary discipline [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=976.8199999999999s)]
*  and more fiscal discipline. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=981.66s)]
*  They then created an alliance with basically ethno-nationalists, traditionalist members [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=983.28s)]
*  of the so-called New Right, who felt that modernity had produced a fallen world and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=987.98s)]
*  we needed to get back to more rooted links to the land and that certain populations belonged [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=992.68s)]
*  in some spaces and not others. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=998.48s)]
*  And now they have created this kind of—this far-right, neoliberal party that Alice Weidel [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1001.5600000000001s)]
*  sort of gives voice to when she says that, you know, we are actually a libertarian conservative [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1007.4s)]
*  party, as she said in her spaces chat with Musk. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1012.28s)]
*  The AFD is one of only many far-right parties that now Musk is aggressively platforming. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1017.76s)]
*  In the last few days, he's promoted Viktor Orban, Giorgio Maloney, the AFD, and in the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1023.48s)]
*  past has gone as far as promoting Tommy Robinson, the sort of far-right figure from the U.K. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1030.68s)]
*  He has adopted not just sort of a tame language of democracy, as Vance tends to be using, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1036.74s)]
*  but a language, as he used in the rally that he zoomed into, of Germany for the Germans [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  multiculturalism must not be allowed to dilute the German people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1049.72s)]
*  So these are now proper tropes of the far-right as such, and indeed tropes of the Great Replacement [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  Theory, which suggests that liberals have used welfare policy and refugee policy to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  buy voters, which can then swamp and dilute the native population. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1069.04s)]
*  This has now become a common talking point. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1073.8s)]
*  The thing that I think is interesting and important, and perhaps a sign of rare optimism [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1076.14s)]
*  these days, is that Germans actually don't like Elon Musk interfering in their politics. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1081.0600000000002s)]
*  Polls have showed that of non-AFD voters, well over three-quarters thinks he has no [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1086.8200000000002s)]
*  right to butt in. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1092.0s)]
*  And even among AFD voters, only about half actually wants him to be involved. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1093.66s)]
*  So I think what we're seeing already is a bit of a backlash against his attempt to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1098.42s)]
*  kind of play kingmaker in countries, another country that is not his own. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1102.82s)]
*  The left party in Germany has had a surge in recent weeks. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1107.8999999999999s)]
*  They have more people entering the party now than they have since 2009. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1112.86s)]
*  That's partially on the back of like a really full-throated anti-fascist call for the defense [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1117.7s)]
*  of democratic principles by the young leaders, the young female leaders of that party. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1123.22s)]
*  So I think there is a chance here of his belief that he can just, you know, play puppet [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1128.94s)]
*  master globally, actually having a boomerang effect and backlash on his own attempts at [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1134.5800000000002s)]
*  manipulation. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIPWekMahXc&t=1140.22s)]
