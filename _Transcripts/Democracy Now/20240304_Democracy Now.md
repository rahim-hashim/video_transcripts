# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 4, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqyGL_LWXKI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Health officials in Gaza say at least 16 children have died in recent days from starvation and
*  dehydration, as Israel's assault on Gaza continues.
*  UNICEF is warning the number of child deaths will likely, quote, rapidly increase unless
*  the war ends.
*  Pediatricians in Gaza say they have nothing to give malnourished children.
*  Yes, malnutrition plays a major role in the number of children that come to us, and thus
*  in the number of deaths there are.
*  When a child is supposed to eat three meals a day and ends up eating one meal, that's
*  not enough for him.
*  Your body becomes deficient in carbohydrates, vitamins, proteins, and deficient in fats
*  that are necessary for the body.
*  Then the body goes into a severe dehydration state.
*  I can honestly say that we can't even deal properly with 50, 60 percent of the cases
*  we receive, because we have nothing to give them.
*  The most we can do for them is either give them saline solution or sugar solution.
*  On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  She made the comments in a speech in Selma, Alabama, marking the 59th anniversary of Bloody
*  Sunday.
*  And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire
*  for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.
*  The U.S. Vice President's remarks came three days after the United States blocked a U.N.
*  Security Council statement condemning Israel after Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinians
*  seeking aid in Gaza City in a massacre that left 112 people dead and over 700 injured.
*  On Sunday, officials in Gaza accused Israeli forces of killing and wounding dozens more
*  aid seekers who gathered at the Kuwaiti Roundabout in Gaza City.
*  Facing growing international criticism, President Biden on Friday announced the U.S. would begin
*  air dropping food into Gaza.
*  While reading from an index card, Biden twice mistakenly referred to Ukraine instead of
*  Gaza.
*  In the coming days, we're going to join with our friends in Jordan and others on Friday
*  in the air drops of additional food and supplies into Ukraine and seek to continue to open
*  up other avenues in Ukraine, including the possibility of a Marine Corridor, deliver
*  large amounts of humanitarian assistance.
*  On Saturday, the U.S. Air Force and Royal Jordanian Air Force dropped 38,000 ready-to-eat
*  meals into Gaza, enough for one meal for about 1.6 percent of Gaza's population.
*  Humanitarian groups say far more aid is needed in Gaza, where a quarter of the population
*  is on the verge of famine.
*  Major protests against Israel's assault on Gaza were held Saturday in a worldwide
*  day of action.
*  In San Francisco, police fired pepper spray and hit protesters with batons as a march
*  passed the Israeli consulate.
*  Thousands also marched in New York, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Albuquerque, Charlotte and
*  other cities.
*  Protesters in Washington, D.C., included longtime peace activist Kathy Boylan with the Dorothy
*  Day Catholic Worker.
*  She called on Biden to stop arming Israel.
*  We're dropping some food and we're dropping the bombs and the tanks and the bullets and
*  everything else at the same time.
*  That's what he's got to do, stop sending the money and the weapons.
*  Negotiations for a temporary ceasefire faced another setback Sunday, when Israel boycotted
*  talks in Cairo, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of not agreeing
*  to provide a list of all living Israeli hostages.
*  On Saturday, thousands of Israelis marched in Tel Aviv against Netanyahu.
*  Israel is being controlled by a coalition of semi-dictatorial, fascist people who don't
*  have the good of the people in their hearts.
*  We're being misled and led into this endless war that doesn't have an end in sight.
*  Our government doesn't care about the more than 100 hostages that are held in Gaza right
*  now.
*  Our government doesn't care about the people of Israel.
*  They only care about their own interests.
*  They're all criminals.
*  They're crooks.
*  They need to go out.
*  On Sunday, Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz arrived in the United States in what's
*  being described as an unauthorized trip.
*  Gantz, who is seen as a rival to Netanyahu, is scheduled to hold talks with Vice President
*  Kamala Harris and other top officials.
*  Netanyahu has reportedly lashed out at Gantz for making the trip without his approval.
*  The Israeli embassy in Washington has been instructed not to facilitate Gantz's trip.
*  In more news from the region, Israel repeatedly attacked southern Lebanon Saturday, killing
*  at least seven members of Hezbollah.
*  There are reports the dead included a grandson of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
*  Meanwhile, in the Red Sea, a U.K.-owned cargo ship, the Ruby Mar, sank on Saturday, days
*  after it was attacked by Houthi forces from Yemen.
*  Greenpeace has warned the sinking could result in a major environmental crisis since the
*  ship was carrying 21,000 metric tons of fertilizer and a large amount of fuel.
*  The Ruby Mar is the first ship to sink in the Red Sea since the Houthis began attacking
*  ships to protest Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Nikki Haley beat Donald Trump in the Republican primary in Washington, D.C. Sunday.
*  Haley won about 63 percent of the vote, making her the first woman ever to win a Republican
*  primary.
*  The victory came just a day after Trump easily won Republican caucuses in Michigan, Missouri
*  and Idaho, giving him a commanding lead in the race ahead of Super Tuesday tomorrow.
*  Fifteen states will hold primaries and caucuses.
*  In Ukraine, at least 12 people have died after a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment
*  building in the city of Odessa Saturday.
*  The dead reportedly included at least five children, the youngest being four months old.
*  Other news on Ukraine.
*  The German military has launched an internal probe after a Russian news outlet obtained
*  tape of a private meeting where German officials discussed providing Ukraine with long-range
*  missiles that could be used to destroy the Karach bridge, which links Russia to occupied
*  Crimea.
*  During the leaked call, one German general is heard saying, quote,
*  "'There is no real reason to say we can't do this.
*  It only depends on the political red lines,' he said."
*  In Russia, crowds are continuing to lay flowers at the grave of opposition leader Alexei Navalny,
*  buried Friday after thousands attended his funeral in Moscow.
*  Navalny died two weeks ago at an Arctic prison.
*  According to one count, 45 people were arrested across Russia for publicly paying respects
*  to Navalny.
*  We'll have more on Russia later in the program.
*  The United Nations' human rights chief has called on the warring sides in Sudan to give
*  safe access to humanitarian agencies as the crisis worsens.
*  Volker Turk spoke Friday.
*  Sudan has become a living nightmare.
*  Almost half of the population, 25 million people, are in urgent need of food and medical
*  aid.
*  Some 80 percent of hospitals have been put out of service.
*  The apparently deliberate denial of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies
*  within Sudan itself constitutes a serious violation of international law and may amount
*  to war crime.
*  Volker Turk speaking in Geneva on Friday.
*  Lawmakers in Pakistan have elected Shahbaz Sharif to serve as Pakistan's new prime
*  minister for a second time, despite protests by supporters of Imran Khan, the imprisoned
*  former leader of Pakistan, ousted in 2022.
*  Allies of Khan won the most seats in February's election, but fell short of a majority, allowing
*  Sharif to form a coalition government.
*  Khan's supporters say the election in February was rigged to prevent them from winning more
*  seats.
*  This is Artaj Ghul, who served in Khan's government.
*  Shahbaz Sharif cannot deliver to this country because he is not elected by the people of
*  Pakistan.
*  He has stolen the credit of the people of PTI people, and he has stolen the vote of
*  Pakistani people.
*  He cannot deliver.
*  He has been imposed on the public of Pakistan.
*  Haiti has declared a 72-hour state of emergency after armed groups stormed two of the country's
*  largest prisons, freeing as many as 4,000 prisoners.
*  The jailbreak came as Haiti's unelected and deeply unpopular prime minister, Ariel
*  Henry, was visiting Kenya to sign an agreement that would allow the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan
*  police officers to Haiti as part of a U.S.-backed security plan.
*  One of the most powerful gang leaders in Haiti, Jimmy Charizier, who is known as Barbecue,
*  has openly threatened to topple Henry, who has ruled Haiti with the backing of the U.S.
*  since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021.
*  Charizier spoke on Friday.
*  We ask the Haitian National Police and the military to take responsibility and arrest
*  Ariel Henry.
*  Once again, the population is not our enemy.
*  The armed groups are not your enemy.
*  You arrest Ariel Henry for the country's liberation.
*  These weapons that we have are not here to hurt our brothers who come from the same milieu
*  as us.
*  The poor take the streets and they trust us.
*  These weapons are our symbol of freedom.
*  With these weapons, we will liberate the country and these weapons will change the country.
*  The largest wildfire in Texas history continues to grow and is spread into Oklahoma.
*  As of Sunday, the Smokehouse Creek fire was only 15 percent contained and had burned a
*  size of land larger than the state of Rhode Island.
*  Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Sunday the blaze, which occurred amidst
*  record heat, is a sign that the nation must be better prepared for extreme weather caused
*  by climate change.
*  In health news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped its guidance that
*  individuals who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate for five days.
*  Under the new guidelines, the CDC urges people to stay home until symptoms improve and they
*  have been fever-free for 24 hours.
*  The new guidelines are similar to CDC recommendations for flu and other respiratory viruses.
*  Federal authorities are investigating the death of Nex Benedict, a 16-year-old non-binary
*  high school sophomore who died in February, a day after they were assaulted by three girls
*  in a high school bathroom.
*  The U.S. Education Department said Friday it's open to probe into whether the Owasso
*  Public Schools District, quote, failed to appropriately respond to alleged harassment,
*  unquote, faced by Nex.
*  Family members said Nex has faced bullying since last year.
*  Their cause of death has yet to be determined.
*  And a judge in Colorado is sentenced to paramedic to five years in prison for his role in the
*  2019 death of Elijah McClain, the 23-year-old black young man who was walking home from
*  when he was tackled by police, placed in a carrot-head hold and later injected with ketamine,
*  a powerful sedative.
*  The sentencing of Peter Cicuniak comes after he and another paramedic were found guilty
*  in December of criminally negligent homicide for McClain's death.
*  During the trial, an expert witness testified there was no reason for the paramedics to
*  give McClain ketamine.
*  They were also found to have failed to provide medical care to McClain after they drugged
*  him and he lay handcuffed and unconscious on the ground.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
