# Top U.S. & World Headlines — June 25, 2024
**Democracy Now:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8XtsvIEglg)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could be just hours away from freedom after he accepted
*  a plea deal with the U.S. government and was released from a U.K. prison.
*  Assange took off from London's Stansted Airport Monday, ending a 12-year-long ordeal
*  that saw him take shelter at the Ecuadorian embassy for seven years, followed by five
*  years in Belmarsh Prison to avoid extradition to the United States, where he faced up to
*  175 years in prison for publishing classified documents exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq
*  and Afghanistan.
*  Julian Assange's jet has stopped in Bangkok to refuel before it continues on to Saipan
*  in the northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, where he's expected
*  to plead guilty to one espionage charge of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate
*  classified national defense information.
*  He will then fly to his home country of Australia to be reunited with his family.
*  Julian's wife, Stella Assange, spoke to Reuters earlier today.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, I think that the correct course of action from the U.S. government should have
*  been to drop the case entirely.
*  We will be seeking a pardon, obviously.
*  But the fact that there is a guilty plea under the Espionage Act in relation to obtaining
*  and disclosing national defense information is obviously a very serious concern for journalists
*  and national security journalists in general.
*  We'll have more on this story after headlines.
*  We'll speak with Julian's brother and other advocates for his freedom.
*  In Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed dozens of Palestinians over the past day, including
*  14 people who were sheltering in U.N.-run schools in northern Gaza.
*  Another attack on Khan Yunis killed at least 10 Palestinians as they were either seeking
*  or helping shield aid supplies.
*  UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini offered a stark assessment of the situation in Gaza nine months
*  into Israel's slaughter.
*  Gaza has been decimated.
*  For more than two million Gazans, it is a living hell.
*  A nightmare from which they cannot wake.
*  Catastrophic levels of hunger across the Gaza Strip are the result of human action.
*  Children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration, while food and clean water wait in trucks.
*  In Gaza City, Palestinians mourn the death of two medical workers killed by Israel, including
*  Gaza's director of ambulance and emergency services, Hani Al-Jafaroui.
*  This is Hatem al-Swerki, who works at the Ministry of Health.
*  We appeal to the international institutions to take a clear stance on these continuous
*  targeted attacks, as we have lost more than 400 health professionals in the Gaza Strip
*  and mourn detention.
*  We lost dozens of health institutions to complete or partial destruction.
*  We say to the world, isn't it time for you to stand up and to protect the Palestinian
*  human, to protect medical crews and institutions, to respect the Palestinian ambulance badge?
*  An Israeli airstrike in the Shati refugee camp reportedly killed 10 relatives of Hamas
*  leader Ismail Kania, including his sister.
*  Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have carried out more violent raids
*  and arrested another 25 people.
*  Israel's top court has ruled that ultra-orthodox Jews in Yeshiva schools are subject to the
*  military draft and must immediately enlist or lose government funding.
*  The Supreme Court decision risks further destabilizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fragile
*  government coalition, which relies on two ultra-orthodox parties.
*  In Ukraine, Russian missile attacks killed at least five people and injured dozens of
*  others in the eastern town of Pokrovsk.
*  Meanwhile, Russia summoned the U.S. ambassador in Moscow and vowed to retaliate after a deadly
*  Ukrainian strike on Crimea Sunday, which Russia says was carried out using U.S.-supplied missiles
*  known as Ataksym.
*  In Kenya, police deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons on demonstrators
*  as organizers called for a national strike and seven days of rage to protest proposed
*  tax hikes and demanding the resignation of Kenyan President William Ruto.
*  Among the protesters was Alma Obama, the half-sister of Barack Obama, who was tear gassed by police
*  during a live interview on CNN.
*  How can you tear gas your own people?
*  Listen to them!
*  Listen to these children!
*  They are the future!
*  They are 80 percent of our population!
*  80 percent!
*  If they decided to turn against us, they can!
*  And that is what they are doing now.
*  Reports have also emerged of a number of protesters who have gone missing.
*  Authorities are surrounding the Kenyan parliament in Nairobi, which protesters plan to occupy.
*  In other news from Kenya, armed forces are readying to deploy to Haiti, with some 400
*  officers set to arrive there later this week.
*  President William Ruto Monday held a ceremony for the first contingent of the U.N.-backed
*  troops, part of a larger mission to combat worsening gang violence in Haiti.
*  Many Haitians have opposed the mission, citing past international interventions that have
*  contributed to political destabilization and humanitarian crises in Haiti.
*  In New Caledonia, fresh protests have erupted after France extradited seven independence
*  activists, including protest leader Christian Thien, for pre-trial detention.
*  New Caledonia has been under French control since its colonization by France in the 19th
*  century, but some 40 percent of the population is Kanaq, and a growing independence movement
*  is seeking to end colonial rule.
*  Back in the U.S., the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge from the Biden administration
*  to a Tennessee law blocking gender-affirming care for transgender youth.
*  The case, which will be heard in the next term, could have major implications for trans rights
*  and dozens of other Republican-led states.
*  Rallies were held in front of the Supreme Court and across the country Monday, as the
*  nation marked two years since the right-wing-led court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the
*  constitutional right to an abortion.
*  Nearly two dozen states have since restricted abortion, with 14 states now banning the
*  procedure.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris spoke in Phoenix, Arizona, at a reproductive rights event marking
*  the anniversary of the Dobbs ruling.
*  — Two years ago today, the highest court in our land took a constitutional right that
*  had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America, and thereafter,
*  in state after state.
*  Laws have been proposed in the past that criminalize health care providers.
*  You know, in Texas, they provide prison for life.
*  In related news, a new study shows Texas has seen a 13 percent increase in infant and newborn
*  deaths since the state imposed an abortion ban.
*  And abortion is expected to be a major issue in Thursday night's debate between President
*  Biden and former President Donald Trump.
*  In Louisiana, a group of multi-faith and non-religious parents has filed a lawsuit over
*  the state's new law mandating the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms.
*  This is Plaintiff Jeff Sims, a Presbyterian pastor with children in Louisiana public schools.
*  — This new law doesn't just interfere with my and my children's religious freedom.
*  It tramples on it.
*  — The separation of church and state means that families get to decide if,
*  when and how their children should be introduced to religious scripture and texts, not the state.
*  — And prosecutors are recommending the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Boeing
*  after the company violated a 2021 settlement that would have shielded Boeing from prosecution over
*  two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed all 346 people on board.
*  The Justice Department has until July 7th to decide whether to prosecute Boeing.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
