*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=3.52s)]
*  We end today's show with an incredible new animated short film. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=4.9s)]
*  It's called The Injustice of Justice. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=8.52s)]
*  It's illustrated by the world-renowned artist Mollie Crabapple and is narrated and written [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=11.72s)]
*  by a man on Ohio's death row, Keith Lamar. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=17.44s)]
*  Keith Lamar will join us live from death row in a moment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=20.8s)]
*  He's long maintained he was wrongfully convicted and is fighting his pending execution. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=25.6s)]
*  The Injustice of Justice just won the grand prize for the best animated short film at [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=30.48s)]
*  the Golden State Film Festival. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=36.64s)]
*  Keith Lamar made history by being the first-ever death row prisoner to call in to speak at [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  his own film premiere and to engage the audience. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=45.0s)]
*  This is the full short film, in which Lamar describes how he found himself sentenced to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=48.16s)]
*  death after the 1993 Lucasville prison uprising at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=53.68s)]
*  where he was being held. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=60.0s)]
*  This is The Injustice of Justice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=62.16s)]
*  My name is Keith Lamar. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=66.08s)]
*  I'm a poet, author and musician. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=67.08s)]
*  For the past 31 years, I've been in solitary confinement, buried under the never-ending [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=71.16s)]
*  agony of sensory deprivation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=77.56s)]
*  On January 13, 2027, the state of Ohio intends to kill me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=80.16s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=86.2s)]
*  Thousands of people around the country and the world have rallied around my cause, joining [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  me in my demand for justice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=94.16s)]
*  Here's my story. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=97.08s)]
*  When I was 19 years old and selling drugs, a group of would-be robbers in search of money [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=99.2s)]
*  forced their way into my apartment, a shootout ensued. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=106.27999999999999s)]
*  And regrettably, I took someone's life and was myself shot twice in the legs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=109.64s)]
*  Facing a long prison sentence and on the advice of counsel, I pled guilty to murder and was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=115.32s)]
*  sentenced to serve 18 years to life. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=121.36s)]
*  Determined to redeem myself and make good on my potential, I completed my GED, enrolled [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  in college and became a voracious reader in an attempt to repair myself to society. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=131.26s)]
*  I was in the fourth year of my sentence when, in 1993, a riot erupted inside the prison. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=137.98s)]
*  Apparently, a group of Muslim prisoners on religious grounds refused to submit to mandatory [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=145.5s)]
*  tuberculosis testing and were given an ultimatum, take the test or else. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=152.54s)]
*  Amid rumors of a forced inoculation, the Muslims took over the prison in protest, releasing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=158.46s)]
*  some 400 prisoners from their cells and setting into motion an 11-day standoff that would [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=165.26s)]
*  ultimately claim the lives of one guard and nine prisoners. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  I was on the recreation yard when it all began. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=175.78s)]
*  A guard came running out of the building with blood streaming down his face, followed by [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  a masked prisoner who was carrying a weapon and yelling. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  He'd taken over. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=188.02s)]
*  Against my better judgment, I went inside to check on my personal belongings. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=190.38000000000002s)]
*  A fatal mistake. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  It was complete chaos. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=197.18s)]
*  When I made it to my assigned location, I discovered that it was being used as a holding [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=199.18s)]
*  area for hostages, both guards and prisoners. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=204.18s)]
*  I was thereafter approached by a masked prisoner who gave me the option to either participate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=208.22s)]
*  or leave. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=213.06s)]
*  I chose to leave. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=215.22s)]
*  Hundreds of us gathered on the yard, waiting as the National Guard and Highway Patrol [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=218.22s)]
*  took up watch outside the perimeter fence. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=224.22s)]
*  Later, when dead bodies were dumped into the yard, they stood by and did nothing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  It was as if I was trapped inside a nightmare. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Around 2 a.m. the following morning, we were rounded up and herded into the gymnasium where [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  we were stripped naked and then violently forced in random groups of 10 into cells [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=242.94s)]
*  meant for one person. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=248.98s)]
*  Stressed and stretched to the limit, a fight broke out over food. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=252.54s)]
*  Tragically, I stood back and watched as a man named Dennis Weaver was held down by three [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=257.02s)]
*  prisoners and choked to death. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=262.26s)]
*  It was a cowardly thing to do, and I can now see and admit that, but at the time, I was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=264.54s)]
*  worried about my own life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=270.3s)]
*  When I was later questioned by authorities, I claimed to have been asleep. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=272.62s)]
*  It was my way of telling them that I didn't want to be involved. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=276.3s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=281.26s)]
*  Because I had gone into the hostage area without wearing a mask, my name would be mentioned [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  among a vast array of potential suspects. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=287.74s)]
*  Even though the state conceded that I was never affiliated with any of the gangs said [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=290.94s)]
*  to have presided over the ride, the fact that I was already serving time for murder would [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=295.5s)]
*  play a big part in their decision to indict me. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=300.22s)]
*  Ultimately, I was charged with nine counts of aggravated murder. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=307.3s)]
*  Mind you, it was never expected that I would actually demand a trial. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=310.54s)]
*  He copped out once, he'll cop out again, was the prevailing belief. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=313.98s)]
*  In fact, no sooner than I was indicted, I was offered a deal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=318.66s)]
*  Plead guilty and we'll run the time concurrent with the time you're already serving. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=323.1s)]
*  In other words, I would have gotten off easier had I actually killed someone. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=328.22s)]
*  But why me? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=332.62s)]
*  Why was I singled out for this undeserved retribution? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=335.82s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=338.94s)]
*  One that I've spent the better part of three decades trying to explain. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=341.58s)]
*  Here's what I can tell you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=346.26s)]
*  When the riot came to an end, Oberzeila's officials rushed into the prison without first securing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  the massive crime scene, rendering inadmissible some 22,000 pieces of evidence. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=354.22s)]
*  So there was absolutely no evidence to link anyone to crimes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  This meant the state had to rely solely on the uncorrelated testimony of jailhouse informants, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=365.1s)]
*  the most unreliable witnesses of all. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=371.26000000000005s)]
*  What to do? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=375.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, the first thing the state did was enlist the help and expertise of the Hamilton County [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=376.54s)]
*  Prosecutors Office. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=382.22s)]
*  This was not a random selection. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=383.74s)]
*  Hamilton County has the dubious distinction of convicting and executing more than half [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=385.98s)]
*  of all death row prisoners in the United States. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=391.5s)]
*  And how have they been so successful? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=395.26s)]
*  The answer is simple and deadly through the impaneling of all white juries, the use of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=397.74s)]
*  paid jailhouse informants, and the intentional withholding of exculpatory evidence. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=405.42s)]
*  I have now in my possession the statement of an actual perpetrator who admitted to murdering [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  someone for whom I was sentenced to death. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=416.14s)]
*  And this is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=418.7s)]
*  They withheld so much more. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=421.02s)]
*  It's over three decades later now, and I'm still in solitary confinement, being tortured [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=424.78s)]
*  because I refused to plead guilty to something I didn't do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=431.02s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=435.5s)]
*  Look, we kid ourselves when we speak of justice. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  Until we have a process that holds everyone equally accountable for their actions, this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=441.82s)]
*  system will remain what it has always been, a punishment system. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=447.02s)]
*  And as we all know, those who don't have the capital get the punishment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=452.94s)]
*  That's the new award-winning short film The Injustice of Justice, illustrated by [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=457.82s)]
*  the world-renowned artist Molly Crabapple, narrated and written by Keith Lamar, who's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=469.26s)]
*  fighting to raise awareness about his case and death row. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=475.34s)]
*  He faces execution January of 2027. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=479.1s)]
*  The film The Injustice of Justice just won the grand prize for the best animated short [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=483.97999999999996s)]

*  Keith Lamar has been held in prison for 36 years, 32 years in solitary confinement, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=495.41999999999996s)]

*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, Keith Lamar. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=518.14s)]
*  Keith Lamar I argue it's such an honor and pleasure. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=520.38s)]
*  I can tell you, I'm not just speaking for myself, but for so many people who are inside. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=525.5s)]

*  Can you talk about the making of this film, explaining your case and what you're hoping [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=539.82s)]
*  to accomplish right now? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=549.26s)]
*  You have made this film, you do live concerts that are performed around the world, remarkably, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=551.26s)]

*  of other books as well, with high schools and other places. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=569.02s)]
*  Talk about your message, Keith. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=574.46s)]
*  Keith Lamar Well, I, you know, from the very beginning, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=576.38s)]
*  just wanted to stand on my innocence. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=581.42s)]
*  You know, it was never really a matter of me not wanting to speak out, to stand up for myself. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=584.78s)]
*  That was the whole point of me demanding the trial. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=589.58s)]
*  But the whole system, I soon found out, is sitting around obedience, around operating [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=593.42s)]
*  within prescribed parameters and whatnot. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=597.58s)]
*  And I was advised to remain quiet during my trial and the day after, and I did. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=600.54s)]
*  You know, I went along with it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=607.74s)]
*  You know, that's what we do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=609.66s)]
*  And, you know, other smarter, more learned people would speak on my behalf, would stand [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=613.1s)]
*  up and fight for my life. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=619.74s)]
*  You know, and I believed that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=621.9s)]
*  And I just kept going deeper and deeper into the darkness until I found myself in this [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=623.98s)]
*  really, really desperate place where I was really standing on the brink of my existence. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, I had to find out the hard way that in order for my life to be mine, that I had [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=635.74s)]
*  to stand up and claim it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=640.22s)]
*  You know, so that was really the thing that was the catalyst that pushed me to start [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=642.38s)]
*  speaking up and reaching to utilize my own agency. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  And all of these things that you just mentioned is a product of that general thrust. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, that thing that just comes to the conclusion that if I don't stand up right [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=656.78s)]
*  now, then I might lose my life. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  And so that was the thing that kind of started the movie. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=664.3s)]
*  You know, I first started, I wrote the book, The Tremendous Condemned, and that was over [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=669.98s)]
*  200 pages. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=673.98s)]
*  And not long after that, a dear friend of mine, Lloyd Swain, produced a documentary [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=675.26s)]
*  which was 30 minutes. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=682.54s)]
*  And so we was trying to figure out a way to condense it even more because, you know, of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=684.3s)]
*  course, people have short attention spans. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=689.5s)]
*  We understand, I understand that people have their own problems, have their own lives to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=691.5s)]
*  live up. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=695.98s)]
*  And so, you know, it's asking a lot to ask someone to sit down and read a 200-some page [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=696.46s)]
*  book or 30-minute documentaries. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=701.34s)]
*  But we thought that if we could condense the story into a seven-minute short, then possibly [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=703.4200000000001s)]
*  that could garner more attention. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=709.9000000000001s)]
*  So that was the whole impetus behind creating the movie. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=711.26s)]
*  You know, my friend, my campaign manager, Ann Gordell, was at the museum, Brightest [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=715.34s)]
*  Stakers Museum in Alabama and saw a movie that Molly Crappapple had produced. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=719.74s)]
*  And she had the idea from that that maybe this could be applied to my story, and we [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=724.78s)]
*  can, you know, put forth a similar project. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  And we contacted Molly and her team and, you know, was able to raise the funding through [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=732.38s)]
*  this very kind individual named David Rouse. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=741.02s)]
*  And, you know, next thing we know, we had a movie on our hands. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=744.14s)]
*  And so, yeah, I'm really, really grateful for the whole process, for sure. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=748.3s)]
*  So, Keith Lamar, in your book Condemned, about Bobby Sands, if you can explain who he is, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=751.66s)]
*  his hunger strike and how it inspired you to go on a hunger strike, which led to your [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=760.54s)]
*  case being known. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=765.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've been written about in The New York Times. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=766.0999999999999s)]
*  You have jazz greats playing with you, supporting your cause. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=769.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, one of my friends who I think you might know named Stouten Lynn was a famous historian, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=775.74s)]
*  social activist. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=783.5799999999999s)]
*  He, in the beginning, when I was first sentenced to death, he somehow found his way into my [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  life. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=792.38s)]
*  And he sent me that book by Bobby Sands, Nothing But an Unfinished Song, written by Dennis O'Hern, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=793.26s)]
*  who had since become a very close friend of mine. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=799.18s)]
*  He sent me that book. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=802.22s)]
*  And as I was reading it, it felt as if I was being sent a message. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=803.34s)]
*  If I had been pleading with these people, it's going on 18 years in a simple suit with [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=807.34s)]
*  eight years old, to no avail. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=813.98s)]
*  And, you know, I was reading this book, and it was almost a last-ditch effort before I [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=817.42s)]
*  was about to give up. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=822.62s)]
*  And Bobby Sands and his comrade, Bobby Sands, for those who don't know, was an Irish prisoner [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  who, along with several of his comrades, went on a hunger strike in Ireland. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=830.38s)]
*  And, you know, some of their demands were very basic, just to be treated as human beings, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=835.1s)]
*  which, of course, resonated with me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=839.58s)]
*  And not long after I finished that book, I reached out to the author, Dennis O'Hern, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=841.82s)]
*  and I wrote him. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=847.34s)]
*  We struck up a correspondence. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=848.3s)]
*  He came to see me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=849.82s)]
*  We became really close friends. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  And I decided to undergo an act of hunger strike myself, along with several other [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=853.1s)]
*  prisoners here at the supermax, went on hunger strike. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=859.5s)]
*  And after 18 years of not being able to break through court cases and all that, and 12 days [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=864.0600000000001s)]
*  of being on a hunger strike, I was sitting in the visiting room with my family. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=870.46s)]
*  And that was like a seminal moment in my journey. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=875.0200000000001s)]
*  It kind of taught me that if anything is going to change, you have to stand up and speak out, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=878.7800000000001s)]
*  you know, on your own. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=884.38s)]
*  And, you know, one of my literary heroes, Richard Wright, he wrote in his book Black [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=885.4200000000001s)]
*  Boy that if you speak out who you are, you will discover that you are not alone. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=890.22s)]
*  And, you know, then it started to take a fine minute. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=895.9s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=899.6600000000001s)]
*  I wanted to bring in your lawyer, Keegan Stefan. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=900.22s)]
*  In one of Trump's first executive orders, January 20th, was to restore the death penalty, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=905.74s)]
*  Trump said, which includes the order that the attorney general ensures all states have [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=911.42s)]
*  necessary drugs. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=917.74s)]
*  This is Keith's second execution date. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=918.78s)]
*  What is it? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  January 13th, 2027. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=922.2199999999999s)]
*  If you can explain what happens right now in court, where the case stands in court [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  and the role of the Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, the position he has taken, since he, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=933.18s)]
*  not Trump, would decide what happens ultimately to Keith Lamar. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=939.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=946.38s)]
*  Hi, Amy, and thanks for elevating Keith's case. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=946.78s)]
*  Keith, unfortunately, exhausted his direct appeals long ago. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=950.38s)]
*  The state courts and federal courts looked at his trial and determined, incorrectly, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=954.54s)]
*  that there were no constitutional deficiencies and upheld his conviction and his death sentence. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=959.5799999999999s)]
*  I do think that any fair-minded jurist looking at his trial now would deem it unconstitutional [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=964.6999999999999s)]
*  and overturn his convictions. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=971.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, the only way back into court is to find newly discovered evidence. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  So me and a team of attorneys have been reviewing all the records in his case and talking to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=977.66s)]
*  witnesses for the last two years, trying to turn up new newly discovered evidence. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=981.74s)]
*  We have discovered a lot of new evidence supporting Keith's innocence. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=986.54s)]
*  I started as a skeptic. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=991.02s)]
*  I'm a prison abolitionist, definitely an abolitionist of the death penalty. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=992.6999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me if he's guilty. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=996.78s)]
*  He shouldn't be put to death. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=998.14s)]
*  But I can tell you, after looking at the record, talking to witnesses, there is no doubt in my [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=999.1s)]
*  mind that he is actually innocent. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1003.02s)]
*  We are working to put together a motion based on the new evidence to get back into court [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1005.42s)]
*  so that we can prove his innocence before his execution date. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1009.74s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is very little justice in the justice system, as Keith has noted. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1013.26s)]
*  It's going to take much more than just litigation. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1018.3s)]
*  We need a mass movements of people, you know, speaking out, acting out and pushing the governor [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1022.14s)]
*  to pause his execution once again while we litigate. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1028.46s)]
*  Let me give the last word to Keith Lamar. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1031.26s)]
*  Keith, your scheduled to die January 13, 2027, second execution date. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1033.26s)]
*  First was for lack of drugs to inject into you. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1038.78s)]
*  Your final message is—what is it? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1043.26s)]
*  May 31, you're expected to have a concert at Joe's Pub here. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1047.42s)]
*  It's your 56th birthday then. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1051.98s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1054.78s)]
*  You know, I've been living under the dread of death, as you noted, at the outset for over [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1055.66s)]
*  three decades. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1060.14s)]
*  So it's not dying. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1061.74s)]
*  I've already made peace with the fact that I'm going to die at some point and some day. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1063.74s)]
*  All of us are. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1068.7s)]
*  But the thing that really drives me is I'm here. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1070.22s)]
*  How can I live? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1073.42s)]
*  You know, you reference all the things that I've accomplished since being on death row, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1075.34s)]
*  and all those things come from a desire just to live, because I'm alive. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1080.06s)]
*  Keith Lamar, thank you for staying with us. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1085.34s)]
*  You've served 36 years in prison, 32 years in solitary confinement, 30 of those years [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1088.3799999999999s)]
*  on death row. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1096.86s)]
*  What is it like to live on death row? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1098.3s)]
*  Well, I think the opposite word is lived on death row. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1102.06s)]
*  I've lived. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, early on when I first came here, I met and was mentored by this older gentleman [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  named Snoop. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1112.62s)]
*  He's the one who turned me on to jazz. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1114.06s)]
*  He's the one who really introduced me to literature, serious books, books that ultimately [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1115.8999999999999s)]
*  changed my self-concept. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1122.3s)]
*  But this is a soul-crushing environment. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  You see a lot of young people coming here without the means and resources to send off [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1130.9399999999998s)]
*  the ills, the ravages of being in this type of place, because sensibly deprivation, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1136.22s)]
*  it robs you of your humanity. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1141.5s)]
*  And before long, you see these young guys unraveling. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1144.22s)]
*  So seeing that and being in proximity to that kind of pain has been really, really devastating. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1148.46s)]
*  But I share books. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1155.1799999999998s)]
*  I share my understanding and wisdom. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1156.54s)]
*  I'm familiar with the young people around me, so I more or less work for this system. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1159.74s)]
*  But in a proactive way, trying to help young people in the ways in which I myself was helped. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1166.3s)]
*  I am in possession of my properties because other people helped me. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  And so I try to extend that help and return. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1181.58s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a soul-crushing environment, definitely. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1184.78s)]
*  Can you talk about your evolution in prison? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1188.3799999999999s)]
*  You went into prison, what, when you were 19 years old? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1192.8600000000001s)]
*  You hadn't graduated from high school. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1197.18s)]
*  Talk about going to school in prison. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1199.9s)]
*  Talk about every—you know, what happened to you since? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1203.5s)]
*  Well, I dropped out in the 10th grade. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1209.26s)]
*  You know, I was still living a hand-in-mouth existence, basically, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1211.42s)]
*  when the crack epidemic exploded in Cleveland, Ohio around 1985, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1215.02s)]
*  1986, when I was around 16 years old or so. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1219.58s)]
*  I had been living on my own for about a year or so at that time, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1223.02s)]
*  and I got beat to the immerse in the child trade. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1226.46s)]
*  And when I came to prison, after the tragic events, we were already spoken about. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1230.9399999999998s)]
*  I got my GED and enrolled in college, but that wasn't really the pivot. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1237.5s)]
*  You know, the pivot happened when I started my own education. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  When I—the first serious book I read was the Art of Artificia of Malcolm X, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1249.02s)]
*  and that was a pivot. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1252.86s)]
*  You know, that was a real eye-opening thing. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1254.3799999999999s)]
*  And I was constantly meeting these real individuals here in prison. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1257.26s)]
*  They mentored me, became father-sisters. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1264.54s)]
*  I joined a boxing team and met the guy who taught me how to play chess. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1266.62s)]
*  I met this guy who taught me how to write, you know, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  the difference between a semicolon and an independent clause. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1272.86s)]
*  I was learning all these things, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1276.3s)]
*  things I didn't learn in school. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1277.58s)]
*  I learned these from other prisoners. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1279.5s)]
*  You know, that's the misconception that a lot of people have about people in prison, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1282.22s)]
*  that we are all animals and all these things, but these are just poor people. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1285.8999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, some of these poor people, when they arrive here, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1290.1399999999999s)]
*  they want to try to understand why they are here. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1292.6999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I began that quest myself. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1295.8999999999999s)]
*  And when I came to death row, all those things kind of— [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1300.78s)]
*  because I had just went through this experience of the trial, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1304.7s)]
*  which was nothing short of a mockery. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1310.6200000000001s)]
*  All the evidence was withheld. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1314.0600000000002s)]
*  22,000 pieces of evidence was burned, as I talk about in the movie. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1316.3000000000002s)]
*  All the, you know, conflicting statements that challenged the state's [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1321.0200000000002s)]
*  characterization of the facts was suppressed. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1325.66s)]
*  You know, an all-white jury wasn't paneled. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1328.46s)]
*  And during the whole trial, the courtroom remained empty. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1330.6200000000001s)]
*  When it was time to sentence me to death, that people showed up. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1334.3799999999999s)]
*  So the community wasn't concerned about the evidence. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1337.1799999999998s)]
*  They were just concerned about the day in which they would be able to watch the lynching. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1340.06s)]
*  And it wasn't until months later, when I was already on death row, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1344.46s)]
*  that I actually saw those famous lynching pictures that you see in books and whatnot. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1347.58s)]
*  And I knew it was something that I had just gone through. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1353.4199999999998s)]
*  And so that, along with my reading, I started reading James Baldwin, Richard Wright, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1357.1799999999998s)]
*  Charles Mills, Luke Walton, Walter Rodney, C.R. Artenes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1362.54s)]
*  I started reading. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1368.3s)]
*  All these people became like active professors in my education, my maturation, and music. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1369.1000000000001s)]
*  My love for jazz grew simultaneously with my love of learning and reading and whatnot. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1380.8600000000001s)]
*  I gradually found my way back to myself. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1390.38s)]
*  I achieved myself. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1394.22s)]
*  Had I taken the deal, I would have died of something of a premature death [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1395.74s)]
*  because I would have never realized who I am today. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1401.66s)]
*  And so I don't have regrets about making that hard decision, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1403.9s)]
*  but it was ignorance that allowed me to do it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1407.74s)]
*  I didn't know what I didn't know about the system and how it functioned. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1410.14s)]
*  And thank God for that. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1414.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because I probably would have taken the easy way out. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1416.0600000000002s)]
*  And missed the opportunity to find out who I was, yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1419.18s)]
*  I want to bring back Keegan-Stephan into this conversation. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1421.66s)]
*  Your lawyer, he's speaking to us from New York City. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1425.5800000000002s)]
*  You're on death row in Ohio State. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1428.14s)]
*  Keegan, if you could explain when Keith talks about taking the deal the first time [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1431.18s)]
*  and then the second time, saying he wanted to go to trial. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1439.98s)]
*  Explain how that—it's not him going into prison. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1444.78s)]
*  Where he went right on to death row. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1448.94s)]
*  It's after the Lucasville uprising. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1451.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1455.5s)]
*  So Keith's original crime of conviction, as everyone heard, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1457.66s)]
*  was for basically a self-defense killing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1461.5s)]
*  When he was selling drugs, when he was very young, someone attempted to rob him. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1465.5s)]
*  He fought back. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1471.5s)]
*  They shot at him. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1472.3s)]
*  He shot back. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1473.02s)]
*  I think most people would deem that a self-defense killing, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1474.94s)]
*  but under a legal doctrine called unclean hands, he couldn't apply that. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1477.66s)]
*  His counsel at the time encouraged him to plead guilty, and he did. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1482.22s)]
*  And then he was sent to Lucasville at a very unfortunate time, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1486.3000000000002s)]
*  right before this uprising occurred. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1489.9s)]
*  And then these murders got pinned on him. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1492.7s)]
*  And then when he was being tried for those murders, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1497.1000000000001s)]
*  he was offered a plea deal, which is a wild plea deal in retrospect, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1501.74s)]
*  that he would have been given time that would have run concurrently with the sentence he [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1506.46s)]
*  was already serving for his original crime of conviction. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1509.9s)]
*  He would have effectively done no more time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1512.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that's a very, very strong signal that they knew they had a weak case, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1515.02s)]
*  but they just wanted somebody to take the fall. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1519.3400000000001s)]
*  But Keith stood on his convictions and his innocence and said he wasn't going to do it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1522.06s)]
*  He wasn't going to admit to murders he hadn't committed. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1527.58s)]
*  And that choice has made all the difference. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1531.5s)]
*  He was convicted despite a trial that was unfair on its face and then turned out to be even more [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1534.78s)]
*  unfair after all of the suppressed evidence came out. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1541.26s)]
*  As Keith mentioned, after trial, he learned that other people had admitted to some of the murders [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1545.02s)]
*  that he was convicted of committing, but those confessions weren't turned over in a usable form. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1551.82s)]
*  Many other people said, you know, who did the murders and didn't name Keith? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1558.3s)]
*  That incredibly exculpatory evidence was not turned over in a usable form. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1564.22s)]
*  All of that was found and used on appeals, but his convictions were upheld [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1568.62s)]
*  in some very unjust decisions. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1573.8999999999999s)]
*  Now his only way back into court is through newly discovered evidence. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1576.3s)]
*  And another motion starting in the state court, which is going to take time to litigate, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1580.06s)]
*  which is what his legal team, including myself, are working on now. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1583.8999999999999s)]
*  And of course, the death date is set for January 13th, 2027. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1587.82s)]
*  Keegan, can you talk about President Trump's executive order? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1594.06s)]
*  I think it was on the first day, on January 20th, where he tried to make sure the attorney general [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1599.02s)]
*  gets execution drugs to the states. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1604.7s)]
*  In fact, that's why Keith Lamar's first execution date was vacated, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1607.34s)]
*  because Ohio didn't have the drugs to inject in him. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1612.94s)]
*  Yes, it's a horrifying executive order. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1617.98s)]
*  I think it exemplifies that the cruelness is the point of this administration. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1621.34s)]
*  Many drug companies are sort of uncomfortable providing the drugs that are used to [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1626.46s)]
*  affect executions in this country. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1634.14s)]
*  And for that reason, Ohio has been unable to execute people since Governor DeWine has [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1636.54s)]
*  taken office. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1641.18s)]
*  They've said that they won't supply it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1644.78s)]
*  And then Governor DeWine has said if he can't have those drugs for medically necessary [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1646.94s)]
*  purposes, then he doesn't want to not be able to get them just to use them for executions. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1651.8200000000002s)]
*  President Trump's executive order is encouraging the DOJ to get involved and kind of put pressure [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1659.9s)]
*  on these drug companies to provide drugs in ways that they have said that they ethically [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1665.5s)]
*  do not want to, which is another horrifying use of executive power to put pressure on private [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1670.8600000000001s)]
*  actors to do things they don't want to do ethically and morally. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1676.94s)]
*  It's horrifying, and it may in fact enable Ohio to move forward with executions, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1681.18s)]
*  which could likely make Keith's current execution date a very real execution date, which is a [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1687.5s)]
*  absolutely terrifying prospect. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1692.46s)]
*  I've spent time with Keith on death row. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1694.14s)]
*  He is the most incredible human being I've met living at liberty or incarcerated. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1696.6200000000001s)]
*  He is brilliant and artistic. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1701.42s)]
*  He's absolutely innocent, and the state plans to kill him. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1703.1000000000001s)]
*  How do you live with the specter, Keith Lamar, over your head, the specter of death, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1707.8200000000002s)]
*  that there is a date for you to die? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1714.06s)]
*  Keith Lamar, Chief Executive Officer, Ohio State Department of Justice [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1718.14s)]
*  The test of your existence is daunting. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1719.02s)]
*  I won't even try to, you know, deny that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1721.26s)]
*  But if I focus too much on it, Amy, it will immobilize me. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1726.78s)]
*  It will stop me or prevent me from doing the things that need to be done. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1730.94s)]
*  A lot of times when you see guys in my situation, you very rarely hear from them directly. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1734.7s)]
*  There's always someone else speaking for them, and sometimes that's because there's rules to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1740.06s)]
*  prevent you from speaking on your behalf. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1745.18s)]
*  But we filed a lawsuit, and so I'm perfectly within my rights to do what I'm doing, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1746.78s)]
*  to speak out for my life, and I tend to do that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1752.06s)]
*  Thinking about what you just asked Keith about, the executive order, and it's massive. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1756.8600000000001s)]
*  It's maddening when you think about, you know, here's a person who, you know, rants and raves [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1764.8600000000001s)]
*  about the injustice of the system when it relates to him personally. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1770.7s)]
*  And yet you see the overhaul that's going on where there's no awareness or connection to [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1775.18s)]
*  his own personal experience. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1780.3s)]
*  I mean, if he's to believe the system is corrupt, and yet the same person is armed [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1782.6200000000001s)]
*  in this very corrupt system to take other people's lives, human beings' lives, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1787.9s)]
*  but it's on par or other piece with everything else that flows from the system and where we are [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1791.74s)]
*  right now, the direction that we are moving in right now as a country. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1796.54s)]
*  But me personally, I have all these amazing people who are actually fighting with me, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1800.78s)]
*  not for me, but with me. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1805.58s)]
*  And for that, I'm really, really, I'm truly grateful. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1807.66s)]
*  I try not to dwell too much on the execution date, because I don't want to give it validity [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1810.38s)]
*  where that becomes a self-fulfilling thing in my life. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1818.7s)]
*  I want to move in the opposite direction and push against that, you know, in every way possible. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1821.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1827.5s)]
*  I wanted to bring Amy Gordeyev into this conversation. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1828.38s)]
*  She's the director of the Justice for Keith Lamar Foundation, speaking to us, I believe, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1831.5s)]
*  also from Youngstown, but not inside the prison, outside. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1837.26s)]
*  She's a high school teacher. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1841.18s)]
*  Amy, can you talk about what the Justice for Keith Lamar Foundation is and the kind of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1843.02s)]
*  global outreach that Keith has been able to do from prison with the support, as he said, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1851.34s)]
*  of people working with him? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1859.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on, Amy. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1862.06s)]
*  Justice for Keith Lamar has evolved. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1865.66s)]
*  It used to be just a group of friends and supporters here in Ohio, and it was kind of [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1868.78s)]
*  a slogan we had. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1875.9s)]
*  But in time, as our movement grew, we realized we needed to develop this into something [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1877.1000000000001s)]
*  more organized, and so we are now a 501c3 nonprofit organization. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1884.22s)]
*  Our mission is to bring healing and support to those who are wrongfully convicted. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1889.8200000000002s)]
*  And so, as Keith has advocated for himself, it really, for me, I saw a lot of returns [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1897.82s)]
*  after he published his book, Condemned. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1906.2199999999998s)]
*  It just meant that people knew his story and wanted to be more involved with him, just [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1909.26s)]
*  engaging in their various platforms. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, the music led us to different continents, all over the world, really. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1918.06s)]
*  And it's been really a very, very beautiful, meaningful thing to be able to involve more [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1926.78s)]
*  and more people who hear his story. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1931.58s)]
*  And again, what Keith said is so true that he is rare in this area because so often, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1933.74s)]
*  someone has talked about, and they sit out of reach and out of our earshot. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1940.62s)]
*  And here's Keith advocating for himself at every step of the way. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1946.46s)]
*  So he really inspires those who join us, and we're inviting everybody who's listening [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  to do so, too. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1955.5s)]
*  All of this kind of came through a grassroots movement. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1958.3s)]
*  And so now today, you can go on keithlemar.org and you can see his podcast, listen to those, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1961.18s)]
*  read articles that he has published and that have been written about him. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1967.74s)]
*  His petition is there. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1972.62s)]
*  There's a way to make donations. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1974.14s)]
*  We are hard, hard at work fighting for him, and it's a very, very expensive endeavor. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1975.82s)]
*  So we welcome that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1981.1s)]
*  And again, we are a 501c3. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1982.3s)]
*  We can provide that support to folks. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1984.14s)]
*  There is a way to buy merch like I'm wearing. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1987.5s)]
*  I often wear that. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1991.26s)]
*  These are great conversation starters. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1992.38s)]
*  And really, our aim there is to help people find a way to connect. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1994.6200000000001s)]
*  I would invite folks to add their name to the email list at the bottom. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=1999.98s)]
*  Occasionally, we will send out a newsletter. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2004.3000000000002s)]
*  Again, you'll hear directly from Keith in that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2006.8600000000001s)]
*  And also to follow our social media pages, which is all one word, at justice for Keith Lamar [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2009.5s)]
*  on Instagram and Facebook. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2017.18s)]
*  And that's where we can kind of have everybody in the queue for when it's time to make direct [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2018.7s)]
*  calls to the governor in Ohio. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2026.3s)]
*  All of these things, we're working in tandem with Keith's legal team. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2028.3s)]
*  And the strategy, you know, it has to be timely. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2032.14s)]
*  We do need people to be bold and to join us and to share his story and to help us grow [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2035.58s)]
*  that movement so when the time comes, we're ready and we make a huge impact. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2041.34s)]
*  I want to go back to Keith Lamar live on death row at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2045.98s)]
*  not far from where Amy is right now, who's about to teach in high school in Youngstown. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2053.58s)]
*  Keith, I'm looking at an article in The New York Times from a few years ago. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2059.58s)]
*  Jazz freed Keith Lamar's soul. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2063.74s)]
*  Can it help him get off death row? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2065.66s)]
*  And it says, with concerts and a new album, musicians are trying to draw attention to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2067.74s)]
*  the case of an inmate convicted in the death of five other prisoners who they believe deserves [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2072.14s)]
*  a new trial. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2077.42s)]
*  And it talks about your working together with jazz musicians, with some of the greats, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2078.7799999999997s)]
*  like Albert Marquez, who's the pianist, composer, New York City schoolteacher, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2083.8999999999996s)]
*  people like Brian Jackson, Salim Washington, Arturo Farrell, Carolyn Davis, who are involved [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2088.38s)]
*  with these Freedom First concerts and the concerts that will lead up to the big event [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2095.6600000000003s)]
*  at Joe's Pub on May 31st, your 56th birthday. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2100.62s)]
*  What's it like to make this music together? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2105.7400000000002s)]
*  You with the poetry, I saw the picture in your room. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2109.1800000000003s)]
*  You've got a keyboard? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2111.98s)]
*  Yeah, I have a keyboard, you know, and a beginner's manual on how to play it, which, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2113.58s)]
*  because of all the things you mentioned, I haven't really had too much time. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2118.7000000000003s)]
*  But it's aspirational, more than anything, to be honest. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2122.06s)]
*  So how do you work together? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2126.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2128.38s)]
*  Well, same way I'm working with you right now. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2130.46s)]
*  I'm sitting here, west between the toilet and the door, and it's real uncomfortable [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2133.58s)]
*  but I have my eyes closed. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2139.7400000000002s)]
*  I have on a pair of ear bulbs and I just leave it all to the universe, whatever. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2141.34s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2150.46s)]
*  I mean, it shouldn't be possible. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2151.5s)]
*  I say that in the lyrics. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2152.78s)]
*  Shouldn't even be doable, the things that we are doing. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2154.78s)]
*  Albert Marquez, who you mentioned, had the idea after exchanging letters with me that [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2158.46s)]
*  we could probably collaborate in this particular medium to elevate my story. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2164.14s)]
*  And I was a little doubtful at first, but I gave it a try. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2171.3399999999997s)]
*  And as you said, these are world-renowned musicians. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2177.58s)]
*  These are not just people who are standing on the sidelines. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2180.46s)]
*  These are working musicians. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2183.66s)]
*  People on their own right are pretty stellar people. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2185.58s)]
*  And to work with them, it was intimidating. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2192.22s)]
*  To be honest, I went in the studio. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2194.46s)]
*  Albert Marquez sent me some sketches of a song called Telling the Truth. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2196.62s)]
*  That was the first song that we recorded. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2201.66s)]
*  And I was on a video visit here in prison and we went in the studio and I was there live. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2204.14s)]
*  And it was incredibly intimidating when I talked to Artimiro Ferreros' son, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2210.46s)]
*  Zach, who was a drummer on the album. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2216.06s)]
*  He and I, he calmed me down and helped me. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2218.62s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to be able to navigate the stress of the situation. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2222.38s)]
*  And as I repeatedly have done that over and over again around the country and around the world, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2226.54s)]
*  I've become more accustomed, more welcomed into this community of musicians, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2233.34s)]
*  to the point where I can now consider myself a musician. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2237.66s)]
*  And it was all those years of just listening to this music in my cell by myself, John Coltrane, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2241.42s)]
*  Dexter Gordon, Nina Simone, all the greats. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2246.62s)]
*  That was bleeding into my system that Albert Marquez was able to see and help me harness [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2250.54s)]
*  into this beautiful music that we've been making. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2257.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2260.14s)]
*  I mean, it's really unbelievable. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2261.02s)]
*  It really is. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2262.54s)]
*  Can you talk about your book clubs? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2263.66s)]
*  Students around the country, high school kids meeting with you to talk about books. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2266.78s)]
*  Explain how it works. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2271.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, the same way I'm talking to you now. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2274.3s)]
*  I call in and a group of young people are gathered in the classroom. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2277.18s)]
*  When I initially started the book club, it was a temp to pinpoint or go back and see where things [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2284.06s)]
*  went wrong in my own life. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2290.46s)]
*  When I was 13, I was sent away to a juvenile facility for six months. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2291.8199999999997s)]
*  And I had all the things that is prevalent with young people like myself, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2296.54s)]
*  dysfunctional childhood, abuse, and all those things with presence. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2305.66s)]
*  But I'm thinking about what can I do? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2309.74s)]
*  When was the opportunity for me to intervene and change the trajectory of my life? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2311.18s)]
*  Although I started reading seriously when I was in my 20s, I thought that maybe if I can [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2317.8999999999996s)]
*  get some books back to my 13-year-old self, that maybe I can change the trajectory of [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2321.98s)]
*  that young person's life. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2327.66s)]
*  And so I started off going into juvenile facilities here in Ohio. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2328.7s)]
*  And that ultimately grew into this thing where I was going to high schools because I also [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2333.42s)]
*  realized that I was in high school and I wasn't learning anything. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2338.38s)]
*  It's this thing that Carl Young talked about directed thinking and fantasy thinking. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2343.02s)]
*  I was absorbed in the fantasy side of it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2347.5s)]
*  I didn't really know how to connect the dots. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2350.38s)]
*  And reading was the thing that allowed me to kind of cultivate that sense. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2354.7s)]
*  And so I wanted to give that as a gift to young people to help them navigate the complex [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2358.94s)]
*  because life is complicated. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2363.1s)]
*  And it's even more complicated when you are poor and disadvantaged, marginalized, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2364.7000000000003s)]
*  and all those other things. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2369.58s)]
*  And reading, particularly autobiographies, is the thing that helped me. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2370.86s)]
*  And so I wanted to somehow go back and provide this material to young people. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2377.7400000000002s)]
*  And Amy and I have been running the Religion Project, I think, for over a decade now. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2384.7799999999997s)]
*  And people send in books, donate books, and we just donated 150-book library to the Youngstown [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2392.22s)]
*  Juvenile Facility here in Ohio. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2400.14s)]
*  And so that's what we've been doing. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2403.18s)]
*  That's part of the work. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2404.54s)]
*  It's not just about myself and trying to free myself from this trap because I was [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2405.34s)]
*  actually stuck when I was 13. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2411.2599999999998s)]
*  And so my hope and goal is to be able to affect change in other young people's lives. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2414.7s)]
*  So that's the whole drive behind the literacy project. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2422.46s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN Keith Lamar, if you can talk about what it [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2427.18s)]
*  was like to give the graduation address at the Ice High School in New York. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2429.5s)]
*  That's the Institute for Collaborative Education. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2435.42s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Well, it was a privilege. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2438.22s)]
*  It was an honor because obviously because of where I am, you don't expect to be able [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2441.26s)]
*  to be given those opportunities. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2447.0200000000004s)]
*  David Recker, who I know you know, his daughter Maria was in my book club. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2449.5s)]
*  And there were several other kids in my book clubs who would be graduating, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2456.6200000000003s)]
*  with whom I had a very, very close relationship with. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2460.46s)]
*  And I wanted to somehow summarize the exchange that we had, to put it in words, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2463.9s)]
*  to let them know how much I believed in them, to let them know how much I expected from them. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2470.06s)]
*  But to also kind of warn them that the world that you are about to enter into is the real world. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2476.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, and all the things that we have examined… [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2482.62s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN You have one minute remaining. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2485.18s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR All the different things we examined about [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2488.06s)]
*  what it means to be alive, it was time for them to put that in practice. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2490.94s)]
*  So that's what I wanted to say in my speech. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2494.38s)]
*  You know, it's just a real humbling thing to be able to send them off [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2498.46s)]
*  into the world with that message. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2502.38s)]
*  And so, yeah, it was one of the highlights of my life. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2504.06s)]
*  I can honestly say that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2507.5s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN Keith, you heard? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2508.7000000000003s)]
*  You have like 30 seconds to go. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2510.46s)]
*  That's the message from the prison. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2512.54s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Well, let me use these 30 seconds to thank you, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2514.3s)]
*  Amy Goodman. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2518.06s)]
*  When I say that you have been a big part of my life, I mean that literally. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2519.1800000000003s)]
*  You have been a professor, a tour guide. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2524.46s)]
*  You have been my connection to my humanity. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2530.6200000000003s)]
*  And I love you. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2533.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean that from the bottom of my heart, Amy. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2535.26s)]
*  I love you so much. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2537.7400000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much for helping me. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2539.02s)]
*  I love you. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2540.3s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN Keith, thank you very much for spending this time [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2541.98s)]
*  with us live from Death Row, from the Ohio State Prison in Youngstown, Ohio. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2545.02s)]
*  Thank you for using GTL. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2551.98s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN That's what he hears a lot when he's on the phone. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2553.5s)]
*  The Freedom First series, Amy, if you could end by telling us about where he's going to be, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2560.94s)]
*  it's strange to say appearing, but where Keith Lamar can be heard from Death Row, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2569.98s)]
*  Northwestern, Rhodes College, Tufts, the Scripps Campus, UCLA, and finally here in New York, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2576.54s)]
*  how it works. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2583.02s)]
*  KEITH LAMAR Sure. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2583.9s)]
*  Well, as Keith was just explaining, so many of the kids from his high school book clubs at ICE [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2586.62s)]
*  in New York City have graduated and gone on to different colleges around the country, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2595.9s)]
*  inspired to become advocates and to really organize and change the world in lots of ways, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2600.7799999999997s)]
*  not just for him, for Gaza, for all kinds of human rights issues. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2607.58s)]
*  So we will be going to Rhodes College. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2614.7s)]
*  One of his students, Coral, is organizing a concert there. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2619.5s)]
*  We'll be there in April. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2623.02s)]
*  We'll be back to the 5C colleges. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2624.7s)]
*  Layla and Maria Riker are former students and great collaborators in support of Keith. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2627.42s)]
*  They're bringing us to—we'll be doing two concerts, April 17 and 18, at Scripps College. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2635.26s)]
*  One of those nights will be devoted to poetry, because as we all know and have heard, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2642.78s)]
*  Keith is quite a poet. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2648.38s)]
*  We'll be going up to Tufts in April as well. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2650.86s)]
*  Another student, Ilan, is bringing us there. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2655.1s)]
*  We'll be back at Northwestern University in March. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2657.58s)]
*  So we're kind of moving all around. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2660.94s)]
*  So often it is the young people whose lives Keith has touched who are going on and advocating for [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2663.9s)]
*  him. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2670.86s)]
*  So we're busy. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2671.1s)]
*  There'll be some concerts happening. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2671.98s)]
*  The ECPM is bringing us to Paris in October. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2674.46s)]
*  They are the organization that hosts the World Congress Against the Death Penalty, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2677.82s)]
*  and they do so much international support for people in very oppressive countries suffering [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2682.54s)]
*  terrible death row situations. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2689.66s)]
*  So they're going to be bringing us there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2692.86s)]
*  I'm probably forgetting something, but there'll be some concerts in Spain where Albert is—he's [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2695.98s)]
*  Catalan, so quite often we perform there. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2700.7799999999997s)]
*  So—and more to come. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2703.66s)]
*  So— [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2705.02s)]
*  You're talking about the jazz musician Albert Márquez. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2705.2599999999998s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Rp-MKjtgk&t=2709.98s)]
