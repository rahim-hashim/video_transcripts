We spend the hour with acclaimed historian Greg Grandin discussing his new book, America, América: A New History of the New World, which spans five centuries of North and South American history since the Spanish conquest, including the fight against fascism in the 1930s. He examines the U.S.-Latin American relationship under Trump, with a focus on El Salvador, Panama, Ecuador and Cuba. Grandin also has a new piece for The Intercept that draws on the book, headlined "The Long History of Lawlessness in U.S. Policy Toward Latin America." "If the United States really has given up its role as superintending a global liberal order and the world is reverting back to these kind of spheres of power competitions, then Latin America becomes, essentially, much more important," says Grandin. We also continue to examine the legacy of the late Pope Francis, the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina and the first pope from Latin America. Grandin shares how the Catholic Church's involvement in the conquest and colonization of the continent impacted the pope's beliefs.

# "America, América": Greg Grandin on Latin American History, from Colonization to CECOT to Pope

*  He describes this as a, quote, history of the modern world, an inquiry into how centuries [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=32.24s)]
*  of American bloodshed and diplomacy didn't just shape the political identities of the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=37.52s)]
*  United States and Latin America, but also gave rise to global governance, the liberal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=43.32s)]
*  international order that today many believe is in terminal crisis, unquote. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  The book spans five centuries, from the Spanish conquest to the first Latin American pope, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=55.28s)]
*  Francis, who was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and just happened to die [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=62.160000000000004s)]

*  Border Wall and the Mind of America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=96.96s)]
*  Professor Grandin, welcome back to Democracy Now! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=99.96s)]
*  Congratulations on the release of your book. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  I want to begin with that incredible moment in the White House, in the Oval Office. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  There is President Trump sitting next to the Salvadoran president, who calls himself a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=113.08s)]
*  dictator, Nayib Bukele. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=119.28s)]
*  And the moment of the United States and El Salvador, what this represented in the culmination [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=123.35999999999999s)]
*  of U.S.-Salvadoran relations, even going back, and I'm sure you're going to go back further, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=132.0s)]
*  to the 80s, when the U.S. supported the paramilitaries and the military in killing so many tens of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=138.16s)]
*  thousands of Salvadorans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  And now the relationship is around this notorious mega-prison, where President Trump says he [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  no longer has control over people he sends there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=152.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=157.08s)]
*  Well, what struck, a number of things struck me about that encounter in the White House. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=158.08s)]
*  One was, as you mentioned, Latin America is famous for the kind of form of political violence [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=163.6s)]
*  called political disappearance, in which people were literally just kidnapped off the street [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=171.64s)]
*  and disappeared by security forces. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=175.76s)]
*  And back then, an element of that kind of crime was the government would deny any knowledge [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=178.24s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=184.56s)]
*  And obviously that wasn't true. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=186.12s)]
*  The government and the security forces were deeply involved in carrying out and executing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  the disappearances. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=191.8s)]
*  But that deniability created another element of terror, the uncertainty, where their loved [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=192.8s)]
*  ones have gone, among the relatives, among the survivors, among the people who were taken. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=198.84s)]
*  You know, government officials, people would waste their time going through labyrinth, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=204.2s)]
*  bureaucracies, asking questions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=209.68s)]
*  And the government officials would say, who knows? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=211.56s)]
*  Maybe they went to Cuba. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=213.72s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=214.88s)]
*  And what struck me was Bukele is like, there was no deniability this time, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=216.16s)]
*  Trump and Bukele was like, we got them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=221.0s)]
*  We know where they are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=223.4s)]
*  And yeah, and we're not going to give them back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=224.76s)]
*  That kind of F-U impunity is a different kind of terror, a different scale, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=227.16s)]
*  The uncertainty of that first wave of disappearances created a kind of horror and suffering among [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=234.8s)]
*  people, this not this kind of performance of omnipotence. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  We have them and you can't do anything about it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=248.12s)]
*  I also was struck by the glee in which they talked about it, just the joking about it, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  like as if they were just talking about, you know, not even human beings, the dehumanization. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=260.16s)]
*  That was another thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=265.04s)]
*  And let me just also say, this is a little bit of a tangent, but Bukele does like to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=266.04s)]
*  look around with a little bit of irony, although it's not ironic at all because it's true that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=273.68s)]
*  he's a dictator. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  And you know, when FDR visited, Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited Vargas, the president in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Brazil, who was a dictator, but was also building a kind of social state. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  He was a back of social rights and expanding kind of social welfare to the working class. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=294.0s)]
*  And when Vargas and FDR met, there was a little protest against Vargas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=302.44s)]
*  Vargas whispers to Roosevelt, they call me a dictator, and Roosevelt whispered back, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=307.44s)]
*  me too. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=313.56s)]
*  And so they were joking about being dictators, but in a completely different circumstance [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=314.56s)]
*  in the sense that they're building social rights, they're building a social state, they're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  expanding economic, you know, welfare states and social rights to people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=324.12s)]
*  And so we hear what we have, two people talking about themselves as dictators and acting as [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=330.36s)]
*  dictators as they dismantle what's left of the New Deal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=335.44s)]
*  And Greg, of course, you're familiar, you've written in the past about this history of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=342.08s)]
*  lawlessness from the United States with regard to Latin America. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=347.28s)]
*  And it seems to me that just the same cavalier attitude that was evinced in this discussion [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=354.68s)]
*  in the White House has been pretty much part and parcel of U.S. policy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  We're facing now, for instance, Trump talking about taking back Panama. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, there are actually more U.S. troops now in Panama. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=371.8s)]
*  Quietly, the Panamanian government has allowed some of the old military bases to open up [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=376.04s)]
*  again as a result of the pressure from the Trump administration. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=381.72s)]
*  Yeah, and they'll soon be in Ecuador also. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  Ecuador is vying to be a second El Salvador in the sense of a kind of security outpost. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=387.92s)]
*  This is all in the context of, in a way of losing Colombia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=394.04s)]
*  I don't know if they've lost Colombia permanently, but a left-wing, Gustavo Petro, was elected [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  president and he was an old insurgent, and Colombia kind of no longer serving as a kind [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  of forecastle of U.S. power in the region, and the United States now constituting El [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=412.52s)]
*  Salvador and Ecuador as these kind of places in which they're projecting military power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=417.16s)]
*  I mean, the bigger question here is if the United States really has given up its role [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=422.64s)]
*  as superintending a global liberal order and the world is reverting back to these kind [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=428.04s)]
*  of spheres of power competitions, then Latin America will become centrally much more important [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=434.2s)]
*  to the United States as a source of resources, as a security perimeter in which being able [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=440.92s)]
*  to use certain countries as military bases becomes that much more important as the world [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=450.24s)]
*  kind of fragments up into, fragments into these spheres of influence, Russia and China [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=459.24s)]
*  and whatnot. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  And so we'll see a lot more of that, I think, in Latin America in the coming years. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=468.56s)]
*  I'm wondering, I wanted to ask you specifically about the role of Guantanamo, because most [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=473.08s)]
*  Americans don't really grasp the fact that the United States is holding a military base [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=484.04s)]
*  in Cuba really against the wishes of the Cuban government still after all of these years. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=489.56s)]
*  What allows this to continue to occur? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, what allows it to continue to occur is just absolute raw power, the power of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=497.72s)]
*  United States. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=501.68s)]
*  And the United States, when it took Cuba and it took Puerto Rico and the Philippines and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=502.68s)]
*  in 1898 in this war, Spanish war against Spain, it carved out Guantanamo as a military base, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=508.16s)]
*  as a calling station. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=516.64s)]
*  And it had an end date, and I think that end date passed for the least. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=520.0s)]
*  But once the Cuban Revolution happened in 1959, the U.S. ignored it and just kept Guantanamo [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=524.24s)]
*  as its own kind of enclave within the Revolutionary Island. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=532.88s)]
*  And of course, Latin America has long been a place in which the United States as a growing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  empire has used as a receptacle to cast off its unwanted or the people that are considered [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=543.5200000000001s)]
*  kind of outside the pale of belonging to the nation. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=551.72s)]
*  And in the way to the Civil War, many people thought that the United States could avert [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=557.0s)]
*  a war over slavery by basically sending all its free people of color to Latin America, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  to Central America, to Mexico, to Panama, to Haiti as a way of lessening racial tensions [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=566.8s)]
*  that of course didn't happen. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=577.52s)]
*  In the 1990s, Guantanamo became the place where the U.S. held refugee Haitians, the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=579.92s)]
*  following that country's coup against Aristide in human conditions. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  And then of course, during the war on terror, Guantanamo became synonymous with a war that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  legal categories could no longer kind of organize. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=605.4799999999999s)]
*  So there was no term for these prisoners who didn't belong to any, or we weren't fighting [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=611.32s)]
*  their nations, we were fighting them. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  So it came up with enemy combatants and Guantanamo became the place in which they were housed. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=619.96s)]
*  So there's a long history of this of course. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  And yes, it's on the island of Cuba and the irony of that, since Cuba is one of the few [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=628.2800000000001s)]
*  countries that have long resisted U.S. militarism. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  And I wanted to first of all congratulate you on your new book, America, America, and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=640.16s)]
*  also ask you why you felt that it was necessary to write this new history of the Western Hemisphere, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=646.04s)]
*  especially at this time. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=653.68s)]
*  Well, I thought there's a lot of books that look at the influence of Latin America in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=656.8s)]
*  the United States and El Norte and how the Americas are really all one. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=663.48s)]
*  But what I was really trying to do is go a little bit further and think about how the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=671.08s)]
*  tension between first the British and Spanish colonial system and then between Spanish Republicans [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=675.24s)]
*  and the United States gives rise to a set of political principles that become the foundation [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=682.6s)]
*  of the global order. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=691.0s)]
*  What people think of the founding of the United Nations or the founding of the League [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=693.12s)]
*  of Nations or what they talk about the rules-based order. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=696.8s)]
*  They often look to Europe, they look to Europe's relationship with its former colonies and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=701.04s)]
*  that's the histories that get written. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=707.32s)]
*  But in many ways, the ideas that become foundational to the world after the end of World War II [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=709.24s)]
*  were created in Latin America. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=716.24s)]
*  When you think about it, Juan, the United States becomes a nation, a single nation on [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=718.92s)]
*  what they imagine to be an empty continent. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=723.92s)]
*  Obviously it wasn't an empty continent. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=727.0s)]
*  Obviously the Spanish Empire, so there was indigenous sovereignty across the plains [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=729.16s)]
*  and across the Rockies and the United States revives the doctrine of conquest in order [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=735.16s)]
*  to justify moving west as fast as possible. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=740.88s)]
*  In order to justify moving west as fast as it can. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=743.9599999999999s)]
*  Latin America comes into the world, six republics already a League of Nations. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=748.24s)]
*  They come into the world already a United Nations. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=754.56s)]
*  They have to learn, there was nothing like that in history. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=757.8s)]
*  Europe wasn't like that. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Europe was a collection of empires and monarchies that were then expanding their colonial reach, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=762.52s)]
*  sending their gunboats into the Indian Ocean and flitting around China. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  Latin America was a true assemblage of bounded nations and they had to learn how to get along. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=777.56s)]
*  They both threatened each other and they both legitimated each other. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=786.0s)]
*  It legitimated each other because if one republic could throw off Spanish Catholicism and declare [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=790.0s)]
*  itself independent, then another one could. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=794.86s)]
*  But they threatened each other because under the old rules of law, what was to stop Argentina [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=797.88s)]
*  from doing what the United States was doing and said we want the Pacific. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=803.4s)]
*  Let's just send our settlers over across the mountains and start taking land from the Chileans [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=807.64s)]
*  or the Mapuche or whatever. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=813.64s)]
*  But of course they weren't going to do that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  They had to figure out a new theory of sovereignty, a new way of thinking about how nations live [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=817.32s)]
*  together. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=823.84s)]
*  One of the first things they came up with is the premise that nations aren't necessarily [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=825.0s)]
*  inherently competitive. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=830.04s)]
*  They critiqued both the United States' doctrine of conquest and they critiqued the old world's [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=832.64s)]
*  balance of power, the presumption that the way you achieve stability and stasis is by [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=838.64s)]
*  each nation or empire pressing their interests and that creates a kind of countervailing [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=845.36s)]
*  force. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=850.48s)]
*  They thought that was inherently unstable and would always lead to war. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=851.36s)]
*  What they came up with was a vision of internationalism in which the first principle was that nations [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=855.38s)]
*  shared a kind of common purpose, a shared set of interests, and that they could work [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=861.72s)]
*  together cooperatively through diplomacy. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=867.28s)]
*  They also came up with the idea that the boundaries of the old colonial system were the boundaries [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=870.44s)]
*  that they were going to accept. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  It may not be perfect. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=878.36s)]
*  They may have been imposed by the colonial system, but that's what we have. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=879.36s)]
*  There's no frontiers. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  We're not going to be pushing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  In many ways this was kind of an ideal type of vision. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  There was plenty of wars in Latin America, particularly in the 19th century, and skirmishes. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=891.6s)]
*  Brazil wanted rubber that was in Peru. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=897.12s)]
*  There was lots of border skirmishes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=901.96s)]
*  But all of those skirmishes were negotiated under the premise that the boundaries were [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=905.0s)]
*  real, that wars of conquest and wars of aggression were illegal. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=912.16s)]
*  And all of these ideas are what eventually makes it into the United Nations Charter. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=916.8399999999999s)]
*  Greg Rendon, I wanted to ask you, follow up on you mentioning Argentina and also follow [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=921.76s)]
*  up on the Pope, and it goes to a major theme in your book, Democracy Now! [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=928.28s)]
*  We've been on the broadcast from Buenos Aires for several days. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=932.9599999999999s)]
*  We follow the mothers of the disappeared in the Plaza de Mayo, and the women who lost [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=937.04s)]
*  their children and grandchildren demanding to know where they were. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=945.7199999999999s)]
*  And you follow the position of the Catholic Church throughout Latin America, of extremely [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  conservative force, but also the liberation theology that was so important and they were [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=958.88s)]
*  counter to each other, whether we're talking about the church allying with the U.S.-backed [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=966.2s)]
*  regimes in Guatemala and El Salvador. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=972.72s)]
*  In El Salvador, of course, Archbishop Romero was gunned down March 24, 1980. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=976.16s)]
*  Argentina, that is where Pope Francis was from, the first Latin American pope. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  He was there during the dirty war from 76 to 83. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=990.28s)]
*  And I know there's controversy around there. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=995.24s)]
*  It's quite murky what happened then and what his role was and his relation to liberation [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  theology at the time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1005.28s)]
*  Could you go into this? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1006.92s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1008.36s)]
*  Pope Francis, in many ways, was a quintessential Latin American. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1011.84s)]
*  He was born during an era in which social movements, labor unions, and peasant leagues [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1017.36s)]
*  were entering the public sphere, demanding social rights. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1025.64s)]
*  In his case, he grew up under Peronism. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1029.2s)]
*  I don't know his position on Peron. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1031.8s)]
*  I don't know whether his family was Peronist. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1034.8s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1036.44s)]
*  But he certainly was immersed in that kind of, you know, the bursting into the public [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1037.72s)]
*  sphere of the plebeian. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1044.68s)]
*  And he was a priest through the dirty war, as you said, and through all of the turmoil [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1048.44s)]
*  of the 1970s. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  And there is a murky period, and there's accusations and counter-accusations. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1057.0s)]
*  But it seems as if most of the forces of the left have—the question was whether he [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1062.84s)]
*  did enough to protect other Jesuits as the head of the Jesuit order in Argentina against [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1074.28s)]
*  the dictatorship. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1079.84s)]
*  Yeah, particularly the two priests. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1080.84s)]
*  Particularly two Jesuit priests. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1081.84s)]
*  And one, to his dying day, believed that Pope Francis gave him up. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1085.44s)]
*  Named for Saint Francis. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, named for Saint Francis. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1097.0800000000002s)]
*  And the other priest forgave and said, no, I believe he did all he could to protect us [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1099.0800000000002s)]
*  as much as he could. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1106.64s)]
*  He wasn't a liberation theologian. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1108.44s)]
*  In fact, many thought he was conservative. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1111.04s)]
*  There was some talk when he was voted pope that he was picked because he would serve [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1113.76s)]
*  as a counterforce to the political left, which at that time, if you remember, was Chávez [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1120.76s)]
*  and Kirchner in Argentina. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1127.16s)]
*  And it was a very strong movement in Latin America in the middle of the first decade [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1129.28s)]
*  of the 2000s. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1136.1200000000001s)]
*  But history has this way of doing the unexpected, and he turned out to be quite a humanist progressive [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1138.56s)]
*  pope, particularly when placed within the larger perspective of the religious schism [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1148.32s)]
*  between conservative Christianity, which is on the rise, in which there's alliances between [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  conservative Catholics and dominionist evangelicals that want to basically take over the world. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1161.24s)]
*  They want to take over the political sphere and seem to be doing a pretty good job of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1168.52s)]
*  it in this country and elsewhere. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1172.36s)]
*  And that wing of the Catholic Church that still imagines itself as emancipationist, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1174.56s)]
*  as liberationist, as egalitarian. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1180.32s)]
*  And he obviously sided with that wing, with the liberationist wing in his pronouncements, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1183.04s)]
*  in his very being. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1189.8s)]
*  His last act was calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, which the New York Times didn't bother [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1191.92s)]
*  with the dimension in its obituary, which is interesting. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  And which itself... [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1201.96s)]
*  Sunday, on Easter day. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1202.96s)]
*  Yeah, which was amazing. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1204.2s)]
*  So it was the same thing with Oscar Romero. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1206.96s)]
*  When Oscar Romero was picked to be bishop of El Salvador, he was picked because they [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1209.76s)]
*  thought he was conservative. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1213.8s)]
*  They thought he would defend the status quo. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1214.96s)]
*  The landed class was very happy with Oscar Romero. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1219.96s)]
*  And the experience of living in history has the tendency to radicalize people sometimes. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1223.2s)]
*  And sometimes it radicalizes them in the right direction, in the more humanist direction. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1231.4s)]
*  And that happened with Oscar Romero, and it happened, I think, with Francis. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1235.52s)]
*  And he dies right before giving that speech, which is broadcast throughout El Salvador, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1239.2s)]
*  Archbishop Romero, directly addressing the Salvadoran military. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  Sadly, the U.S. backs Salvadoran military, saying, I urge you, I beseech you, I demand [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1250.68s)]
*  you put down your arms. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1256.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's quite a heresy, right, to order your military not to obey their officers? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  Greg, I wanted to ask you this. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1265.1200000000001s)]
*  This debate between the humanists and elitists and conservative wings of the Catholic Church, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1268.8s)]
*  as you note in your book, has a long history. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1274.4s)]
*  You spent quite a bit of time talking about the 16th century debates between two Dominican [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1279.32s)]
*  priests, Bartel Omeo de las Casas and Francisco de Victoria. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1288.16s)]
*  What was the substance of that debate, and what's its importance historically, especially [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1293.68s)]
*  in terms of the impact that the Native presence on America had on European thought? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1298.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1304.16s)]
*  Well, the book does start with the conquest, and it starts with the conquest and all of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1305.16s)]
*  its horror and all of its suffering. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1308.84s)]
*  I mean, we're talking, some demographers call it the greatest human mortality event in history. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1311.48s)]
*  They estimate that there were probably about 90 million people living in the Americas, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  and within a century, 90 percent of them were gone. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1325.04s)]
*  And Spanish Catholicism, when the Spanish Empire arrived and claimed dominion, claimed [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1329.56s)]
*  sovereignty, they knew they were presiding over a populated land, and it sparked a debate [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1339.44s)]
*  among the theologians about how to justify dominion. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  The reconquest of Iberia, the driving Muslims and Islam off of Iberia was justifiable because [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1351.52s)]
*  Spain, Spain, Spain, yes, Iberia, Spain, was justified because they claimed that Spain [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1359.32s)]
*  was Christian before Muslim Islam arrived, and therefore what they were doing was just [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1366.36s)]
*  taking back land that had been taken from them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1371.36s)]
*  But they couldn't make that argument in the conquest, right, because Native Americans [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1374.54s)]
*  hadn't known Christ, and therefore they couldn't deny Christ. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1380.56s)]
*  And so they had to come up with a new justification for why Spain had the right to presume sovereignty [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1384.9399999999998s)]
*  over the Americas. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1392.9799999999998s)]
*  And there was a small group of critics, including de las Casas, including Francisco Vitoria, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1395.4599999999998s)]
*  most of them were Dominicans, also Franciscans, that began to argue that you couldn't find [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1402.3s)]
*  any basis of legitimacy. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1408.82s)]
*  They certainly had no legitimacy to enslave them. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1410.46s)]
*  And they're emerged in the face of the horror of the conquest and all its unimaginable suffering. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1414.5s)]
*  There emerged a critique, a quite cohesive critique, against conquest, against slavery, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1421.14s)]
*  a critique that almost went to the point of pacifism, and a critique that insisted that [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1429.74s)]
*  all humanity was one. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1434.54s)]
*  Bartolomé de las Casas is famous for a line, all humanity is one. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1436.38s)]
*  The actual correct English translation was something, or the whole human lineage is one, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1442.1000000000001s)]
*  meaning lineage from admin leave. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1447.5800000000002s)]
*  But he insisted on the equality of people. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1449.8600000000001s)]
*  There was no difference between Native Americans and Europeans in his mind. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1452.44s)]
*  And this is the foundation, I argue, of modern political thought, and particularly his rejection [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1457.7s)]
*  of the doctrine of conquest. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1464.4s)]
*  Why that's important, and I kind of trace that out through the book, and this by no [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1466.66s)]
*  means does it ameliorate any of the brutality of the conquistadores and what they did, and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1471.5s)]
*  the enslavement of Native Americans and that greatest human mortality event in human history [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1481.74s)]
*  that I mentioned earlier. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1487.54s)]
*  But it did create and consolidate a poll within the Catholic Church that continued, an emancipationist, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1490.06s)]
*  abolitionist poll that continued. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1498.46s)]
*  And why it's important, it's important for a couple of reasons. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1501.5s)]
*  One is it was important for the nature of the Spanish-American, Spanish empire within [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1504.3s)]
*  the Americas, which I can come back to. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1510.82s)]
*  But later on, when Spanish-American Republicans begin to break from Spain and set up their [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1514.22s)]
*  own independent nations, and then have to start contending with the United States, which [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1520.5400000000002s)]
*  is reviving the doctrine of conquest to justify its expansion west, these Latin American intellectuals [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1527.1000000000001s)]
*  and political leaders had already at their disposal a fairly coherent critique of conquest, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1535.2s)]
*  a fairly coherent critique of slavery, that they then, that what had been applied to Spain, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1542.02s)]
*  they then applied to the United States. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1547.38s)]
*  And it's that tension and it's that kind of persistence of this ethic that becomes the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1549.8600000000001s)]
*  foundation of the international order. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1556.54s)]
*  Now, I'll also say the other thing that's specific about the Spanish empire is that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1559.02s)]
*  the Spanish empire made no, the Spanish empire knew it was an empire over people. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1563.66s)]
*  Native Americans were the main thing. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1569.6200000000001s)]
*  They were the people who extracted the wealth out of the Americas and created the world's [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1572.3799999999999s)]
*  first universal currency. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1577.02s)]
*  But they were also the center of Spanish moralism. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1579.1s)]
*  They were, you know, what the Native Americans were, as they were defined by theology, is [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1581.6599999999999s)]
*  what justified the Spanish empire. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1586.94s)]
*  Now, when you jump ahead a couple of centuries and you get to British colonialism, there's [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1589.3799999999999s)]
*  no discussion about Native Americans. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1595.86s)]
*  There's no discussion about, you know, the justification of how to justify colonialism. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1598.42s)]
*  In fact, the London Company in 1607, when they were sitting around, they had a meeting [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1603.7s)]
*  and they said, well, maybe we should, maybe we should issue a document that justifies [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1609.38s)]
*  James Down and justifies, you know, what we want to do in New England. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  And you know, when I have this debate and fully aware that for a century the Spanish [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1621.06s)]
*  have been debating this for a year, for a century, and they basically come to the conclusion, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1626.3s)]
*  you know, the Spanish priests, the Dominicans and the theologians have been debating this [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1630.94s)]
*  for a century and they still can't come up with a workable justification for Spanish [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1637.6200000000001s)]
*  conquest. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1642.3400000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's better we don't say anything at all. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1643.3400000000001s)]
*  We just keep our mouths quiet and just do it. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1645.8200000000002s)]
*  So that evasion of responsibility is a major strut in the book. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1648.14s)]
*  We're going to break and then come back to this discussion. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1654.1s)]
*  I want to talk about the role of Latin America in fighting fascism from the 30s until now. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1656.1399999999999s)]
*  And also, I want to ask you about the radical journalist Ernest Groening. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1662.6599999999999s)]

*  Professor Greg Grandin is our guest. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1695.34s)]
*  So let's talk. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1698.8999999999999s)]
*  We talk about, oh, Urbán and Hungary. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1699.8999999999999s)]
*  We talk about Holocaust. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1702.3799999999999s)]
*  We talk about those who fought fascism. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1704.1799999999998s)]
*  But it isn't as much talked about. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1707.1399999999999s)]
*  Those who fought fascism in Latin America and its key role and what the United States [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1709.78s)]
*  and especially those who are fighting the authoritarian tendency can learn from our [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1715.14s)]
*  southern neighbor. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1720.26s)]
*  Well, Latin America had the good fortune of getting to fight fascism just as the New Deal [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1721.26s)]
*  was consolidating in the United States and a shift in the way—away from intervention [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1726.58s)]
*  and a shift away from Washington defending U.S. capitalists and U.S. investment at all [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1731.82s)]
*  So FDR had a much more eclectic approach to Latin America. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1738.14s)]
*  And basically, he gave the left room to maneuver in Latin America. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1742.5s)]
*  I mean, Spain, in many ways, a lot of grand strategists were afraid that basically the [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1748.0600000000002s)]
*  Spanish—the kind of conflict that you saw in Spain between a kind—Franco representing [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1755.0600000000002s)]
*  a Spanish nationalism, Catholic nationalism allied with Mussolini, allied with Hitler, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1762.4199999999998s)]
*  and fighting a kind of the more liberal currents within—with liberal and radical currents [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1769.1799999999998s)]
*  within Spain was basically just a preview of what—of a conflict that would eventually [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1774.58s)]
*  drift across the Atlantic and take over all of Latin America. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1780.58s)]
*  I mean, the sociology was very similar. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1783.86s)]
*  Surveil, peasants, large-landed landowners, you know, militarism, a kind of conservative [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1786.62s)]
*  Catholic hierarchy. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1794.4199999999998s)]
*  Many people saw in the Mexican Revolution a kind of mirror of the Spanish Civil War. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1796.6999999999998s)]
*  And many theorists felt Latin America could go either way. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1801.82s)]
*  And this isn't even talking about the influence of Germany and Japan and Italy within Latin [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1806.1799999999998s)]
*  America. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1814.4599999999998s)]
*  Latin America was really on a knife's edge in the 1930s. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  And the New Deal, basically, and particularly the left-wing members of the New Deal who [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1819.02s)]
*  were very much interested in Latin America, worked very hard to give space to social Democrats [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1826.5s)]
*  and create a kind of really bulked liberalism to a robust conception of social rights and [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1833.1000000000001s)]
*  material improvement in people's lives as a way of countering fascism. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1840.1s)]
*  Like, they didn't beat fascists just by calling them fascists. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1847.1s)]
*  They beat fascism by offering an alternative. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1849.3799999999999s)]
*  And that alternative was some form of socialism or some form of social democracy or some form [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1852.8999999999999s)]
*  of social liberalism. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1857.8999999999999s)]
*  And in one country after another, this kind of, you know, this kind of, you know, this [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1860.1399999999999s)]
*  kind of variations on social democracy come to power and ally with the United States. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1867.74s)]
*  And by the time the war starts, Latin America is pretty much, with the kind of exception [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1877.22s)]
*  of Argentina, is pretty much allied with the United States behind Washington. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1883.0200000000002s)]
*  So when FDR went to war in 1941, he rallied not just his nation, he rallied the whole [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1888.7800000000002s)]
*  hemisphere. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1895.82s)]
*  And Latin America was indispensable to the United States. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1898.1399999999999s)]
*  The United States didn't have to fight one battle for resources because it had Latin [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1900.86s)]
*  America. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1905.18s)]
*  And then Brazil, with that bulge that goes into the Atlantic, was a major transport route [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1906.34s)]
*  that, you know, Roosevelt called it the Atlantic trampoline because the planes would land in [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1912.3s)]
*  Natal and then go straight off and then go bounce over to North Africa. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1920.22s)]
*  And an amazing amount of war material made it to Europe through that route. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1925.18s)]
*  So Latin America in many ways, both materially and ideologically, was key to fighting fascism, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1930.54s)]
*  both as part of the war but then internally fighting the fascists within their own countries. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1937.18s)]
*  But, Greg, there were, as you mentioned, you mentioned Argentina. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1944.22s)]
*  Clearly Juan Perón's era was one that was least sympathetic to the Nazis. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1948.9s)]
*  And also the Trujillo dictatorship had a lot of sympathies for, certainly for Franco and [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1956.1000000000001s)]
*  for fascism. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1965.8600000000001s)]
*  Trujillo at one point had the assassination of a Spanish Republican, Galindez, the infamous [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1966.74s)]
*  Galindez case. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1974.1s)]
*  He was assassinated at Trujillo's orders in the United States. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1975.98s)]
*  So there was a current, a fascist current that eventually led to many Nazis settling [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1979.7s)]
*  in places like Argentina and Brazil after the war. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1985.3s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1989.18s)]
*  And that's what I mentioned, that in many ways people, the fear was that all of Latin [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1990.18s)]
*  America would become Spain, that there would be a Spanish civil war throughout the whole [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=1995.02s)]
*  of Latin America between the forces of progress and the forces of fascism. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2000.9399999999998s)]
*  And that didn't happen. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2005.3799999999999s)]
*  And in many places, because Democrats and Social Democrats came to power, in other places [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2007.6999999999998s)]
*  like the Dominican Republic and Trujillo is because they saw which way the winds were [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2015.6599999999999s)]
*  blowing and they got on board with the allies. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2018.86s)]
*  And then after the war, as you said, it does become kind of, in some ways, a continuation [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2022.54s)]
*  of World War II. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2030.54s)]
*  Many Socialists thought that the fight against fascism didn't end with the dropping of the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2032.62s)]
*  atomic bomb or European victory over Germany. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2038.26s)]
*  That now that the fascists were defeated in Europe, the fascists at home had to be defeated. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2043.26s)]
*  The Trujillos, the Samosas, the Batistas. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2050.58s)]
*  In the Caribbean, they created the Caribbean Legion, which they saw in, you know, they [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2055.94s)]
*  didn't see it as like looking ahead towards the Cold War. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2062.1400000000003s)]
*  They saw it as a continuation of World War II, that we're going to build a Caribbean [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2065.9s)]
*  Legion and we're going to take out Trujillo, we're going to take out Samosas, we're going [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2069.7400000000002s)]
*  to take out Batista and all the little Hitlers that are still kind of, you know, populating [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2072.78s)]
*  Latin America. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2079.78s)]
*  And of course that didn't happen. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2080.78s)]
*  What happened was that the Cold War shifted the terms of debate and the United States [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2082.82s)]
*  shifted its support away from Social Democrats and the idea that democracy and development [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2088.46s)]
*  went hand in hand towards an idea that order and stability and development went hand in [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2095.46s)]
*  hand and began shifting all of its surveillance activities away from fascists and towards [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2102.82s)]
*  communists and towards the left. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2110.2200000000003s)]
*  And of course the irony is that during World War II, the United States invested all of [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2114.78s)]
*  these countries with enormous capacity, military capacity. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  There was a Latin lease program in Latin America where Chile got military equipment and Brazil [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2123.2200000000003s)]
*  got military equipment and after the war, those weapons were turned on the left. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2129.02s)]
*  There's no better example of this than in Chile in 1948. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2133.94s)]
*  Chile, a Popular Front government was elected in 1947, but then there was a militant strike [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2139.74s)]
*  in 1948, a miners' strike in 1948, and the government turned from the kind of ethos of [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2144.82s)]
*  the Popular Front to putting down the miners' strike and basically mobilizing airplanes [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2152.94s)]
*  and military warships to destroy and occupy large portions of northern Chile. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2160.2s)]
*  And involved in that was a young military officer named Augusto Pinochet who began rounding [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2167.72s)]
*  up strikers and putting them in a prison camp in northern Chile. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2172.9199999999996s)]
*  So you see how all of this military weaponry that was, so the line between fighting and [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2178.72s)]
*  facilitating fascism in Latin America was always very fungible. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2184.2s)]
*  And Greg, we have only a minute or two left, but I wanted to ask you about the Latinization [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2189.6s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2194.6s)]
*  There's over 62 million people of Latin American descent living in the United States today. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2196.8s)]
*  How much is this presence a part of the history that you write about? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2204.32s)]
*  Well, the book was long enough, so I couldn't go too far into the migration question, but [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2208.36s)]
*  certainly, and they bring with them the same kind of polarization, same kind of conflicts. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2215.92s)]
*  They revitalized union movements in Nevada and Los Angeles. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  When Latin Americans, they come to the United States, they don't think that democracy means [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2229.84s)]
*  just individual rights. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2235.16s)]
*  They believe in things like healthcare. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2236.58s)]
*  They believe in things like public education. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2238.4s)]
*  But then on the other hand, there's also a group of immigrants that come fleeing countries [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2241.04s)]
*  that they consider have gone too far to the left, and they've created their headquarters [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2248.12s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2252.68s)]
*  What we thought was the waning influence of older generations of right-wing Cubans has [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2255.08s)]
*  been reinvigorated by waves of Hondurans and Venezuelans that imagine themselves fleeing [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2260.6s)]
*  left-wing tyrants, Nicaraguans. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2269.36s)]
*  And so it's contributed to the turning of Florida into this laboratory of Trumpism and [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2273.52s)]
*  headquarters of a kind, Mar-a-Lago as a kind of headquarters of a pan-American Trumpism, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2281.4s)]
*  pan-hemisphere Trumpism. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2287.6s)]
*  What shocked you most in researching this, oh, 700-page epic work? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2289.44s)]
*  Oh, well, I guess what shocked me most, what I was so surprised with was how the Good Neighbor, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2297.24s)]
*  we know the Good Neighbor policy as a phrase associated with Franklin Roosevelt as his [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2305.04s)]
*  treatment of Latin America, but it was also the phrase that they used to get out the vote [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  in his 1936 reelection. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2318.3999999999996s)]
*  And it became a kind, the Good Neighbor leagues were set up as a counter to the Liberty Leagues, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2321.3199999999997s)]
*  explicitly anti-fascist. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2326.6s)]
*  They were meant to embody a certain kind of cultural pluralism and acceptance of the diversity [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2328.8999999999996s)]
*  of the nation. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2334.6s)]
*  And they were understood explicitly as an alternative to the white supremacist Liberty [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2335.9199999999996s)]
*  Leagues. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2341.56s)]
*  And they basically delivered the vote to Roosevelt. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2342.9199999999996s)]
*  He won 20 million votes. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2346.2799999999997s)]
*  He won more votes than any other human being in history up until that point, and he did [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2348.04s)]
*  so running on a policy of social democracy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6cPoNuEv0U&t=2354.4399999999996s)]
