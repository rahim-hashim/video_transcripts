# Dismantle the Commonwealth: Queen Elizabeth's Death Prompts Reckoning with Colonial Past in Africa
**Democracy Now!:** [September 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Z3Ob07Tyg)
*  As the world marks the death of Queen Elizabeth II, we begin today's show looking at how
*  she had many subjects throughout the former British Empire, and not all are mourning her
*  death equally.
*  Buckingham Palace has announced the state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II will take place
*  at Westminster Abbey on September 19th.
*  The queen's body will lie in state at the Houses of Parliament beginning on Wednesday.
*  On Friday, King Charles III gave his first public remarks since assuming the throne following
*  the death of his mother.
*  In taking up these responsibilities, I shall strive to follow the inspiring example I have
*  been set in upholding constitutional government and to seek the peace, harmony and prosperity
*  of the peoples of these islands and of the commonwealth realms and territories throughout
*  the world.
*  Over the weekend, at least two people were arrested in Britain for publicly criticizing
*  the monarchy.
*  The activist Simon Hill said he was arrested in Oxford after yelling out, quote, who elected
*  him during a ceremony honoring King Charles III.
*  For more on British colonial violence and its legacy, we're joined by two guests.
*  Caroline Elkins is professor of African and African-American history at Harvard University.
*  Her most recent book is titled Legacy of Violence, a History of the British Empire.
*  She was awarded the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction for her first book, Imperial
*  Reckoning, the Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya.
*  Her research into Britain's brutal suppression of the Mao Mao movement in Kenya in the 50s
*  resulted in a court case and helped lead to the awarding of reparations to more than
*  5,200 surviving Kenyans who were subjected to systematic torture and abuse under British
*  rule.
*  Also with us, Mukamao Wangugi, associate professor of Literatures in English at Cornell University.
*  His most recent book is titled Unbury Our Dead with Song.
*  He's the co-founder of the Saffo Cornell Kiswahili Prize for African Writing.
*  In 2020, he was part of the initiative at Cornell to change the department's name
*  from Department of English to Literatures in English.
*  He's the son of the world-renowned Kenyan author Ngugiwa Tiango.
*  After Queen Elizabeth died, our guest wrote,
*  My uncle was deaf.
*  He was asked by British soldiers to stop.
*  Of course he did not hear them.
*  They shot him dead.
*  My other uncle was in the Mao Mao.
*  My grandmother hid bullets for him.
*  Colonialism happened to real people.
*  It's absolute madness to expect us to mourn the Queen.
*  Professor Mukamao Wangugi and Caroline Elkins, we welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  Professor Ngugi, let's begin with you.
*  Your response to the death of the queen, the monarch who reigned for 70 years, and
*  what she meant for Africa and specifically your country, Kenya?
*  Yeah, so, what I've been thinking about over the last few days is how my family got
*  affected, right?
*  Got affected by British colonialism, right?
*  In my tweet, I mentioned about my uncle, you know, who was deaf.
*  He couldn't hear the soldiers, you know, the British soldiers, so they shot him.
*  And also my other uncle, who was in the Mao Mao, you know, the Kenyan London Freedom
*  Army.
*  But what's become interesting to me now is the intimacy of colonialism, right?
*  Because I was talking with my father the other day, and he told me this story about how we
*  also had a home guard, a loyalist, you know, a family, right?
*  His brother, one of his brothers was a loyalist, the other one was in the Mao Mao.
*  And how, at some point, you know, they went to my grandmother's place at the same time,
*  you know, and they both ran away, right?
*  In my own case, my name Mukamao.
*  I'm named after a chief, who was called Mukamao, of course, yeah, who was forced off
*  land in this really beautiful place called Tigoni.
*  And he and his people then were forced off the land and taken to a very, very arid area,
*  right?
*  So I think what I want people to think about is that these questions of colonialism, they
*  happen to real people, right?
*  Like there is no—yeah, it happened to real people.
*  If you could share for our audience, our audience in the United States and around the world,
*  who aren't familiar with Kenya's history, going back in time and back to the British
*  colonial time when it became a colony, Kenya's independence and who the Mao Mao were.
*  Yeah, so the Mao Mao were—people call it a rebellion, but really we should call it
*  a revolution, right?
*  You know, so we should say they were revolutionaries.
*  But OK, British colonialism was brutal.
*  There's no other way of putting it, right?
*  And then when the Kenyans started resisting, the British government declared a state of
*  emergency, in which case then a lot of Kenyans were taken into detention camps.
*  In fact, the school I went to called Genya, we also called it Manyani because it was a
*  former concentration camp, right?
*  So it was very, very brutal.
*  The resistance itself, we don't give it enough historical breadth, right?
*  Because a lot of people talk about it as a Koyo affair or, you know, like a very narrow
*  movement.
*  But it actually involved the whole Kenyan society.
*  So you have Kenyan Indians who are supporting the Mao Mao, different ethnicities and so
*  on and so forth.
*  For the audience in the United States, I would say a Quotina writer who wrote so many hangers,
*  right?
*  You can't have oppression without resistance.
*  Yeah, so we had the resistance.
*  Come independence, the betrayal happened, right?
*  So OK, there were factions within the independence movement.
*  So the betrayal happened where you ended up with a president who actually at some point—this
*  is Jomo Kenyatta, who at some point called the Mao Mao terrorists, right?
*  But I want to mention a bit of irony here, that in Kenya now we are mourning.
*  There is a four-day—the current president declared a four-day mourning period for the
*  queen.
*  But his father, Jomo Kenyatta, he himself was actually jailed and detained by the British,
*  right?
*  So I think there are two levels here.
*  One is governmental responses or the larger structural political issues.
*  But then the other level is what people are saying themselves, right?
*  So yes, so we have a new colonial government, if you—just to put it bluntly, right?
*  That's not respecting the wishes of the majority of Kenyans, you know, who were affected
*  by British colonialism.
*  I mean, the queen had a special relationship with Kenya.
*  Not only, though, it is interesting that she learned of her own father's death, which
*  led to her ascension as queen, when she was visiting Kenya.
*  The significance of this, Professor Ngooghee?
*  Yeah, so it's one of the ironies, historical ironies, right, that she became queen of Kenya.
*  But at the same time when the repression against Kenyans was actually becoming, you know, was
*  becoming not just visible, but also vicious, you know, detention camps, murders, one-ton
*  shootings and so on and so forth.
*  There's an obsession, I think, within the monarchy, right, of having these territories.
*  You know, in the headlines, King Charles—you quoted King Charles, right, where he was saying
*  that, you know, that we have realms, territories and so on and so forth.
*  But there is—I don't know, for me, I think it's a degree of psychosis, right, that
*  You can go to another people's land, right, colonize them, you know, and then expect them
*  to honor you at the same time, right?
*  The fact that Kenya has entered four days of mourning for the queen actually captures
*  that whole absurdity, right?
*  Yeah, I don't know, like, there's a part of me that finds all this so—like, so I
*  don't know, silly, to put it that way, right?
*  Like, so, you know, yeah, so the queen became the queen in Kenya.
*  At the same time, there were murders, assassinations, you know, and just good old-fashioned corruption
*  and so on and so forth, right?
*  And then at the same time, we expected to mourn, you know, to mourn the queen.
*  Yeah.
*  I wanted to bring Professor Caroline Elkins into this conversation, your colleague at
*  Harvard with the African and African-American History Department, author of Legacy of Violence,
*  A History of the British Empire.
*  You won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for your book, Imperial Reckoning, the Untold Story of Britain's
*  Gulag in Kenya.
*  Tell us that story and how—I mean, most of, of course, the reason that the reparations
*  went to so many Kenyans, thousands of them, was because of their activism, but because
*  of your book, as well.
*  Well, thank you so much for having me today.
*  You know, I think a few things here.
*  First of all, the book itself, Imperial Reckoning, really picked up on where—what the literature,
*  and I mean, literature told us.
*  Nkomo's father, Ngugiwante Yonko, had written about this in literary form.
*  Humanists are often one or two steps at least ahead of historians.
*  But I was determined to tell the full story of these detention camps that were set up
*  on a massive scale.
*  Nearly 1.5 million Kikuyu, or Africans, were detained in detention camps or emergency villages,
*  barbed wire villages, as a way of suppressing Mau Mau.
*  These documents were then—they denied at the time, first under Churchill and then his
*  successors and finally McMillan, they denied any wrongdoing.
*  And when allegations did surface that had some credibility, they explained it as the
*  fault of a one-off, so-called bad apples.
*  Instead, what we find is that when you piece this story back together again, that this
*  was a story about systematic violence, torture, murder, and massive cover-up.
*  And the bottom line is that serious crimes happened on the Queen's Imperial watch.
*  In fact, her picture hung in every detention camp in Kenya as detainees were beaten in
*  order to exact their loyalty to the British Crown.
*  And the question that remains now that I think we're debating in some ways is how much did
*  she know and what did knowing mean, number one, and how do we reconcile this moment in
*  time, particularly in Kenya, around her death?
*  And I think it's here where, one, I think, first of all, we should honor those individuals,
*  those whose families experienced this and Komo's and others, to choose not to mourn.
*  And certainly based on the history we know, it is their decision to do so and absolutely
*  within their right to do so and quite justifiable.
*  At the same time, what I find very interesting is getting back to Komo's point about current
*  President Kenyan and frankly many others.
*  When this case happened at the High Court of London, five claimants, initially test
*  claimants, sued the British government for systematic torture and violence in detention
*  camps in Kenya in the 1950s.
*  And four years later, the British government settled the case, as you noted in your remarks.
*  But for each of those five claimants that came to London, they each believed that they
*  were appealing not to the British government, but to the Queen.
*  The person they wanted to see most was the Queen.
*  And one of them, Wambuki Waningi, said in his statement, and I quote my recent book,
*  if I could speak to the Queen, this is what I would tell her.
*  And he says that under her watch, British government tortured her, but that he did not
*  hold her personally responsible.
*  And so when I step back and look at this, what I see is some of her power is not only
*  that the extraction of wealth and land and the rest, but the fact that she herself, as
*  her predecessors did, wrapped herself in empire, deflected from what was being carried out
*  in her name, and beckoned colonial subjects like Wambugu to revere her.
*  And to this day, many still do.
*  And in some ways, that's how we can explain how governments like the current one in Kenya
*  are calling for four days of national mourning.
*  Can you talk more extensively about the Maomao rebellion, what Professor Ngugi called really
*  a revolution, and what the British did to them in Kenya?
*  Absolutely.
*  A hugely important question, right?
*  Because I think the Maomao, in a nutshell, was an anti-colonial and a civil war.
*  It was anti-colonial in that it was those who joined the movement and they took an oath
*  of allegiance and nearly 1.5 million Kikuyu, the British government estimated at 90%, took
*  what was considered the first oath of allegiance to the movement.
*  So this was a massive movement and they were demanding ethaq and awiyathe, or land and
*  freedom, from the British government.
*  And as a way to suppress that, the British government rounded up and detained nearly
*  all of them, nearly 1.5 million.
*  It was also a guerrilla war, about 20 or 30,000 fled to the forest, and there was a classic,
*  if you will, sort of military action within this.
*  But the British government gained the initiative over the forest war, as it's called, within
*  two years of the war, right?
*  So from 1952 to 1954.
*  But the state of emergency that had been declared extends from 1954 to 1960.
*  And it's during that period of time, that's the period of time that I largely focused on in
*  imperial reckoning.
*  It's during that period of time where they exacted extraordinary torture, forced labor,
*  punishment, starvation, in order to get the detainees and those who were detained in emergency
*  villages to renounce their allegiance to Mao Mao, to adopt their allegiance back to the
*  British and to the Crown and to Her Majesty, in order to be released from the camps and
*  to become, as they considered themselves, to be, quote unquote, the British civilized
*  subjects.
*  And so that's at the heart of both Mao Mao, what they were demanding, and the British
*  government.
*  Ultimately, the British government, it becomes a war of attrition.
*  The British government ultimately decides to decolonize or leave Kenya in 1963 after it
*  is caught red-handed in 1959 with what's called the Hola massacre, where 11 detainees were
*  beaten to death in Hola detention camp.
*  And what's different about this, it wasn't an exceptional moment, but what's different about
*  this is they get caught red-handed and they can't explain it away.
*  There's a huge uproar in Parliament about this.
*  It is explained to the Queen by then-Prime Minister Harold McMillan that this was an
*  unfortunate incident based upon the actions of quite minor officials, when in fact, of
*  course, we know now as historians, which I sort of exposed within Imperial Reckoning,
*  that this was the long—that the end of a long pattern, six years of brutal torture,
*  murder and starvation tactics, along with forced labor, in these camps in Kenya.
*  So, when we look at the cost of the funeral alone, India's Economic Times says the funeral
*  is expected to cost £6 billion, not to mention the expenditures of the royal family over
*  these decades.
*  How much of that money comes from the pain and suffering of the people of Kenya?
*  What were the resources in Kenya?
*  Of course, most importantly, human resources.
*  But what was Britain extracting from Kenya?
*  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
*  Yeah, I think—look, this is an enormous question you touched on, Amy, and one that
*  we're not going to settle in the context of our few minutes here, but I can tell you
*  this.
*  The British government, the moment the Queen ascended in February of 1952, the British
*  government was reeling from the postwar effects and its economy was in tatters.
*  It decides that it is going to rebuild its economy and its position as part of the big
*  three on the international global stage, on the backs of its colonized people, through
*  a policy called imperial resurgence.
*  And Kenya becomes an incredibly important part of this, with its tea and coffee export
*  economy, because Britain needed this money within its monetary policy.
*  We don't need to get into the details of that.
*  They needed this in order to bolster the pound sterling, pay back loans from the war, and
*  rebuild its economy.
*  So, there's no question whatsoever—I think I'm answering your question in a slightly
*  different way—but there's no question that during Queen Victoria's reign, Kenya would
*  be one example, Malaya with its rubber exports, Ghana with its cocoa, that her government,
*  her nation rebuilt itself on the backs of empire.
*  And that I think we're fairly unequivocal about.
*  So, the question becomes today, and getting back to some of the Comalys points, it's not
*  just the mourning, but it's thinking about who is—and you be guaranteed this funeral
*  like every single royal occasion, frankly, since Queen Victoria in the 19th century,
*  and certainly under Queen Elizabeth, every royal occasion is an imperial one.
*  So not only will they be spending money, in some ways, in sort of an elliptical manner
*  that comes from empire over the years, but they will also be holding out the symbols,
*  the signs, the images of empire through medals and statues and the like, reinforcing imperial
*  greatness.
*  And that imperial greatness is inextricably linked to Britain's monarchy.
*  Do you see reparations being a very real now and prominent issue as the queen dies and
*  Charles becomes king?
*  Unquestionably.
*  Look, I think that, you know, a few things.
*  I think these have—there was the case that you gestured to, the Malmau case, which I
*  was involved in as an expert witness.
*  But particularly in recent years, the King Charles III and the royal family have become
*  well aware of global demands for a kind of global British imperial reckoning, if you
*  upon the protests, based upon the petitions from formerly colonized people and those still
*  living in Commonwealth realms.
*  It is unquestionable as well.
*  We can debate all we want how much the queen knew at the time about what was going on.
*  There is no debate whatsoever that this current king has the knowledge that serious crimes
*  happened on his mother's imperial watch.
*  And it's up to him at this point to jettison in some ways the tradition that his mother
*  held so dear, revise and going back to the speech that you played early in our program,
*  where he also speaks to Britain's unique history of imperial—and quote, unquote,
*  unique history, and I would add, of imperial benevolence that she cultivated in a firm
*  for 70 years.
*  And he has to reconcile with that.
*  He has to speak to these questions of reparations.
*  The alternative is to simply carry on, and that's only going to hasten the monarch's
*  demise.
*  And that I feel fairly confident in saying.
*  Professor Mukoma Wangugi, we give you the final word.
*  What do you demand now that Prince Charles has become King Charles III?
*  I—so, what I would like to see is the dismantling of this notion of the Commonwealth, right?
*  I was thinking about the name earlier, from a right-wing perspective, Commonwealth, whose
*  wealth?
*  But the way I've been thinking about all these issues is actually through slavery,
*  right?
*  So, the book I'm working on, or I'm working on now on Africans and African Americans,
*  took me to Keta in Ghana, right?
*  Keta is where slaves were being taken from, right?
*  And it's a very depressed—you know, the aftershocks, if you want to call it that,
*  or the trauma of slavery still, it's evident, right?
*  It's poor, depressed, and so on and so forth.
*  My angel called it melancholic, actually, right?
*  Then from there, I left Keta.
*  Then I went to Bristol in England, right?
*  Bristol was a slave trading port where—you know, yeah, and it's thriving.
*  It looks like a good old-fashioned bohemian town.
*  People know it now because of the dismantling of the statue of Colston, who was one of the
*  slave traders.
*  But at any rate, we can see the effects of slavery, right?
*  We can see the effects of colonialism, and we can see how the wealth of England was built.
*  Eric Williams, you know, called—talking about Liverpool, said that there's no brick
*  in Liverpool that doesn't have slave blood on it, right?
*  I have no faith in King Charles.
*  I mean, I have no faith in him at all.
*  But what's interesting to me now is the groundswell, you know, the groundswell of
*  Africans who are affected by colonialism.
*  And, okay, maybe I should just call it the global south, right?
*  I think now there's a consciousness that we don't need England, right, either materially
*  or psychologically, right?
*  Yeah, so, yeah, I would say my faith is with the people in the global south, not the monarchy.
