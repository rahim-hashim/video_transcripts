# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” February 29, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ADaxseUn8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Authorities in Gaza say Israeli forces have committed a massacre in Gaza City, killing
*  at least 104 Palestinians as they waited for food aid.
*  Gaza's health ministry says over 760 people were wounded in what Hamas called an unprecedented
*  war crime.
*  According to eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire on the crowd that had gathered
*  around humanitarian aid trucks.
*  The death toll is expected to rise as hospitals in Gaza City are struggling to treat the
*  wounded.
*  Dr. Jadallah Al-Shafaii of Al-Shifa Hospital spoke to Al Jazeera shortly after the attack.
*  Since the early hours of the morning, the hospital has been flooded with dozens of dead
*  bodies and hundreds of injured.
*  The majority of the victims suffered gunshot wounds and shrapnel in the head and upper
*  parts of their bodies.
*  They were hit by direct artillery shelling, drone missiles and gunfire.
*  All our operation rooms are full, and all medical staff have been deployed.
*  Above all, we ran out of medical supplies and fuel necessary to operate the hospital.
*  We hope we will be able to provide any lifesaving procedures to those victims.
*  All victims are in critical condition and lying on the floor.
*  We stand helpless amid the sharp shortage of supplies and staff.
*  This comes as Palestinian officials say the death toll in Gaza since October 7th has topped
*  30,000.
*  The staggering milestone, which does not account for thousands still missing or trapped under
*  rubble, represents one out of every 75 people in Gaza.
*  The U.N. says over half a million people in Gaza are on the cusp of starvation.
*  The Gaza Health Ministry reports six children recently died from dehydration and malnutrition.
*  Children are in critical condition.
*  After headlines will speak with Oregon's Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, he recently
*  visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing.
*  Here in New York, activists are observing a 24-hour vigil in front of City Hall.
*  Participants are reading the names of the 30,000 Palestinians killed since October 7th.
*  A number of city council members have appeared at the vigil since it kicked off Wednesday
*  amidst an effort to pass a ceasefire resolution in New York City.
*  Audrey Sasson, director of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, spoke yesterday.
*  You do not have to be Arab, Muslim, Palestinian, or in my case, in the case of our members,
*  Jews who say no, to speak out against an unfolding genocide.
*  You simply need to be a human being who is paying attention.
*  In Missouri, a Girl Scout troop has split from the organization after the group made
*  legal threats against the girls for running a fundraiser benefiting Palestinian children.
*  Girl Scout mother Nawal Abu Hamda said that instead of selling cookies this year, her
*  10-year-old daughter and sister troop members decided to make and sell bracelets with beads
*  in the colors of the Palestinian flag, spelling out Gaza and Palestine.
*  The Girl Scouts of eastern Missouri deemed the move political, banning them from continuing
*  their fundraiser for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.
*  In response, the girls decided to part ways with the Girl Scouts organization.
*  They're continuing their fundraiser, which has raised over $10,000 so far.
*  Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell announced he's stepping down as Senate's Republican
*  leader in November in a move that's expected to strengthen Donald Trump's control of the
*  Republican Party.
*  The 82-year-old McConnell has served 17 years as Republican leader, the longest term in
*  Senate history.
*  Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time.
*  I have many faults.
*  This understanding of politics is not one of them.
*  Senator McConnell said he plans to finish his term as senator during his leadership.
*  Mitch McConnell successfully blocked voting on Democratic bills from gun control to election
*  integrity while ramming through Republican priorities, including Trump's $2 trillion
*  tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans.
*  Mitch McConnell helped Trump stack federal courts with far-right judges.
*  He also reversed the 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court justices, allowing
*  Trump to install three right-wing ideologues on the bench a few years after stonewalling
*  President Obama's Supreme Court Justice pick.
*  Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said of McConnell, quote,
*  "'Few people have done more to undermine our democratic institutions and the rule of law
*  than Mitch McConnell,' Reich said.
*  The Supreme Court's announced it will decide whether former President Donald Trump has
*  presidential immunity and cannot be prosecuted for attempting to overturn the 2020 election.
*  Oral arguments will be held during the week of April 22nd.
*  Trump's claimed he should have total immunity from prosecution.
*  The court's decision is seen as a major victory for Trump, as it will likely further
*  delay his federal election subversion trial until possibly after the November election.
*  Meanwhile, a judge in Illinois has ruled Trump should be removed from the state's March
*  19th primary ballot for violating the Insurrectionist Clause of the 14th Amendment.
*  The judge stayed her ruling until Friday, giving Trump a chance to appeal.
*  Colorado and Maine have also ruled Trump to be ineligible.
*  The Supreme Court heard arguments in the Colorado case three weeks ago, but hasn't issued a
*  decision yet.
*  In other Trump news, The New York Times has revealed the former president has paid out
*  nearly $400,000 to cover legal expenses from his failed lawsuit against the newspaper.
*  Trump sued The Times after it revealed his confidential tax records showed he paid very
*  little in federal income tax.
*  This all comes as Trump and President Biden are both making separate trips today to the
*  U.S.-Mexico border.
*  Biden is headed to Brownsville, Texas, while Trump is going to Eagle Pass, Texas, which
*  has been the center of a standoff between the state of Texas and the federal government.
*  In other election news, Marianne Williamson has unsuspended her presidential campaign after
*  she received about 3 percent of the vote in Michigan's Democratic primary against Biden.
*  Williamson is the only Democratic candidate to support a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  In other Supreme Court news, justices appear divided along ideological lines as they considered
*  Wednesday whether the Trump administration overreached its authority when it imposed
*  a ban on bump stocks in 2018.
*  Bump stocks can turn semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns and were
*  used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, which killed 60 people and injured hundreds.
*  A decision is expected in the summer.
*  Congressional leaders announced a deal Wednesday to briefly extend government funding, avoiding
*  a partial shutdown.
*  The deal, which both the Senate and House must vote on before a Friday deadline, would
*  fund six federal agencies through March 8th and another six through March 22nd.
*  In the Texas Panhandle, the massive Smokehouse Creek fire has now burned nearly 900,000 acres
*  of land, making it the second largest wildfire in Texas history.
*  The fire is now larger than the state of Rhode Island.
*  At least one person and thousands of cattle have died in the blaze, which was sparked
*  by record heat.
*  Residents say the fire quickly swept through whole neighborhoods.
*  It came up very fast.
*  I saw the neighbor's house starting to burn and I called 911 and the fire trucks got here,
*  but it was, it just started really fast.
*  Flames were going everywhere.
*  And by the time we got back, well there was nothing left.
*  We basically have lost everything.
*  This is the only pair of pants I've got.
*  The shirt.
*  That's it.
*  Four other large fires are also burning in Texas.
*  In other news from Texas, prison officials executed 50-year-old Dallas native Ivan Avner
*  Cantu on Wednesday, despite major doubts over his conviction in a high-profile campaign
*  to save him.
*  A key witness recanted their testimony in the 2000 double homicide, which killed Cantu's
*  cousin and his cousin's fiance, and over which Cantu had always maintained his innocence.
*  Among those who called for a stay in Cantu's execution were jurors from his trial, Democratic
*  Congress members, celebrities and Catholic activists.
*  Texas medical officials injected Cantu with pentobarbital at 6.26 p.m.
*  He died 21 minutes later.
*  In other execution news, Idaho prison officials had to call off the execution Wednesday of
*  Thomas Eugene Creech.
*  After failing to establish IV lines, the all-volunteer medical team attempted to find a viable vein
*  for the lethal injection for nearly an hour, trying eight different sites on his body.
*  The execution was scheduled to be Idaho's first in 12 years.
*  In Guinea, trade unions have suspended their nationwide strike after union leader Sekou
*  Jamal Pandessa was released from prison Wednesday.
*  The strike had griffed the West African nation since it started earlier this week.
*  Two young protesters were killed Monday after clashes with police.
*  The labor-led protests came after Guinea's military, which overthrew President Al Fakonde
*  in a 2021 coup, unexpectedly dissolved the transitional government that had been in place
*  since 2022.
*  Unions accused leaders of cracking down on dissent and censoring the media.
*  Al Fakonde hit problems with the press.
*  But what junta leader Mamadi Doumbaia has done today is worse, because Doumbaia even
*  went as far as to cut off the internet in Guinea for more than a month.
*  Al Fakonde never did that.
*  In Nigeria, government workers and other sectors have launched a new nationwide strike amidst
*  growing protests over the soaring cost of living and inflation.
*  Labor leaders say President Bola Tanubu is failing to deliver on campaign promises of
*  wage increases and financial hope for the poorest households.
*  The International Criminal Court has awarded victims of Uganda's Lord's Resistance
*  Army, Commander Dominique Ongwen, more than $56 million in compensation.
*  Although the sum is a record for the ICC, it amounts to a symbolic $812 for the more
*  than 50,000 eligible survivors.
*  The tribunal's trust fund for victims is expected to pay out the money.
*  Survivors reacted to the verdict Wednesday.
*  Dominique Ongwen, once a child soldier himself, eventually became one of the LRA's top commanders.
*  He was sentenced in 2021 to 25 years and 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity,
*  including rape, murder and child abduction.
*  Back in the United States, Republicans blocked a bill that would create federal protections
*  for in vitro fertilization.
*  Senator Tammy Duckworth, who had both her daughters using IVF, brought the measure to the floor
*  in the wake of Alabama's Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children.
*  Duckworth sought to pass the bill under unanimous consent, but Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith
*  blocked it, citing vast overreach.
*  Meanwhile, Alabama Republicans have advanced several bills to protect IVF in the state,
*  which could pass as early as next week.
*  And the Justice Department has launched its investigation into Boeing after a door blew
*  off in Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 midflight last month.
*  This comes as the Federal Aviation Administration gave the company a 90-day deadline for presenting
*  a safety plan that meets current standards for new planes.
*  A recent report by the FAA found Boeing's safety culture to be inadequate and confusing.
*  Last week, Boeing announced it was replacing the head of its 737 MAX program.
