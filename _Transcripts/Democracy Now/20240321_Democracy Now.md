**Democracy Now!:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_JUYOvxhUU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Israel's assault on Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza, has entered a fourth day.
*  Al Jazeera is reporting Israel's blown up the entire special surgery center at the hospital.
*  Israel has now ordered a full evacuation of the medical complex, where thousands of Palestinians
*  had sought refuge and medical care.
*  This comes as Israel continues to attack areas across the Gaza Strip, including the Al Nusrat
*  refugee camp in central Gaza.
*  We saw a frightening sight, body parts.
*  We found the whole area destroyed.
*  A whole area was hit with a belt of fire.
*  They have not done anything.
*  They don't know the resistance or anything.
*  A mother and her children.
*  Her husband is wounded inside.
*  Her husband is an employee of the Palestinian Authority.
*  He distributes gas.
*  He has nothing to do with the resistance or anything.
*  The whole area was hit with a belt of fire.
*  And the children, as you can see, they have been dismembered.
*  We are here collecting their limbs from under the rubble.
*  There are children still there.
*  We will bury them and then go search for others.
*  As the death toll in Gaza approaches 32,000, aid groups continue to warn of catastrophic
*  hunger across the Gaza Strip.
*  Um Mohammed Sleem is a Palestinian mother in Gaza City who said her son was killed while
*  trying to get aid.
*  I want what I'm saying to reach the whole world, so they can see what Israel is doing
*  to the poor Palestinian people.
*  We have been six months, six months.
*  They are children.
*  What have they done to deserve this?
*  We are tired.
*  We no longer have energy.
*  The children in the south and the north are dying of hunger.
*  What has the baby done to die of hunger?
*  On the diplomatic front, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Egypt today after
*  a stop in Saudi Arabia.
*  At the United Nations, the U.S. has submitted a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council
*  for an immediate temporary ceasefire in Gaza tied to the release of hostages.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Republican senators in a closed-door
*  video conference that Israel would continue its assault on Gaza.
*  Netanyahu reportedly blasted Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's called
*  for new elections in Israel, and turned down Netanyahu's request to address Democrats.
*  This comes as over 100 Democratic donors and activists have written to President Biden's
*  campaign, warning the president's support for Israel's assault could cost him the
*  election, saying, quote, "'Because of the disillusionment of a critical portion of the
*  Democratic coalition, the Gaza war is increasing the chances of a Trump victory,' unquote.
*  U.S. lawmakers are moving towards cutting off funds for the next year to UNRWA, the
*  UN Palestinian Relief Agency, despite the looming famine in Gaza.
*  A massive new spending bill, being considered by Congress, would extend a suspension on
*  U.S. funding for the agency until at least March 2025.
*  Last year, the U.S. gave the agency $370 million.
*  Australia recently became the latest country to resume funding the agency, following a
*  after Israel claimed without providing evidence that UNRWA staff were involved in the October
*  7 attacks.
*  Meanwhile, internal UN documents obtained by The Guardian reveal Israeli forces in the
*  occupied West Bank have systematically harassed UN workers.
*  Some had been beaten and blindfolded at checkpoints.
*  Israel's also reportedly used UN facilities to fire on Palestinians living in refugee
*  camps.
*  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blasted Texas' anti-immigrant SB4 law on
*  Wednesday as U.S. courts continue to wrangle over its legality.
*  The law grants Texas authorities broad powers to arrest and deport anyone they suspect of
*  crossing the border without authorization.
*  This is Amla.
*  We are against the Straconian law, which is completely contrary to human rights.
*  If they intend to do deportations, which is not up to them, we won't accept deportations
*  from the Texas government, and we will not stand idly by.
*  The law is currently blocked after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals moved to halt the
*  measure Tuesday, just hours after this U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law could go into
*  effect.
*  Immigrant justice advocates warned SB4 would have devastating effects on immigrant communities
*  throughout the state of Texas.
*  This is Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights.
*  If allowed to proceed, it would have a terrible impact on communities.
*  We are talking about the fact that not only migrants crossing the border would be impacted
*  by the state immigration policy of Governor Abbott, but in general Texans, migrants in
*  Houston and Dallas and Fort Worth will be subject to a policy of persecution by local
*  and state police, where they will be asking them for immigration papers, detaining them
*  and also deporting them to Mexico.
*  In Georgia, prison officials executed William James Pai in the state's first execution
*  in over four years.
*  Fifty-nine-year-old Willie Pai was put to death with an injection of pentobarbital after
*  the U.S. Supreme Court denied a clemency appeal despite his lawyers arguing he was
*  quote intellectually disabled unquote and that the state of Georgia was not ready to
*  resume executions after halting the practice during the pandemic.
*  Pai's supporters and anti-death penalty advocates gathered for a vigil Wednesday ahead
*  of his execution.
*  is the executive director of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.
*  On the death certificate, it will say homicide.
*  The state is committing homicide.
*  And that's what's on Willie Pai's death certificate.
*  The drug itself for this particular lethal injection, to my knowledge, is a single-dose
*  drug.
*  And my understanding is that what it will do, it will boil—Willie Pai will experience
*  boiling in his own blood.
*  In Mississippi, two more former sheriff's deputies were sentenced Wednesday for torturing
*  and sexually abusing two black men in January 2023.
*  Christian Dedman was sentenced to 40 years in prison and Daniel Updike to 17 and a half
*  years.
*  The men were part of a group of officers that call themselves the Goon Squad.
*  A total of six officers have admitted to beating, handcuffing, waterboarding and tasering.
*  Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker inside a home in a majority White county outside
*  Jackson, Mississippi.
*  Two other members of the Goon Squad were sentenced on Tuesday.
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting the U.S. Justice Department and lawyers for Julian
*  Assange have had preliminary discussions about a possible plea deal that could lead to the
*  imprisoned WikiLeaks founder being released from prison.
*  However, Assange's legal team says they have been given no indication the Justice
*  Department intends to resolve the case.
*  Julian Assange has been held in London's Belmarsh Prison since 2019, awaiting possible
*  extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 175 years in prison for publishing
*  classified documents exposing U.S. war crimes.
*  In a surprise move, Ireland's leader, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, announced Wednesday
*  he is resigning, stating simply, quote, the time has come to pass on the baton.
*  No, inevitably there will be speculation as to the quote, unquote, real reason for my
*  decision.
*  These are the real reasons.
*  That's it.
*  I have nothing else lined up.
*  I have nothing in mind.
*  I have no definite personal or political plans.
*  But I'm really looking forward to having the time to think about them.
*  At 45, Varadkar is Ireland's youngest ever prime minister, or Taoiseach.
*  He is also Ireland's first openly gay leader and first Indian and mixed-race leader.
*  On Sunday, he called for a Gaza ceasefire as he joined President Biden at the White
*  House for a St. Patrick's Day celebration.
*  In Hong Kong, lawmakers unanimously passed a new national security law that further cracks
*  down on dissent and free speech.
*  Article 23 expands the definition of certain offenses and targets treason and insurrection,
*  It also allows for closed-door trials and imposes harsher penalties, including life
*  imprisonment in some cases.
*  The bill's passage marks a major defeat for pro-democracy activists and critics of
*  Beijing's tightening grip on Hong Kong.
*  In related news, a Hong Kong court Saturday sentenced 12 people to prison terms of six
*  to seven years after they were convicted of rioting when they stormed the city's legislature
*  during the 2019 pro-democracy uprising.
*  Hundreds of protesters breached and vandalized the government building on July 1, 2019, the
*  22nd anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China.
*  Indonesia's election committee officially declared Prabowo Subianto the winner of the
*  February 14 presidential polls, securing over 58 percent of the vote.
*  It was Prabowo's third attempt after losing twice to outgoing President Joko Widodo.
*  He'll assume office alongside Vice President-elect Jebrawin Rekobooming Raka, who is Joko Widodo's
*  son.
*  Prabowo, the son-in-law of former Indonesian dictator Suharto, the ex-son-in-law, is a
*  U.S.-backed former general who's been implicated in mass killings in East Timor, Papua and
*  Aceh, as well as the kidnapping and torture of activists in Jakarta.
*  In environmental news, the Biden administration announced new rules curbing tailpipe emissions
*  for passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
*  The new standards call for a 56 percent reduction in average carbon emissions by 2032.
*  The Environmental Protection Agency hopes the rule will help propel the sale of electric
*  vehicles or EVs, which last year made up less than 8 percent of all new car sales.
*  While it's the greatest ever limits imposed on tailpipe emissions, climate groups criticized
*  the EPA for slowing down the transition to EVs after the agency's initial proposal
*  was met with backlash from the auto and fossil fuel industries.
*  The Biden administration has announced another $6 billion in federal student loan cancellation
*  for 78,000 public service workers.
*  Borrowers will benefit, include teachers, nurses and firefighters who've been repaying
*  their loans for at least a decade.
*  And Republican efforts to impeach President Biden could soon peter out after a second
*  hearing failed to deliver any evidence pointing to President Biden's involvement in his
*  son Hunter Biden's business dealings.
*  With the Republican support for the impeachment eroding, Congressmember James Comer, who's
*  leading the impeachment inquiry, said he's weighing possible criminal referrals to the
*  Justice Department instead of a lawmaker vote.
*  New York Democrat Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez blasted the impeachment attempt during Wednesday's
*  hearing.
*  Clearly, what we are seeing here today is a continuation of the 15-month saga of the
*  Republican majority lost in the desert.
*  This resolution does not outline a high crime or misdemeanor.
*  It's not here.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
