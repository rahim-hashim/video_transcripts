*  NERMEEN SHAIKH, WP, Democracy Now!
*  As Gazans brace for an expected Israeli ground invasion of Ra'afa, unrelenting attacks
*  across the besieged territory continue, as the death toll tops 27,500 people, with another
*  67,000 wounded after nearly four months of daily attacks.
*  Israeli strikes hit residential areas, elementary schools, hospitals and aid distribution sites
*  all within recent days.
*  The Palestine Red Crescent Society published footage Monday showing its Shabalia headquarters
*  in northern Gaza heavily destroyed after Israeli attacks.

*  This is Juliette Touma, communications director for the U.N. Palestinian Refugee Agency.
*  JULIETTE TOUMA, UNRWA Communications Director It was not the first time an UNRWA convoy
*  with the United Nations was attacked.
*  It's the third time a convoy belonging to UNRWA has been exposed to an attack on its
*  way to the north of Gaza or when it is coming back from the north.
*  And this is not acceptable.
*  Humanitarian convoys, according to international humanitarian law, must be protected from all
*  party to the conflict, also during combat.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH The U.N. has appointed a panel to independently
*  review Israeli allegations that a handful of UNRWA staff were involved in Hamas' October
*  7 attacks.
*  The panel's findings are expected to be released in late March.
*  The U.S. and a dozen other countries have already halted funding for the life-saving
*  agency.
*  Nearly the entire population of Gaza is displaced and reliant on aid.
*  This is Aisha Abu al-Khair, a mother displaced from Gaza City.
*  AISHAH ABU AL-KHAYR, Gaza City Mother In 2024, we're dreaming of living our lives.
*  People move forward and live their lives.
*  We are still chasing a plate of food and bread for our children to survive.
*  We ask of the president of the United States to help the people of Gaza send aid.
*  He can see the situation here in Gaza and how difficult life is and how children are
*  lacking food and water.
*  Instead of helping Israel with rockets and bombardments, he should help the people of
*  Gaza and look at how much the people are struggling to get a plate of food or a loaf of bread.
*  Meanwhile, a new report by Amnesty International says Israel's army has been carrying out
*  unlawful killings of civilians in the occupied West Bank and should be investigated for
*  possible war crimes.
*  Amnesty says Israeli forces have displayed, quote, a chilling disregard for Palestinian
*  lives as a wave of brutal violence in the West Bank has intensified since Israel began
*  its assault on Gaza.
*  Amnesty investigated four separate cases of violence, including an Israeli raid on Noor
*  Shams refugee camp in Tulkarim that began October 19 and went on for at least 30 hours
*  As Israeli forces stormed dozens of homes, cut off water and electricity to the camp,
*  destroyed infrastructure with bulldozers and blocked two ambulances from reaching injured
*  residents.
*  At least 13 people, including six children, were killed in the raid.

*  inches forward amid rising regional tensions.
*  Blinken met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia Monday and will also
*  travel for meetings in Israel and the West Bank.
*  U.S. officials say Blinken's trip is aiming to ease tensions in the Middle East, where
*  the U.S. is supporting Israel's catastrophic war on Gaza, and U.S. military forces have
*  struck Yemen, Iraq and Syria in recent weeks.
*  This comes as Yemen's Houthi forces say they fired more missiles at two U.S. and U.K.-owned
*  vessels in the Red Sea.
*  The Houthi movement said such attacks will continue, quote, until the siege is lifted
*  and the aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped.
*  Meanwhile, France's new foreign minister, Stephane Sejournet, used his first official
*  visit to Israel on Monday to urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow an immediate ceasefire
*  and a massive influx of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
*  Sejournet also met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Monday, where he called
*  for an end to Israeli settler violence.
*  Nicaragua could move to take Germany, Canada, the U.K. and the Netherlands to the International
*  Court of Justice over their role in aiding Israel's genocide in Gaza.
*  Nicaragua called on the four nations to immediately stop providing arms, munitions and technology
*  to the Israeli army.
*  Meanwhile, South Africa's minister of international relations, Naledi Pandor, says she questioned
*  why International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Kareem Khan issued an arrest warrant against
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin over his actions in Ukraine, but not for Israeli Prime
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Pandor visited the ICC offices while in The Hague for the ICJ ruling on South Africa's
*  genocide case against Israel.
*  Prosecutor Khan was not able to answer the question.
*  Back in the U.S., hundreds of Pennsylvanians rallied at the state capitol in Harrisburg
*  Monday to demand the state divest millions from Israel bonds.
*  The protest was led by Jewish Voice for Peace, the Philly-Palestine Coalition and the Council
*  on American-Islamic Relations, CARE.
*  Police arrested at least 126 demonstrators.
*  State Representative Chris Robb attempted to shield protesters from arrest and later
*  defended their right to protest, evoking the history of the civil rights struggle and
*  Black History Month.
*  All the things we talked about during Black History Month or Martin Luther King Day, oh,
*  and all the great things that happened, all of those things were far more than inconvenient.
*  They were radical.
*  They were radical.
*  This is a radical expression of one's First Amendment rights.
*  In the People's House, this is the most ironic place to arrest people for expressing
*  their First Amendment rights.
*  A new report by The Guardian has exposed a growing internal rift at CNN over its one-sided
*  coverage of Israel's war on Gaza and the, quote, censoring of Palestinian perspectives.
*  CNN's Atlanta headquarters issues editorial directives for the entire network, relying
*  on official Israeli accounts.
*  In addition, all content must be approved by the Jerusalem bureau.
*  This comes amid outrage over recent inflammatory headlines in mainstream newspapers in the
*  U.S.
*  On Friday, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed titled, Welcome to Dearborn, America's
*  Jihad Capital.
*  In response, Dearborn's mayor, Abdullah Hamoud, said he was ramping up police presence
*  across religious sites and landmarks over fears of racist violence.
*  Biden and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer both condemned the article.
*  Meanwhile, longtime New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman penned an op-ed titled Understanding
*  the Middle East Through the Animal Kingdom, in which he compared Iran to a parasitoid
*  wasp, writing, quote, We have no counter-strategy that safely and efficiently kills the wasp
*  without setting fire to the whole jungle, Friedman wrote.
*  Michigan Congressmember and the only Palestinian-American U.S. lawmaker Rashid Alib said, quote, This
*  is blatant Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism that puts people's lives in danger, she
*  said.
*  In Texas, a man attacked four young Muslim Americans who were driving home from a protest
*  for Palestinian rights in Austin on Sunday.
*  Three of the victims are Palestinian-Americans, including a 23-year-old who was stabbed after
*  the attacker pulled them out of the car.
*  They say the suspect, who's been identified as Burt James Baker, yelled obscenities,
*  including the N-word, and tried to rip off a keffiyeh hanging from the car.
*  The Council on American-Islamic Relations, CARE, is calling on authorities to charge
*  Baker with hate crimes, saying, quote, Those responsible for this violence must be prosecuted
*  to the full extent of the law and those fomenting the anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim hate that
*  leads to this violence must be condemned.
*  Senegalese lawmakers voted to delay presidential elections until December 15th, following
*  President Macky Saul's announcement Saturday postponing the vote, which had been scheduled
*  for later this month.
*  Chaos overtook the parliament as opposition lawmakers attempted to block the vote in protest.
*  This is not possible.
*  They're stealing from the population of Senegal.
*  Security forces forcibly removed some lawmakers during the session.
*  The election postponement by President Saul, who's already served the maximum two terms
*  allowed, was followed by street protests and accusations of a constitutional coup by his
*  opposition.
*  Rights groups warned Senegal's democracy and political stability are at stake.
*  In Sudan, a new report by Doctors Without Borders warns at least one child dies every
*  two hours in a camp for displaced people in North Darfur, as fighting between the Sudanese
*  army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces enters its ninth month.
*  The humanitarian aid group estimates that about 13 children die each day in the Zamzam
*  camp, one of the largest sites for internally displaced people in Sudan, where MSF is the
*  sole health provider.
*  Children who are suffering from severe malnutrition are expected to die within a few weeks unless
*  they receive urgent care.
*  This comes as the World Food Program says many people are dying of starvation, as hunger
*  has doubled in Sudan over the past year due to the ongoing violence that has cut off civilians
*  from life-saving aid.
*  Some 18 million people across Sudan are facing acute hunger, while nearly 11 million have
*  been displaced from their homes.

*  voting power of poor people across the country.

*  election, with the first major coordinated actions taking place outside 30 state houses
*  on March 2.
*  This is Bishop William Barber unveiling the initiative at a press conference in Washington,
*  D.C., on Monday.
*  For far too long, extremists have blamed poor people and low-wage people for their plight,
*  while moderates too often have ignored poor people, appealing instead to the so-called
*  middle class.
*  Meanwhile, poor and low-income, low-wage people have become nearly half of this country.
*  And we are here today to make one thing clear.
*  Poor and low-wage brothers and sisters have the power to determine and decide the 2024
*  elections and elections beyond.
*  And millions of people gathered across Turkey today to commemorate one year since a devastating
*  earthquake and its aftershocks killed over 50,000 people.
*  In Antakya, the capital of Hatay, the worst-hit southern province, crowds held a moment of
*  silence at 4.17 in the morning local time, marking the moment the quake struck.
*  Protests broke out as residents continued to demand justice and accountability from
*  poorly regulated constructions and for delays in responding to the disaster, which left
*  many to die trapped in the rubble amid freezing temperatures.
*  Others gathered in Malatya to mourn the dead.
*  I lost my children.
*  I lost my daughter, son-in-law, my three grandchildren.
*  It feels like I'm living the same days again.
*  Many of their memories are left.
*  Their photos, their love is what is left.
*  They are my children.
*  What can I say?
*  It is just difficult.
*  The 7.8 earthquake and aftershocks killed some 6,000 people in northern Syria, worsening
*  an already dire humanitarian crisis after over a decade of conflict.
*  Many who lost their homes are still sleeping in tents.
*  This is a Syrian man who lost his home and remains unhoused along with his neighbor.
*  He has nothing now.
*  He is staying in this tent and has nothing.
*  His situation is really bad.
*  No one asked about him nor came to check.
*  He's staying in the tent here.
*  God help him and everyone.
*  We are all staying in tents after a year of the earthquake.
*  What can we do?
*  And those are some of the headlines.
