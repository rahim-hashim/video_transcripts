# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 26, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s4C-ng98q4)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take all measures within its power
*  to prevent genocide in Gaza.
*  The highly anticipated ruling of the World Court got underway shortly before we went
*  on air.
*  This is Joan Donahue, president of the International Court of Justice.
*  The court considers that the plausible rights in question in this proceeding, namely the
*  right of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to be protected from acts of genocide and related
*  prohibited acts identified in Article 3 of the Genocide Convention and the right of South
*  Africa to seek Israel's compliance with the latter's obligation under the convention,
*  are of such a nature that prejudice to them is capable of causing irreparable harm.
*  The ICJ started by ruling it has jurisdiction over the case brought by South Africa and
*  dismissed Israel's bid to throw it out.
*  The court, however, did not order an immediate ceasefire.
*  The interim verdict is a major blow to Israel and the United States, which have undermined
*  the case despite overwhelming evidence presented by South Africa.
*  The court will not rule today on whether Israel has committed genocide.
*  That verdict could take years.
*  We'll have more on the historic ruling after headlines.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's unrelenting assault on Gaza continues as the death toll tops 26,000,
*  with at least another 65,000 injured.
*  Over 11,000 of those killed are children.
*  Khan Yunis, once designated as the so-called safe zone, remains under intense attack,
*  with Israeli shelling and snipers reportedly targeting the Nasser and Al Amal hospitals.
*  Hundreds of families have fled the area in recent days after Israeli forces surrounded
*  the southern city.
*  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adnan Ghebreyesus, who struggled to speak after
*  becoming emotional, appealed for an immediate ceasefire.
*  Meanwhile, CIA Director William Burns will reportedly travel to France this weekend for
*  a fourth round of talks aimed at reaching a halt in the fighting and a release of the
*  remaining hostages in Gaza.
*  The talks involve officials from the United States, Israel, Qatar and Egypt.
*  This comes as tensions mount between Israel and Qatar after leaked audio surfaced of
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu calling Qatar problematic as he met with family members
*  of hostages.
*  Doha slammed the remarks as, quote, obstructing and undermining the mediation process.
*  Two more U.S. cities on Thursday passed resolutions for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Minneapolis's resolution, approved in a 9-3 vote, also called for an end to U.S. military
*  funding for Israel.
*  Meanwhile, Somerville became the first Massachusetts city to pass a ceasefire resolution after
*  months of constituent organizing.
*  Cambridge, which is home to Harvard, is expected to pass their own ceasefire resolution on
*  Monday.
*  The United States and Iraq will start talks on phasing out the U.S.-led military coalition
*  in Iraq.
*  The U.S. has more than 2,500 troops in Iraq that initially returned to Iraq in 2014 to
*  combat Islamic State fighters.
*  U.S. bases have since come under attack by Iran-affiliated groups, which have increased
*  in light of the U.S. backing of Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  In Alabama, prison officials ended the life of 58-year-old Kenneth Smith via nitrogen
*  gas asphyxiation in the nation's first-of-its-kind execution.
*  In his final statement, Smith said, quote, tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a
*  step backwards.
*  I'm leaving with love, peace and light, he said.
*  The case has garnered international condemnation.
*  Kenneth Smith's spiritual advisor, Jeff Hood, witnessed the execution and rebuked
*  Alabama's attorney general, who predicted Smith would lose consciousness within seconds
*  and die within minutes.
*  This is Jeff Hood.
*  What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life.
*  We saw minutes of someone heaving back and forth.
*  We saw spit.
*  We saw all sorts of stuff from his mouth develop on the mask.
*  We saw this mask tied to the gurney and him ripping his head forward over and over and
*  over again.
*  And we also saw correction officials in the room who were visibly surprised at how bad
*  this thing went.
*  A federal judge sentenced former Trump adviser Peter Navarro to four months in prison Thursday
*  for contempt of Congress after he defied a subpoena from the House Select Committee investigating
*  the January 6th insurrection.
*  Judge Ahmed Mehta told Navarro that citing executive privilege is not a, quote, magical
*  incantation or get-out-of-jail-free card.
*  In other Trump news, closing arguments are being delivered today in a second defamation
*  brought by writer E. Jean Carroll.
*  This trial will determine whether Trump owes Carroll more damages on top of the $5 million
*  a jury awarded her last year after finding Trump sexually abused her in the 1990s and
*  later defamed her.
*  A new study has found tens of thousands of pregnancies have resulted from rape in states
*  where abortion was banned following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  Over the past 18 months, researchers estimate there were nearly 65,000 pregnancies from
*  sexual assaults with most, if not all, survivors, including girls, forced to carry them to term.
*  Texas topped the list with 45 percent of the rape-related pregnancies.
*  In Michigan, a first-of-its-kind manslaughter trial is underway for Jennifer Crumbly, the
*  mother of the Oxford High School shooter.
*  Ethan Crumbly was just 15 years old when he opened fire on the school in 2021, killing
*  four students and injuring six other people.
*  His father, James Crumbly, is being tried separately later this year.
*  This is prosecutor Mark Keese delivering his opening statement.
*  The evidence will prove that by the time this gun was bought, the school shooter was in
*  a downward spiral that had begun months before.
*  The evidence will also show you that Jennifer Crumbly was aware of that.
*  Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his
*  growing social isolation, despite the fact that it is illegal for a 15-year-old to walk
*  into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted.
*  France's top court ruled large parts of a new, highly contested immigration bill are
*  unconstitutional.
*  The court threw out nearly half the 80 measures in the legislation, including restrictions
*  on access to welfare benefits for non-citizens and the denial of citizenship for children
*  born in France.
*  Immigrant rights activists and their allies took to the streets to welcome the move and
*  vowed to keep fighting.
*  We are asking to be equal with others.
*  We are simple.
*  And it's simple what we're asking for.
*  We want residency.
*  We want to live with dignity in this country.
*  The French are leaving here.
*  They're going to our countries.
*  We want freedom.
*  That's it.
*  Freedom, equality, fraternity.
*  In Australia, thousands of people rallied and indigenous-led protests on so-called Australia
*  day, marking the arrival of European colonizers in 1788.
*  January 26 has been dubbed Invasion Day by Aboriginal communities and their allies, who
*  are pushing to do away with the national holiday.
*  This is Aboriginal Elder Adrian Buruguba.
*  We're here to tell people that Australia Day doesn't mean anything to us.
*  It's the day of Aboriginal sovereignty.
*  That day when they came here, we have to keep telling people that we were operating under
*  our law and we still operate under our laws.
*  And the law is in the land.
*  And here in New York, a memorial service for National Security Advisor and Secretary of
*  State Henry Kissinger was met with protests Thursday.
*  Activists chanted, Burn Henry Burn, as they remembered the four million people Kissinger's
*  actions have killed across the globe.
*  We mourn the millions he killed.
*  We mourn those in Cambodia, in Vietnam, in Laos, in Bangladesh, in East Timor, in Chile,
*  in Argentina, in Cyprus, in Iraq, in Palestine and in Angola.
*  As we mourn the dead, we also honor those who fight to live.
*  The litany of resistance groups that have stood up to Kissinger's imperialism outlive
*  Henry Kissinger.
*  Activists held up signs that said Henry Kissinger a war criminal.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
