# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 26, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiBlJ2l2PKw)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The High Court in London has put the extradition of Julian Assange on hold until the United
*  States provides more assurances about how the WikiLeaks publisher will be treated in
*  U.S. custody.
*  The court asked the U.S. for assurances Assange will be permitted to rely on the First Amendment,
*  that he will not be discriminated against at trial because he's Australian, and that
*  he will not face the death penalty.
*  The court also ruled Assange may be able to file additional appeals to block the extradition,
*  but that will depend on how the U.S. responds to the court's request.
*  Assange has been held in London's Belmarsh Prison for five years, awaiting possible extradition
*  to the U.S., where he faces up to 175 years in prison for publishing classified documents
*  exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  We'll have more on the story after headlines.
*  The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and
*  the release of all remaining hostages.
*  The resolution passed 14-0, with the U.S. abstaining.
*  Nearly six months into Israel's war on Gaza, it's the first time the Security Council
*  successfully passed a ceasefire resolution after four previous attempts and continuous
*  obstruction by the United States.
*  After the resolution passed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the U.S.
*  for what he called retreating from its, quote, principled position and canceled a planned
*  visit by an Israeli delegation to Washington, D.C.
*  U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said a failure to implement the ceasefire, quote,
*  would be unforgivable.
*  Palestine's U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour spoke after the vote.
*  This must be a turning point.
*  This must lead to saving lives on the ground.
*  This must signal the end of this assault of atrocities against our people.
*  A nation is being murdered.
*  A nation is being dispossessed.
*  We'll have more on this story later in the broadcast.
*  Despite the ceasefire resolution, Israel's continued to pummel the Gaza Strip.
*  A bombing of a house in Ra'aqa killed at least 18 people earlier today, including at
*  least nine children.
*  This is one of their surviving relatives.
*  Nine children.
*  The oldest was eight years old.
*  They all had nothing to do with this.
*  They fell asleep with the news of the Ramadan ceasefire.
*  Only to wake up?
*  They didn't wake up.
*  They are not here anymore.
*  I have no one left in this world.
*  The U.N. official say at least 12 Palestinians died after hundreds swam into the Mediterranean
*  Sea to retrieve aid that had been airdropped northwest of Gaza City.
*  The U.N. Human Rights Council published a draft report Monday that found reasonable
*  grounds to believe that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
*  U.N. Special Rapporteur Francesca Obenesi writes, quote, the overwhelming nature and
*  scale of Israel's assault on Gaza and the destructive conditions of life it has inflicted
*  reveal an intent to physically destroy Palestinians as a group, she wrote.
*  In Baltimore, Maryland, search and rescue efforts are underway after multiple vehicles
*  plunged into the Patapsco River following the partial collapse of the Francis Scott
*  Key Bridge in what local officials are calling a mass casualty incident.
*  Two people have been rescued so far, one severely injured, but some 18 others could still be
*  trapped in the freezing cold water.
*  The four-lane Francis Scott Key Bridge is 1.6 miles long and part of the Interstate
*  695, a key commuter route.
*  Maryland Governor Wes Moore has declared a state of emergency.
*  The bridge collapsed after a large cargo ship collided with it early this morning.
*  The 948-foot vessel was just minutes into its journey to Colombo, Sri Lanka, when it
*  hit a column of the bridge.
*  The bridge was built in 1977.
*  In Senegal, Basir Jomai Fai has declared victory in Sunday's presidential election.
*  His main rival, former Senegalese Prime Minister Ahmedou Ba, called Fai to concede Monday after
*  provisional results put Fai at over 53 percent of the vote.
*  Fai turned 44 on Monday.
*  He'll become Africa's youngest elected president.
*  He has vowed to fight corruption and poverty and to direct Senegal's revenue from natural
*  resources to provide better economic opportunities for residents.
*  Fai spoke Monday from the capital, Dakar.
*  The Senegalese people have chosen to break with the past, to give substance to the immense
*  hopes raised by our vision of society.
*  I hope that our vision of society has given substance to their aspirations.
*  I pledge to govern with humility and transparency and to fight corruption at all levels.
*  I pledge to devote myself fully to rebuilding our institutions and strengthening the foundations
*  of our way of life together.
*  Basir Jomai Fai is backed by the popular opposition leader Ousmane Sanko, who was forbidden
*  to run.
*  Until recently, the two men were sitting in prison cells, but they were released just
*  before the election after outgoing President Macky Saul granted the pair amnesty.
*  In Ecuador, the mayor of the coastal city of San Vicente was found shot dead in a car
*  Sunday.
*  Brigitte Garcia was 27 years old, Ecuador's youngest mayor.
*  Her communications director was also killed in the attack.
*  Ecuador has been under a state of emergency since January due to rising violence by armed
*  groups linked to the drug trade.
*  This is Ecuadorian President Daniel Limboa.
*  The assassination of the mayor of San Vicente and her communications director also reminds
*  us that this fight is not over.
*  It has only just begun.
*  It also gives us a warning and precise information that there is narco-terrorism within public
*  institutions and there is narco-terrorism among public officials, which we are cleaning
*  up.
*  Still, very soon, this will come to light.
*  NBC News has come under fire by its own star anchors for hiring former Republican National
*  Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel as a political analyst.
*  On Monday, MSNBC hosts, including Mika Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough and Joy Reid, all called out
*  the decision on their live shows.
*  Rachel Maddow, MSNBC's highest-rated anchor, devoted a 30-minute monologue to the news.
*  The person who was the head of the Republican Party during Donald Trump's time in office
*  and during his effort to throw out the election result and stay in power anyway, and during
*  his effort to run for election again after having done that, is Ronna Romney McDaniel.
*  And she pitched in and helped.
*  She helped set in motion the part of the plot that involved sending fake Trump electors
*  Rachel Maddow added, quote,
*  Chuck Todd also fiercely attacked his own network.
*  A New York appeals court on Monday reduced Donald Trump's bond to $175 million in a
*  civil fraud case, down from $464 million, and gave Trump an extension of 10 days to
*  pay it as he appeals the case.
*  The ruling means New York Attorney General Letitia James will not be able to enforce
*  the judgment against Trump just yet, including the seizure of his assets.
*  Separately Monday, a New York judge rescheduled the start of Trump's hush money trial from
*  April 15th.
*  Trump's lawyers had sought to postpone his first criminal trial, arguing the recent release
*  of over 100,000 pages of evidence made it impossible to prepare in time.
*  The judge harshly disagreed.
*  We'll have more on that story with David K. Johnston, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court's hearing arguments today in a case that could severely limit
*  access to the abortion pill mephepristone, which is used for roughly two-thirds of all
*  U.S. abortions.
*  Last year, the Fifth Circuit Court sided with a right-wing Texas judge who ruled the FDA
*  improperly eased regulations on the bill to make it more accessible some 20 years ago.
*  The Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 will now decide whether to reverse
*  the FDA measures, which made the pill available through the mail and via telemedicine.
*  It could also roll back the FDA's decision to lengthen the window within which mephepristone
*  can be taken, which is now through 10 weeks of gestation.
*  And here in New York, home health aides ended their six-day hunger strike Monday, during
*  which they called on the city to end ruling 24-hour workdays.
*  The home health workers, the majority of whom are women of color and immigrant women,
*  have been demanding New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams bring the No More
*  24 Act to a vote.
*  Democracy Now! spoke to some of the hunger strikers outside City Hall.
*  ADRIENNE ADAMS, New York City Council Speaker
*  For many of us working 24-hour workdays, we are forced to work these kinds of shifts,
*  because if we refuse, then a company won't assign us work.
*  Only 24 hours or very few hours.
*  So we really need to stop this kind of practice.
*  We will continue to fight against the 24-hour workdays until Adrienne Adams passed the No
*  More 24 Act to stop it.
*  Otherwise, she will have to step down.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now! co-host Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi, Juan.
*  Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around
*  the world.
