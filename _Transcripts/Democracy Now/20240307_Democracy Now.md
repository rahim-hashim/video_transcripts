# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” March 7, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzewM6hJ6iM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  A Gaza ceasefire, before the start of Ramadan, appears increasingly unlikely, after Hamas
*  delegates left Cairo talks without an agreement after accusing Israel of thwarting efforts
*  put forward by mediators.
*  Hamas says negotiations will nonetheless continue.
*  Israel reportedly boycotted the recent talks.
*  The official death toll in Gaza has topped 30,800 in the five months since Israel's
*  assault began.
*  At least another 72,000 Palestinians have been wounded.
*  The group Refugees International's warning Israel's persistent blocking of humanitarian
*  aid into Gaza has created apocalyptic conditions inside the besieged territory.
*  At least 20,000 have starved to death, the youngest victim a day old.
*  As a number of countries have started conducting airdrops into Gaza, the World Food Program
*  cautioned, airdrops are a last resort and will not avert famine, they said.
*  This is a soup kitchen volunteer in Rafah.
*  Our hearts are being squeezed when a child comes over and says, I want to have rice and
*  chicken.
*  We are unable to provide rice, let alone chicken, in the light of the war that we are
*  experiencing.
*  This is not only a war on civilians.
*  It is a war on food, on starvation.
*  People here in the Gaza Strip cannot find bread to eat.
*  South Africa has requested the International Court of Justice take additional emergency
*  measures in Gaza, including ordering a ceasefire.
*  South Africa brought the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ.
*  The threat of all-out famine has now materialized.
*  The court needs to act now to stop the imminent tragedy."
*  Canada says it will resume funding to UNRWA after it halted support for the UN agency
*  in January following Israeli claims 12 UNRWA staff were involved in the October 7 attacks.
*  Sixteen countries suspended their funding for the agency, bringing a close to collapse
*  amidst the spiraling humanitarian disaster in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, a new investigation by The Washington Post reveals the Biden administration has
*  quietly approved over 100 weapon sales to Israel while publicly calling for restraint
*  and decrying the mounting civilian death toll.
*  We'll have more on that story later in the broadcast.
*  U.S. military officials said Wednesday a Houthi missile attack on a commercial ship in the
*  Gulf of Aden killed at least three people.
*  It's the first known deaths as a result of the Houthi campaign against Israel and
*  U.S.-linked vessels.
*  The ship that was attacked appears to have been Barbados-flagged, Greece-operated and
*  Liberia-owned.
*  U.S. and U.K. forces have launched multiple attacks inside Yemen since the Houthi strike
*  started in protest of Israel's war on Gaza.
*  A delegation of Palestinian Americans who've lost relatives to Israeli attacks in Gaza
*  joined U.N. Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour at a U.N. Security Council press conference
*  Wednesday.
*  This is Dr. Rula El-Farrah, who lost over 150 family members since October 7th.
*  In December, one of our family members, Sabri El-Farrah, was murdered in his home by an
*  Israeli airstrike with his nine young children.
*  His unfortunate wife survived.
*  She was eight months pregnant.
*  She was displaced to an evacuation camp where she gave birth to her baby boy one month later,
*  in January.
*  Her child, her newborn infant, died 20 days later from the cold and the harsh conditions
*  in the camps.
*  Every minute signifies the loss of a life, the starvation of a child.
*  And so we need an immediate and permanent, not temporary, permanent ceasefire now.
*  In Washington, D.C., activists have set up a protest in front of the Israeli embassy.
*  Israeli-American activist Mikkel Pellet says the protest has disrupted embassy business
*  and is calling on more people to join the action until the embassy is forced to shut
*  down.
*  Palestinian flags have clearly taken over the other flag that's being flown here.
*  The flag of hope has clearly taken over the flag of hate and apartheid.
*  This is the apartheid embassy.
*  And look, look at all this.
*  It's brilliant, as far as the eye can see.
*  Mikkel Pellet is the son of a famous Israeli general.
*  In Austin, Texas, at least five musical acts have pulled out of the upcoming South by Southwest
*  Festival over its ties to the U.S. military and military contractors, including RTX Corporation,
*  formerly known as Raytheon.
*  RTX supplies weapons to Israel.
*  Outside the United States, Brazil's Central Workers Union, which represents over 7.4 million
*  workers, has called on the Brazilian government to cancel all military cooperation with Israel.
*  In Canada, rights groups are suing the Global Affairs Ministry for exporting military goods
*  and technology to Israel during its assault on Gaza.
*  In Ukraine, a Russian attack on the port city of Odessa killed at least five people, according
*  to the Ukrainian Navy.
*  The strike came as President Volodymyr Zelensky was taking the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
*  on a tour of the war-ravaged city, where 12 people, including children, were killed in
*  a drone attack last week.
*  The Greek Prime Minister spoke after Wednesday's attack, which the two leaders heard as they
*  were getting into their cars following the tour.
*  And I think this is one more reason why all European leaders should come to Ukraine, because
*  it is one thing to see, to hear the description from the mass media or from President Zelensky.
*  with whom we regularly communicate.
*  And it is completely different to experience the war firsthand.
*  In Russia, Yulia Navalny, the widow of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is
*  urging voters to protest President Vladimir Putin at the polls in the March 17 election.
*  We need to use the election day to show that we exist and there are many of us.
*  We are real.
*  We are alive.
*  We exist and we are against Putin.
*  We need to come to the polling station on the same day and time, noon of March 17.
*  It is up to you to choose what to do next.
*  You can vote for any candidate but Putin.
*  You can spoil the ballot.
*  You can write on it in big letters, Navalny.
*  The Miami Herald is reporting the Biden administration's pressuring Haiti's unelected Prime Minister
*  Ariel Henry to resign amidst an armed uprising against his rule.
*  According to a U.S. document obtained by the Miami Herald, the Biden administration's
*  proposed Henry, quote, step down in the near future.
*  The State Department pushed back on the report, but the U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield
*  confirmed the U.S. has asked Henry to form a transitional council that would involve
*  the appointment of a new prime minister.
*  For the past three years, the U.S. has been a key backer of Henry, who's deeply unpopular
*  in Haiti.
*  Last week, Ariel Henry visited Kenya to discuss a plan to send a thousand international Kenyan
*  police officers to Haiti.
*  Henry is now in Puerto Rico, unable to safely return home.
*  Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign Wednesday after losing all but Vermont to
*  Donald Trump on Super Tuesday.
*  Haley declined to endorse Trump or any other candidate as she announced the end of her
*  campaign.
*  In all likelihood, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee when our party convention
*  meets in July.
*  I congratulate him and wish him well.
*  It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did
*  not support him.
*  And I hope he does that.
*  President Biden made a pitch to Haley's supporters, saying, quote, I know there's
*  a lot we won't agree on, but on the fundamental issues of preserving American democracy,
*  on standing up for the rule of law, on treating each other with decency, dignity and respect,
*  on preserving NATO and standing up to America's adversaries, I hope and believe we can find
*  common ground, Biden said.
*  On Capitol Hill, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who's leaving his leadership
*  post in November, endorsed Donald Trump.
*  In 2021, McConnell said Trump was morally and practically responsible for the January
*  6th insurrection and called Trump's actions a, quote, disgraceful dereliction of duty.
*  In more related news, the Supreme Court has set April 25th as the date to hear arguments
*  over whether Trump's immune from criminal prosecution for trying to overturn his 2020
*  election loss.
*  President Biden will deliver his State of the Union address tonight before a joint session
*  of Congress.
*  Biden is expected to call for increasing taxes on billionaires and corporations.
*  First Lady Dr. Jill Biden's guests include United Auto Workers President Sean Fain and
*  the prime minister of Sweden.
*  Numerous lawmakers are inviting relatives of hostages held in Gaza.
*  is bringing Dr. Intima Aslama, a Palestinian dentist and graduate student from St. Louis
*  University, who's lost 35 relatives in Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Republican Congressmember Thomas Massie has invited the brother of Julian Assange, the
*  imprisoned WikiLeaks editor who's facing U.S. extradition and, if found guilty in a
*  U.S. court, 175 years in jail he could have to serve.
*  Senator Tim Kaine is bringing Elizabeth Carr, the first woman born by IVF in the United
*  States.
*  And Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has invited the parents of Evan Gershkovich,
*  the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia.
*  Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill protecting in vitro fertilization
*  clinics and doctors from lawsuits and prosecution.
*  Senators scrambled to pass the legislation.
*  After Alabama's Supreme Court ruled last month frozen embryos have the same rights
*  as children, sending shockwaves through the medical community.
*  At least three clinics suspended treatments in Alabama in response to the ruling.
*  Two of those said they will now resume treatment.
*  Reproductive rights advocates cautioned the new law does not fully resolve the issue as
*  it does not address whether a frozen embryo can be considered a child.
*  To see our segments on IVF go to democracynow.org.
*  France became the first country in the world to enshrine the right to abortion in its constitution.
*  Following the 780 to 72 vote, the Eiffel Tower was lit up with the phrase, my body, my choice.
*  Abortion has been legal in France since 1975, but lawmakers decided to take the additional
*  step in direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.
*  This is leftist lawmaker Mathilde Panot.
*  We are celebrating a historic victory.
*  Our vote is a promise made to the future.
*  Never will our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren have to relive the
*  torment that has preceded them.
*  Our vote is also a promise to all women around the world who are fighting for the right to
*  have control over their bodies in Argentina, in the United States, in Andorra, in Italy,
*  in Hungary, in Poland.
*  Like an echo, today's vote tells them that their fight is ours and that this victory
*  is theirs.
*  New York Governor Kathy Hoco has announced a plan to deploy 1,000 members of the National
*  Guard and state police to patrol New York City subway stations and to check bags of
*  passengers.
*  New York Civil Liberties Union head Donna Lieberman condemned the plan, saying, quote,
*  these heavy-handed approaches will, like stop and frisk, be used to accost and profile black
*  and brown New Yorkers ripping a page straight out of the Giuliani playbook.
*  Today's announcement fails to address longstanding problems of homelessness, poverty or access
*  to mental health care, Lieberman said.
*  And in New Mexico, a jury found Hannel Gutierrez Reed, the weapons handler on the film Rust,
*  guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the 2022 killing of cinematographer Helena Hutchins
*  by a loaded prop gun.
*  Jurors agreed that Gutierrez Reed, whose father is a prominent armorer in Hollywood, displayed,
*  quote, willful disregard for the safety of others, unquote.
*  She faces up to 18 months in prison.
*  Alec Baldwin, who fired the gun during a rehearsal, is the star and producer of Rust.
*  He'll face his own manslaughter trial in July.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
