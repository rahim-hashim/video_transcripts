# What Is the Comstock Act? Texas Judge Cites 1873 Anti-Obscenity Law to Halt Abortion Pill Approval
**Democracy Now!:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCvPLlWwr9I)
*  When the U.S. district judge, the federal judge Matthew Kozmarek, ruled Friday in Texas
*  that the Food and Drug Administration's 23-year-old approval of the leading abortion drug, methopristone,
*  violates the law, he cited the 1873 Comstock Act.
*  The so-called anti-vice law prohibits the mailing or distribution of, quote, obscene
*  materials and has been dormant for half a century.
*  After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the 50-year-old federal right to
*  abortion in its Dobbs decision last year, the Justice Department issued a memorandum
*  that said the Comstock Act does not prohibit the mailing of such drugs as methopristone.
*  But in his ruling, the Trump-appointed anti-abortion judge Kozmarek agrees with plaintiffs in the
*  case that the law does in fact prohibit mailing the drug.
*  For more, we're joined by Lauren McIver Thompson, historian of birth control, specialist
*  in specifically the Comstock Act.
*  Lauren McIver Thompson, if you can explain what this ruling is he invoked from 18—from
*  the 19th century, 1870—what was it?
*  Nine?
*  1873.
*  Yeah, 1873, you're right.
*  So yeah, this—as a historian, when I read the opinion on Friday afternoon, I was just
*  kind of gobsmacked, although I guess we shouldn't be surprised, as Jessica and Alexis already
*  pointed out.
*  The Comstock Act of 1873 was a—the product of a vice reformer, Anthony Comstock, who
*  lobbied Congress in 1873, and the law was passed in March of 1873.
*  So we're looking at 150 years now, just last month.
*  And the law essentially criminalized anything having to do with sex at the federal level,
*  And that included instruments that could be used for the prevention of conception or to
*  procure abortion.
*  And so for the judge to raise the Comstock law from the dead, essentially, as a viable
*  legal strategy in order to achieve a ban on medication abortion, you know, as a historian,
*  I just really saw us kind of coming full circle and not in a good way.
*  And talk more about this and talk more about who Comstock was and what this means about
*  where this country is going.
*  Yeah, that's such a good question, because I think we do have to look at Anthony Comstock
*  specifically as a person.
*  It illustrates in many ways how one person can have a really outsized impact on our democracy.
*  Comstock served in the Union Army, where he was really scandalized by the amount of alcohol,
*  pornography, you know, that his fellow soldiers were taking advantage of during the Civil
*  War.
*  And after the war, he went to New York, where he aligned himself with the Young Men's Christian
*  Association, and he started a sort of offshoot of that group called the New York Society
*  for the Suppression of Vice.
*  And at that point, he actually went—he was funded to go down to Washington, D.C., and
*  to lobby Congress for this obscenity law.
*  And he was just obsessed with sex, and he was able to get the senators and representatives
*  at the time on board.
*  And it was one of the quickest laws that has ever been passed in American history.
*  There was really, really no opposition to it.
*  And so, yes.
*  I was just going to say, Michelle Goldberg writes in The New York Times, the Comstock
*  Act, the notorious anti-obscenity law used to indict the Planned Parenthood founder Margaret
*  Sanger, banned books by D.H. Lawrence and arrest people by the thousands, turning 150
*  last month.
*  Yes.
*  This was a law with teeth.
*  There were steep fines for violating the Comstock Act.
*  Certainly, you could be sentenced to hard labor, you could be sentenced to years in
*  prison.
*  And this really ensnared ordinary Americans in this kind of vast anti-obscenity legal
*  regime.
*  And it's one of those things where, you know, when you look at it as a whole, it was, you
*  know, absolutely a violation of the Constitution.
*  And it wasn't until the 1920s that there were cases that began to kind of chip away,
*  at the Comstock Act.
*  But really, it was one of those laws that, at the federal level, that just kind of increased
*  and expanded an already existing anti-abortion legal regime, because there had been state
*  laws existing for 30 or 40 years before that, before the Comstock Act was passed.
*  We always talk about resistance.
*  And in 2019, you wrote a piece in The Times, women have always had abortions.
*  You talk about the 17th and 18th centuries' abortion legal under common law before quickening
*  or when the pregnant woman could feel the fetus move, beginning around 16 weeks.
*  You write later,
*  Beginning in the 1850s, however, the crusade against abortion began in earnest.
*  This fascinating history, relay it.
*  Yeah.
*  So, there were—there was actually no laws about abortion at all until the beginning
*  in the 1830s and 1840s.
*  But in the 1850s, particularly with the sort of spearheading of the American Medical Association,
*  physicians in this country began to work with legislators, white physicians, white legislators,
*  began to work together to criminalize abortion, essentially by 1900 in every state in the
*  union.
*  And so, what you had was a statewide network of anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws.
*  And then layered on top of that, by 1873, you have the Comstock Act.
*  So, somebody seeking to abort a pregnancy or to prevent conception—and by the way,
*  there were, you know, reproductive control items were everywhere in America in the 19th
*  century.
*  You could order barrier methods from any kind of mail order catalog or obtain them at the
*  pharmacy.
*  Women were managing their fertility at home with these things.
*  But to do so was risking a legal arrest.
*  It was a dangerous prospect to do so because of the legal regime that gets put into place
*  at both the federal and the state levels.
*  And finally, Kesmerick's language, not only talking, of course, about the Comstock Act,
*  but referring to fetuses as unborn humans.
*  Yes.
*  So, what's really kind of interesting about that, if interesting is the word, is that,
*  you know, the anti-abortion movement's emphasis on fetal personhood these days, you know,
*  that's been around since the 1960s.
*  It's kind of decades old.
*  But originally, the passage of abortion laws and the Comstock Act were really not focused
*  on the idea that the fetus was a person.
*  These laws were rooted in anti-immigrant sentiment, eugenic sentiment, the idea that not enough
*  white middle-class women were having babies because they were the ones seeking contraception
*  and abortion.
*  And so, physicians, although they kind of paid lip service to the idea that abortion
*  was murder, they were really kind of—if you look at it in terms of a pie, that was
*  just kind of one piece of the pie.
*  The other pieces of the pie included misogyny, racism and eugenic sentiment.
*  So, for this kind of invocation of the fetus as a person, you know, that's something
*  that was—is different than it was in the 19th century.
*  And I think what the Comstock Act reviving that might achieve is it's going to essentially,
*  if this kind of decision goes through and carries forward, we're going to end up seeing
*  a sort of nationwide ban on abortion through the Comstock Act rather than trying to convince
*  the rest of America that fetal personhood and the 14th Amendment and the rights of a
*  fetus, you know, should ban abortion nationwide.
*  So, they may not have to go down that path if they can ban abortion nationwide through
*  the Comstock Act.
*  Lauren McIver-Thompson, want to thank you for being with us, historian of birth control—
*  Thank you.
