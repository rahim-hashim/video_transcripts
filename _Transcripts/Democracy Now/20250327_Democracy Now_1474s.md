Elon Musk was born in 1971 in Johannesburg, South Africa, and raised in a wealthy family under the country's racist apartheid laws. Musk's family history reveals ties to apartheid and neo-Nazi politics. We speak with Chris McGreal, reporter for The Guardian, to understand how Musk's upbringing shaped his worldview, as well as that of his South African-raised colleague Peter Thiel, a right-wing billionaire who co-founded PayPal alongside Musk. "Musk lived what can only be described as a neocolonial life," said McGreal. "If you were a white South African in that period and you had any money at all, you lived with servants at your beck and call."

# Elon Musk's Family History in South Africa Reveals Ties to Apartheid & Neo-Nazi Movements
**Democracy Now:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amy Goodman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=2.92s)]
*  We end today's show with Part 2 of my recent interview with the reporter Chris McGreal, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=4.04s)]
*  who was the Johannesburg correspondent for The Guardian during the last years of apartheid [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  through 2002. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=13.36s)]
*  He's been closely following the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who was born in 1971 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=14.36s)]
*  in Johannesburg, South Africa, and raised under the country's racist apartheid laws. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Some of McGreal's pieces include What Does Elon Musk Believe? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=25.2s)]
*  How the roots of the PayPal mafia extend to apartheid South Africa. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=28.8s)]
*  I began by asking Chris McGreal to discuss Musk's grandfather, Joshua Haldeman. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=32.8s)]
*  We see Musk's grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, he immigrates to South Africa in 1950. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=37.92s)]
*  And that's really when apartheids just started to kick in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=47.16s)]
*  The 1950s are when the most—the first laws—South Africa had discriminatory laws before, but [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=50.24s)]
*  you see the specific apartheid laws, which are much more aggressive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=57.52s)]
*  In many ways, reminiscent of the Nazi Nuremberg laws against Jews in the 1930s, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=61.2s)]
*  they have very similar echoes in stripping black people from the right to work in certain places, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=66.16s)]
*  their movements, controlling them, confining them to areas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  You already had a situation which has now come to the fore because of recent events with Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  You mean with Elon Musk giving the Nazi salute? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=85.36s)]
*  Yes, but also with the sanctions over land. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=89.12s)]
*  Is that the 1913 Land Act had already deprived most black people of land in South Africa anyway. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=92.72s)]
*  At that point, the 7% or 10%, as it was of the population that was white, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  owned more than 85% of the land under the Land Act of 1913. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=104.72s)]
*  So the apartheid laws kick in in the 1950s. Musk was born—Elon Musk was born in 1971 in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=110.88s)]
*  Johannesburg, and at that point, the Prime Minister was a guy called John Forster. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=118.88s)]
*  And John Forster's background is very telling really because Forster in the 1930s had been a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=123.2s)]
*  member of a neo-Nazi militia called the OB, which was openly sympathetic and linked to the Nazis in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=128.56s)]
*  Germany. It was responsible for all kinds of attacks, but including burning Jews out of their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  businesses in Johannesburg. And we're talking about what years? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=143.36s)]
*  In the 1930s, so the late 1930s. And then South Africa goes to war as an ally of Britain against [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=146.24s)]
*  Hitler. The OB and the groups that support them, people like Forster, they actively oppose [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  that. They actually are in touch with—OB is in touch with German military intelligence, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=164.8s)]
*  and they plan to assassinate the Prime Minister of South Africa, Jan Smuts, and overthrow the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  government and have it support Hitler. That plan fails because the Germans are unable to provide [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=177.28s)]
*  the necessary weapons and back out. But in 1942, John Forster, later Prime Minister, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=183.44s)]
*  stands up and gives a speech, and he talks about the system, their kind of ideological [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=190.24s)]
*  belief system, which was Christian nationalism. And he says, Christian nationalism in South Africa [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=197.52s)]
*  is the same as Nazism in Germany and fascism in Italy. It's all anti-democratic. It's all the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=203.68s)]
*  same thing. By 1971, when Elon Musk is born, that man is the Prime Minister of South Africa. And [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=210.96s)]
*  Christian nationalism is the basis of not only the political philosophy, but the entire education [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=219.2s)]
*  system that Elon Musk is brought up into. So take us from Elon Musk's grandfather moving [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=224.48s)]
*  to South Africa in the 50s to his father, how they gained their wealth. So Elon Musk's grandfather [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=231.28s)]
*  moves there in the 1950s. He's not particularly prosperous. He arrives without a lot of money, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=238.56s)]
*  but it's Elon Musk's father, Errol, who makes the real money, principally through investments [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=243.6s)]
*  in emerald mines in Zambia. And mining conditions in Southern Africa in that period were really [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=250.88s)]
*  pretty dire in the 1960s and 70s. Very high death rate, very poor conditions, but the owners got [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=259.68s)]
*  very rich. And Musk lived what can only be described as a neo-colonial life. If you were [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=266.32s)]
*  white South African in that period and you had any money at all, you lived with servants at your [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=275.2s)]
*  beck and call. You lived in sprawling housing. And what you see with Errol Musk is that when [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=280.08s)]
*  we get a glimpse into just how much money he had when he and Elon's mother get divorced, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=289.92s)]
*  she says at the time that, well, he owns a yacht, he owns a jet, he owns several houses, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  so there was considerable wealth there. Was the grandfather of Elon Musk on the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  record in his support for Foster? Well, he was certainly on the record in his support for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=311.12s)]
*  apartheid. Very vividly so, yes. And he said that that's why he moved to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=317.36s)]
*  South Africa from Canada in 1940, was in support of it. Now, the grandfather himself is killed a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  few years later in a plane crash, but is not known what Elon Musk's grandmother's personal views of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=330.24s)]
*  Foster particularly were, but they were both avid supporters of the apartheid system. And the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=340.0s)]
*  grandmother lived for a number of years afterwards. So you've been talking about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=345.52s)]
*  Elon Musk's maternal grandparents and how they moved to South Africa, but talk about their roots [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=348.96s)]
*  in Canada. Originally, the grandparents have no connection to South Africa. They're born and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  grew up in Canada. And in the 1930s, the grandfather, Joshua Holderman, he's head of the Canadian branch [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  of a U.S. movement called Technocracy Incorporated. And Technocracy Incorporated is essentially a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=368.32s)]
*  movement to overthrow democratic government in the United States and have technocrats, but big [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=373.76s)]
*  businessmen in many ways, come in and run the country. That's partly a reaction to FDR's election [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=379.76s)]
*  and New Deal and massive reforms that he's introduced in the United States. So from Canada, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=386.64s)]
*  they would help to launch a coup against FDR? No. Canada had its own branch of this movement [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=392.08s)]
*  to overthrow the government in Canada. He, Holderman, heads that branch. And through the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=398.64s)]
*  1930s, it takes on increasingly fascist overtones. They start wearing gray uniforms modeled on the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=404.08s)]
*  Nazi brown and black shirts. And so when Canada declares war on Germany in 1939 alongside Britain, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=409.44s)]
*  the movement is banned because it's clearly sympathetic to Hitler. Then Holderman is arrested. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=418.64s)]
*  Elon Musk's grandfather. Elon Musk's grandfather is arrested. They find documents sympathetic to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  the Nazis and other subversive documents inside his house. And he is sent to prison for a few [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  months and then remains on essentially a subversion watch list for the rest of the war. So he's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=437.04s)]
*  basically regarded as a Nazi sympathizer, a fellow traveler. And about a decade later, he moves to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=443.76s)]
*  South Africa. Why? So after the war, he founds another political movement which has deep [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=450.48s)]
*  anti-Semitic roots and actually promotes the forgery, the protocols of the elders of Zion. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=455.76s)]
*  But obviously after the war and the Holocaust, there's no real appetite for that. In Canada, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=465.04s)]
*  it's a failing political movement. And so his eye casts down to South Africa. By 1950, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  the apartheid government has been in power for two years. And Holderman looks at it and thinks [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=477.2s)]
*  that's just my kind of place, which clearly that was what he would want to create in Canada and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  had been trying to create in the 1930s. And so that's the point at which he and his wife, May, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  they move to South Africa and become very fervent supporters of apartheid. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=496.64s)]
*  Now I wanted to blend in some breaking news. In addition to cutting off all aid to South Africa, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  news of the region, and that is Sam Njoma, the freedom fighter turned president who led [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=506.32s)]
*  Namibia to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990, has died at the age of 95, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=512.24s)]
*  often referred to as Namibia's founding father, known for his motto, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  a united people striving to achieve a common good for all members of society will always emerge [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=524.48s)]
*  victorious, was used to be called Southwest Africa, became the independent Namibia. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=529.92s)]
*  Talk about Sam Njoma and how that fits into this picture of South Africa through apartheid. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  So Sam Njoma was the head of the Southwest Africa People's Organization, which was the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=544.24s)]
*  liberation movement of Namibia. Swapo. Swapo, indeed. Really, Swapo takes off and is able to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=549.36s)]
*  have effect after Angola becomes independent with the fall of the Portuguese dictatorship. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=558.32s)]
*  Portuguese colonizers leave Angola and Angola provides a base then for Swapo to really [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=565.52s)]
*  um fight to liberate Southwest Africa. That becomes known as the border war. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=572.0s)]
*  Euphemistically, the South Africans call it the border war. They actually invade Angola [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=578.24s)]
*  in an attempt to overthrow the Marxist leaning government of Angola, but also to keep Swapo at [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=582.4s)]
*  bay. But the war goes on and eventually South Africa loses that war. At that period, though, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=587.84s)]
*  one of the things you see is that Peter Thiel, another member of the PayPal mafia, very close [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=595.36s)]
*  friend of Musk, he had been at school in Johannesburg, but his father gets a job on [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=600.88s)]
*  uranium mine near Swakopmund in what is then Southwest Africa. And so Peter Thiel moves there [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  as a child and goes to school there. And the thing to know about South West Africa, the reason it was [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=615.92s)]
*  separate from South Africa is that it had been a German colony until the end of the First World War. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=620.32s)]
*  Then it becomes falls under South Africa's mandate, partly because at that point, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  South Africa was a British colony. When South Africa becomes a republic in the 60s, it hangs [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  on to Southwest Africa and it becomes a South African colony. But the population, big part of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=638.48s)]
*  the population was of German ancestry. And you could, I remember going to Windhoek in the early [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=646.08s)]
*  90s and the main thoroughfare through Windhoek was called Hermann Göringstrasse, named not after [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=654.96s)]
*  the Luftwaffe chief, but after his father, who had been a governor of German Southwest Africa. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=661.76s)]
*  In Swakopmund, it was even more extreme. It was notorious for many, many years, really into the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=668.0s)]
*  80s and 90s, as a hotbed of open support, continued support for the Nazis and for Hitler. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=677.76s)]
*  The New York Times has a story from the mid 70s of a reporter pulling up at a gas station [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=683.84s)]
*  to get his car filled with gas and the attendant openly giving a Nazi salute and saying, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=690.56s)]
*  Heil Hitler to him. You could go to curio shops in Swakopmund and they would sell Nazi themed mugs [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=697.12s)]
*  and flags and things and they openly celebrated Hitler's birthday every May. Thiel went to a [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=707.04s)]
*  German school there. So that's the atmosphere he grows up in. His father is an official on a [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=714.72s)]
*  uranium mine there. And the interesting thing about the uranium mine, amongst many other things, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=721.44s)]
*  is that it supplied part of the uranium to develop the South African atomic bombs in the 1970s, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=726.4s)]
*  which were developed in league with Israel. Now, part of the deal with Israel was that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=733.12s)]
*  South Africa would deliver yellowcake uranium to Israel. We don't know where the yellowcake came [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=741.12s)]
*  from. It may have come from that Swakopmund area mine or it may have come from somewhere else in [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=746.4s)]
*  South Africa. But South Africa was shipping yellowcake to Israel at the same time because [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=751.76s)]
*  it too was developing nuclear weapons. And talk about what Peter Thiel has said about all of us. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  I remember as we cover conventions for decades now, Peter Thiel standing up at the first [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=763.36s)]
*  Republican convention that nominated President Trump and supporting him and who he is. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=770.16s)]
*  So Peter Thiel has said of his time in Swakopmund and particularly the school which he described [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=777.12s)]
*  as particularly a brutal education, that it turned him against government and into a libertarian. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=781.68s)]
*  And I think that's an interesting element in all of this is that one of the things that isn't [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=789.76s)]
*  necessarily appreciated outside of South Africa is that there's two kinds of whites there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=795.3599999999999s)]
*  There's the Afrikaners who we've been talking about, but there's a big English-speaking white [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  population. And one of the aspects of the English-speaking population was they, on paper, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=803.68s)]
*  said they opposed apartheid but they gained all of its benefits. And most of them, certainly not [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  all, there were some really heroic individuals, but most of them did very little to actually end [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=817.12s)]
*  apartheid. But one of the products of that is you have people like Musk and Thiel who have done very [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=822.48s)]
*  well and whose parents did very well out of the apartheid system, who deny responsibility for it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  They blame it on the Afrikaners, they blame it on a government, extreme government, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=835.2800000000001s)]
*  extreme right-wing government. But then they have to explain how it is that their own parents [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  were so able to do so well out of apartheid. And then they put that down to individual talent, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=846.0s)]
*  that they're naturally gifted, and that leads them down this whole libertarian path, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  anti-government path, because essentially they have to explain how they too were benefits of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=856.24s)]
*  apartheid without taking responsibility. And talk about their relationship. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=865.04s)]
*  Well, they're co-founders of PayPal together. They both essentially share the same kind of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=866.88s)]
*  worldview from what I can make out. They're libertarians, they're very opposed to any kind of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=871.76s)]
*  DEI. You've seen a deep, deep hostility to DEI. I think Thiel buys into the same message about [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=879.36s)]
*  anti-white, the war on white people in South Africa that South African white groups like [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  AfriForum have been pushing in the United States. So I think they're, you know, philosophically, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=894.72s)]
*  they're very similar, and obviously they have a very close relationship. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=900.32s)]
*  And then talk about David Sacks. And talk more specifically about what you're referring to as [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  the PayPal mafia. I don't think most people in this country understand all of these connections [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=913.36s)]
*  and this unusual situation where these, what some of the wealthiest men in the world work together, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=918.48s)]
*  founded PayPal, and now surround the president of the United States. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=925.92s)]
*  Yes, so David Sacks was born in Cape Town in the 70s, and he moves, his parents take him to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=930.48s)]
*  Tennessee when he's five years old. So he didn't grow up in the same milieu as Musk and Thiel, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=938.88s)]
*  but he did grow up in the white South African diaspora, for sure. He clearly shares the same [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=946.72s)]
*  views. You know, as you say, they're part of the PayPal mafia, they all get rich from the creation [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=955.12s)]
*  of this company. They're all at the top running it. And now Sacks has emerged as Trump's AI and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=960.88s)]
*  crypto czar, again, part of the same project. So you can see this. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=969.04s)]
*  And he was a chief fundraiser for President Trump, as you said, born in Cape Town. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=972.96s)]
*  Yes, a big, so they've all emerged with essentially, from what I can make out, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=979.36s)]
*  the same philosophy. And of course, that's only been reinforced by their success. They're [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=983.76s)]
*  convinced, obviously, of their own genius and worth, and that government, whether it's South [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=990.88s)]
*  African government or, in this case, it seems to be the U.S. government, is an obstacle to success. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=997.6s)]
*  And then we talked about it in part one, finally, Roloff Bota making this little quartet, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1003.12s)]
*  white men of a certain age together, and his history also a part of the PayPal mafia. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1009.68s)]
*  Yes, he's part of it. And he's been he has not emerged as an as a open supporter of Trump. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1016.16s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure what his personal views are on this, but he does have a very interesting [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1024.0s)]
*  background. His grandfather was Pick Bota, who was the last foreign minister of apartheid South [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1029.52s)]
*  Africa. And Pick Bota's job essentially was to go around the world, particularly the West, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1035.04s)]
*  and assure them that apartheid was being amended, was being dismantled, when in fact it was in many [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  ways, although what was known as petty apartheid, which was the routine discriminations, the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1049.84s)]
*  segregation was being dismantled. In fact, the political system was actually only [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1055.36s)]
*  reinforcing it, solidifying it. The government of the time cooked up a system of three parliaments [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1062.64s)]
*  that would represent different parts of the population, but and give people who weren't [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1070.56s)]
*  some people who weren't white a vote. But none of those people were black. There was no black [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1075.52s)]
*  parliament, partly because they were being pushed into the independent homelands. The idea was that [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1080.0s)]
*  they were no longer South African anyway. So Pick Bota went around trying to apologize and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1084.64s)]
*  excuse for this system. And he was successful with conservatives. He saw a lot of Reagan and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1089.84s)]
*  people. They loved him here. And the same with Thatcher in Britain. They saw them as the acceptable [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1096.0s)]
*  face of apartheid. And he was so deluded by the end. He was convinced. I remember meeting him [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1101.6s)]
*  during the era of the transition to democracy from apartheid. He was so convinced that he was [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1108.56s)]
*  indispensable to the system that Mandela would have to appoint him foreign minister, which he [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1113.84s)]
*  duly did not. Would you say the background of all these men's families was fleeing Mandela's South [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1119.52s)]
*  Africa? Well, they did. Some of them left before. I mean, it's worth noting that Elon Musk left [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1125.92s)]
*  in 1988 at the age of 18, just as he would have become eligible to be drafted into the South [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1133.28s)]
*  African army as all white males were at that point, which might have led him to be fight the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1141.04s)]
*  border war that I was talking about in Angola against Swapo, or it might have led him into the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1145.84s)]
*  townships, which at that point were in complete ferment. And you had a huge amount of civil [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1151.1999999999998s)]
*  unrest in South Africa at that point. The country had largely become ungovernable. It was under a [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1157.76s)]
*  state of emergency. And the white troops were trying to keep some form of order in the black [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1163.52s)]
*  townships like Soweto. He left before he had to do any of that. So very interestingly, for people [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1167.84s)]
*  aren't aware, Elon Musk had a company called X.com. It was an online bank. It merged with [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1174.96s)]
*  Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The merge company was renamed PayPal in 2001. And you have all of [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1183.76s)]
*  these guys who you've just laid out. Well, I think Bota is a partner at Sequoia Capital, but [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1192.0s)]
*  now key players. And that brings us to Trump's order on Friday to cut off all aid to South Africa [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1198.16s)]
*  and offer refugee status in the United States to the white South Africans who are, quote, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1207.6000000000001s)]
*  victims of unjust racial discrimination. But interestingly, many in the right wing [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1212.64s)]
*  white lobby say they want to stay and focus on ending black majority rule. This is Flip Base, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1219.2s)]
*  the chairperson of what's called the Solidarity Union. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1227.2s)]
*  So he is speaking in front of a sign that says AfriForum. Put this in context. And what about [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1249.8400000000001s)]
*  AfriCon or saying, no, this is our land. We don't want to come to the United States. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, AfriForum is backpedaling furiously now because there's been a huge backlash in South [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1261.68s)]
*  Africa from people who blame it for this situation. In fact, some people have accused it of treason. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1266.24s)]
*  But if you look at what AfriForum was saying just a decade ago, and certainly in 2018, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1272.8s)]
*  when people like Kali Kriol, who was head of the AfriForum and others were coming to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1278.8s)]
*  the United States, they were claiming there was a white genocide. They were claiming there was a [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1285.84s)]
*  war on white people in South Africa. And they were essentially trying to characterize the post-apartheid [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1290.8s)]
*  era of oppression of Africanas, that they were the true victims of it. And they're not alone in this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1298.72s)]
*  There had been a phenomenon ever since the end of apartheid of Africanas painting themselves as [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1306.24s)]
*  victims. There was a song emerged in the 1990s called De La Rey. It was very popular with [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1312.08s)]
*  Africanas. It was sung in bars and rugby matches. And De La Rey was a famous general who fought to [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1318.96s)]
*  the bitter end against the British in the Boer War, the Second Boer War, in the early 20th century, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1323.84s)]
*  which the Africanas then lost. And this song essentially is an attempt to take Africanas back [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1330.88s)]
*  to a time when they were the victims, when it was their women and children dying in the British [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1338.48s)]
*  concentration camp, when they were the people who were oppressed. And it conjures up this Boer [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1342.8000000000002s)]
*  general who he may be losing the war, but he's going to fight to the last, a bitter ender. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1348.4s)]
*  And this is how they've been characterizing themselves, some of them. And AfriForum is [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1353.68s)]
*  part of that kind of attempt to rewrite history and make out that they're this minority that has [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1360.48s)]
*  long been persecuted, not just by the post-apartheid era, but by the British. And they have a long [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1367.52s)]
*  history. And apartheid was just a means of survival. All they were trying to do was to keep [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1372.4s)]
*  themselves and their culture alive. It has had one other effect, which they hadn't expected and [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1377.2800000000002s)]
*  has alarmed them, is that in all the orders that have been given out, canceling aid and agreements, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1383.2s)]
*  one of them affects agricultural products being imported to the United States, which have generally [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1392.0s)]
*  been duty-free as a means of helping Africa. One result is that their own products are no [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1396.56s)]
*  longer being imported duty-free into the United States. So these white South African farmers who've [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1402.0800000000002s)]
*  been complaining of oppression will now actually be being hit with tariffs or [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1408.56s)]
*  regular duties. And so it's going to cost them financially, which is one of the reasons [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1413.84s)]
*  they're so upset by it and pretending that it was nothing to do with them. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  AMY GOODMAN [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1420.96s)]
*  Guardian reporter Chris McGreal. He was the Johannesburg correspondent for The Guardian [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1422.08s)]
*  during the last years of apartheid through 2002. We did this interview in early February. Over the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1426.96s)]
*  past two months, Trump has suspended aid to South Africa, expelled the South African ambassador [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1433.44s)]
*  and offered refugee status to white South Africans, claiming South Africa is discriminating [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1438.8s)]
*  against the white minority. Trump has also just nominated Leo Brent Bozell to be U.S. ambassador [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1444.4s)]
*  in South Africa. Bozell's son was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for his role in the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahv3IKzMdHA&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
