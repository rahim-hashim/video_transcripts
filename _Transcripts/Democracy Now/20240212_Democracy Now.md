*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  It's wonderful to be back.
*  Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes killed at least 67 people in Raqqa overnight.
*  As fears grow, Israel will soon launch a ground invasion of a city where over one million
*  Palestinians have sought refuge.
*  The overnight airstrikes came as Israeli special forces raided a home in Raqqa in an
*  operation to free two Israeli Argentine hostages, 60-year-old Fernando Simon Memon and 70-year-old
*  Luis Ar.
*  They were both found to be in good condition after being held captive since October 7th.
*  On Sunday, President Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  The White House said Biden warned Netanyahu against a ground invasion of Raqqa unless
*  there's a, quote, credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety and support for
*  the more than one million people sheltering there, unquote.
*  Authorities in Egypt have threatened to suspend a key peace treaty with Israel if Raqqa is
*  invaded.
*  Hamas has also warned an Israeli invasion of Raqqa will torpedo ongoing truce talks.
*  The European Union also warned against a ground invasion of Raqqa, with one top EU
*  official saying it could lead to a, quote, unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe, unquote.
*  Israel carried out numerous airstrikes on Raqqa over the weekend, including one that
*  leveled a five-story home, killing at least eight people.
*  I am searching for my niece.
*  She was two months old.
*  My sister and her husband are sleeping in their room, and my mother and my other sister
*  with her children in the living room, me and my father in the room over here.
*  Suddenly, a rocket fell on us.
*  My sister, her husband and their children, including my niece, who is two months old,
*  all gone.
*  This all comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing pressure at home
*  to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.
*  Earlier today, a relative of the two Israeli-Argentine hostages, Fried and Rafa, called for Israel
*  to reach a deal now.
*  And we know about the discussions in Cairo or in Paris and others between the Hamas,
*  between Israeli, with the mediators.
*  Please be serious and strike a deal.
*  The Israeli people need the deal done.
*  Not yesterday, not tomorrow, today.
*  We want it done as soon as possible in order to give us some breath.
*  We must breathe a little bit here.
*  Hind Rajab, the six-year-old Gazan girl who had been missing for nearly two weeks, was
*  found dead on Saturday.
*  Relatives found Hind's body inside a car alongside the dead bodies of five of her family
*  members.
*  The bodies of two rescue workers who were attempting to reach Hind were also discovered.
*  Audio of Hind's harrowing call with emergency dispatchers was heard around the world as
*  the terrified girl begged for someone to come get her as an Israeli tank approached her.
*  The car where Hind was found was covered in bullet holes.
*  The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces also targeted its ambulance as it arrived
*  on the scene.
*  Emergency workers Yusuf Zeno and Ahmed Al-Madun had found their way to Hind, but it appeared
*  to have been killed by Israeli fire just yards from her vehicle.
*  This is Hind's mother, Wissam Hamada, after she learned of her daughter's killing.
*  My heart is completely destroyed over my daughter.
*  Two weeks.
*  They killed them.
*  Two weeks.
*  They were in that car.
*  I've told the world from day one, please go get Hind.
*  God is the only one sufficient for us.
*  Everyone failed us.
*  I will tell God on the Day of Judgment about my daughter.
*  I swear I will never forgive you or any human involved or any human rights organization.
*  A court in the Netherlands has ordered the Dutch government to stop exporting U.S.-made
*  F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel.
*  In the ruling, one of the judges wrote, quote,
*  It is undeniable that there's a clear risk that the exported F-35 parts are used in serious
*  violations of international humanitarian law, unquote.
*  In November, Oxfam and Amnesty International sued the Dutch government, saying the arms
*  transfers violated the Netherlands' obligations under international law to prevent war crimes.
*  One of President Biden's top foreign policy aides has admitted the administration has
*  made missteps in the Middle East.
*  During a closed-door meeting with Arab-American leaders in Michigan, Deputy National Security
*  Advisor Jonathan Feiner was recorded saying, quote,

*  since October 7th, unquote.
*  During the conversation, Feiner also said, quote,

*  month's Michigan primary due to Biden's support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Here in New York, hundreds of Palestinian rights activists occupied the Museum of Modern
*  Art Saturday, forcing the museum to close to the public.
*  Protesters unfurled massive banners and handed out mock-moma pamphlets, in which they called
*  out museum trustees for their investments in Israeli weaponry and other industries.
*  Another protest was organized outside the Brooklyn Museum.
*  The actions came as an open letter signed by over a hundred artists and other cultural

*  Disgraceful silence of our institutions as Israel commits genocide in Gaza, unquote.
*  In Providence, Rhode Island, Brown University students ended an eight-day long hunger strike

*  after being shot along with two friends in Burlington, Vermont, while they visited over
*  the Thanksgiving holiday.
*  Talks have resumed in Iraq that could result in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq
*  more than 20 years after the 2003 U.S. invasion.
*  The United States currently has about 2,500 soldiers in Iraq and another 900 troops in
*  Syria.
*  Calls for the troops to withdraw have increased after the U.S. carried out a number of deadly
*  drone attacks on militia groups in Baghdad.
*  In other military news, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been hospitalized again.

*  Former President Donald Trump is facing widespread criticism after saying he would encourage
*  Russia to attack NATO allies who pay too little money into the military alliance.
*  Trump made the comment during a campaign rally in South Carolina.
*  One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, well, sir, if we don't pay
*  and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*  I said, you didn't pay?
*  You're delinquent?
*  He said, yes.
*  Let's say that happened.
*  No, I would not protect you.
*  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*  You got to pay.
*  You got to pay your bills.
*  And the money came flowing in.
*  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued a statement in response to Trump's remarks,
*  quote, any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security,
*  including that of the U.S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk, he
*  said.
*  Finland held national elections Saturday.
*  The conservative former Prime Minister Alexander Stubb won the presidential election with over
*  51 percent of the vote.
*  It was Finland's first election since joining NATO.
*  In Pakistan, candidates affiliated with the jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan have
*  pulled off a major upset by winning 101 seats, more than any other party in last week's
*  election, even though Khan's PTI party was formally barred from running.
*  But the PTI-affiliated candidates fell short of winning a majority of seats, giving other
*  parties a chance to form a coalition government.
*  Senators of Khan accused the military of rigging Thursday's vote by taking drastic
*  actions including shutting down the country's cell phone service on Election Day.
*  Today's demonstration is a protest against the forces that have stolen the people's
*  mandate.
*  This is a protest against those forces that do not accept public opinion and think they
*  can impose their decision on the public.
*  U.N. officials estimate about 18 million people are facing emergency levels of hunger, a figure
*  that's doubled since last year due to months of fighting between the Sudanese Army and
*  the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
*  The humanitarian crisis has also triggered the world's largest displacement of children
*  ever seen in Sudan, with over 700,000 likely to suffer severe acute malnutrition, according
*  to UNICEF.
*  This is the agency's spokesperson, James Elder.
*  First, the world's largest displacement of children has been seen in Sudan.
*  Four million children have been displaced.
*  That's just over 13,000 children displaced every single day for the past 300 days.
*  Safety gone, worldly possessions gone, hope fading.
*  Second, the consequences of the past 300 days mean that more than 700,000 children are likely
*  to suffer the most dangerous form of malnutrition this year.
*  UNICEF won't be able to treat more than 300,000 of those without improved access and without
*  additional support.
*  In that case, tens of thousands would likely die.
*  Burma's ruling military junta has imposed mandatory military service for all young men
*  and women.
*  Under the new law, all men age 18 to 35 and women age 18 to 27 will be ordered to serve
*  for two years, though that can be extended to five years in the event of an ongoing
*  state of emergency.
*  This month marks three years since the military seized power in a 2021 coup and ousted elected
*  leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her party.
*  Earlier this month, Burma's UN ambassador appealed to the international community to
*  do more to help his country.
*  Last three years, over 44,000 people have been brutally killed by the military.
*  Over 86,000 civilian properties, including religious buildings, have been destroyed or
*  abandoned by the junta forces.
*  Almost 19 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
*  Half of the population has been thrown into poverty.
*  Meanwhile, Amnesty International is calling for a war crimes probe over the military bombing
*  of a church in the Burmese city of Zagayin in January, which killed 17 people, including
*  two children, who were attending a Sunday service.
*  Amnesty is urging the UN Security Council to refer the Burmese junta to the International
*  Criminal Court.
*  In news from Somalia, the militant group Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for an attack on
*  a military base in Mogadishu that killed four Emirati troops and a Bahraini military officer.
*  The foreign troops were at the base to train Somali soldiers in their fight against Al-Shabaab.
*  A jury in Washington, D.C., has awarded a million dollars to the climate scientist Michael
*  Mann, who had sued two right-wing critics for defamation.
*  In a statement, Mann said, quote,
*  I hope this verdict sends a message that falsely attacking climate scientists is not protected
*  speech, unquote.
*  And the city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $950,000 to a group of journalists who
*  were attacked by Minneapolis police while they covered protests over the police killing
*  of George Floyd.
*  In its lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota had accused police of tear-gassing
*  and pepper-spraying journalists, as well as shooting some journalists in the face with
*  hard foam bullets.
*  The ACLU said several journalists were arrested and threatened at gunpoint.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
