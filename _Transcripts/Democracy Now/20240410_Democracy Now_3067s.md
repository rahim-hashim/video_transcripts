Democracy Now! speaks with two former Israeli soldiers who are members of Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation group of Israeli army veterans. The group’s education director, Tal Sagi, describes growing up in a settlement and joining the military without understanding what occupation was. “We’ve been told that this is security and we have to control millions of lives and we don’t have other options,” says Sagi, who says Israeli society is not open to ending the occupation. “We’re trying to say that there are other options.” We also speak with Breaking the Silence deputy director Nadav Weiman about why the group is touring U.S. colleges and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. “We stood in checkpoints. We raided homes. We attacked Gaza from the air. We fought from the ground,” says Weiman. “So, when you bring reality, you bring real conversation about the occupation, and you bring real conversation about Gaza.”

# Breaking the Silence Israeli Army Veterans Tour U.S. & Canada to Speak Out Against Occupation
**Democracy Now:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUW7Ds4hWhM)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York with Juan González in Chicago.
*  The official death toll in Gaza has topped 33,400, including over 14,000 children with
*  over 76,000 people wounded.
*  Over 1.7 million Palestinians have been displaced, around 70 percent of Gaza's population,
*  while famine is setting in.
*  The International Court of Justice has ruled there's plausible case Israel's committing
*  genocide in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, violence by Israeli soldiers and settlers against Palestinians in the occupied
*  West Bank has also exploded, with over 450 Palestinians killed in the last six months
*  and at least 14 villages and towns forcibly depopulated.
*  Among those speaking out against the violence are Israeli soldiers themselves.
*  Breaking the Silence is an anti-occupation group led by veterans of the Israeli Army.
*  The group was founded in 2004, 20 years ago, in the aftermath of the Second Intifada.
*  We're joined right now by two members of Breaking the Silence.
*  Nadav Baiman is the group's deputy director.
*  He served in the West Bank and Gaza from 2005 to 2008.
*  And Tal Zaghi is the group's education director.
*  She served as a soldier in Hebron, one of the largest cities in the West Bank.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  Nadav, let's begin with you.
*  Why are you in the United States and then headed to Canada?
*  And your reaction as you listen to these numbers mounting in Gaza, where you were an Israeli
*  soldier, albeit many years ago, over 33,000 Palestinians dead?
*  Yeah, so we're over here to speak about what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank because
*  we believe that what is happening in the West Bank, it's not a secret that belongs to us
*  as soldiers.
*  It's something that the international community should know because the international community
*  is a part of it.
*  And we saw the discourse happening over here in the States about what is happening in Israel
*  and Palestine, and that's why we did a campus tour.
*  The last two weeks, Tal that was here with me spoke in a lot of campuses all around,
*  met a lot of students because the conversation about the occupation happens everywhere, right?
*  And we, as former soldiers, we want to be a part of it.
*  And saying supporting Israel, it's not supporting the occupation.
*  Supporting Israel is supporting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.
*  And Tal, talk about your experience in the military and why you chose to be a part of
*  breaking the silence.
*  And how many former Israeli soldiers, or even current ones, do you feel share your point
*  of view?
*  The occupation, I have to say, in the U.S. media is actually rarely talked about right now.
*  So it's not only here.
*  We're not talking about it either.
*  And actually, I grew up in a settlement in the West Bank, and I served in Hebron in the
*  West Bank.
*  And while serving, I was a tour guide.
*  I used to take groups of soldiers for tours in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.
*  And I didn't know what occupation is while taking these tours in this huge Palestinian
*  city surrounded by soldiers and their settlements in the middle of the city.
*  And I didn't know that the city is under military control while I'm taking part of
*  this military control while I'm a settler myself.
*  I didn't know where is the green line or what is the green line or anything about these
*  things.
*  So it took me a lot of time to realize that.
*  But the fact that I didn't know that is not a mistake.
*  We don't know these things.
*  As Israelis, we are not—we never thought these things, because, you know, it's something
*  that for years we're taking part of and we're doing.
*  And we don't want to stop controlling millions of lives of Palestinians for so many—we're
*  doing it for so many years, and we don't want to stop because we want to make sure
*  that we have the control over the land.
*  And we see now also how we don't have any other future.
*  That's all we get.
*  We've been told that this is security and we have to control millions of lives, and
*  we don't have other options.
*  And we're trying to say that there are other options.
*  But it's really hard to say to the Israeli society because we don't know that there
*  are other options.
*  And Tal, you said that you didn't know that you were participating in the occupation.
*  What were you taught in school in Israel about the Arabs and the Palestinians around you?
*  So I knew Palestinians from the other side of the fence.
*  The settlement I grew up in was surrounded by fences separating the settlement from the
*  Palestinian villages around us.
*  And I knew that they're not allowed to go into the settlement.
*  I knew that I can go into the Palestinian village.
*  And we never had any interaction, even though we lived so close to one another.
*  And I could see everything that is happening in the other side of the fence and hear everything
*  that is happening there.
*  And I knew that they are my enemies.
*  I knew that they all want to kill us.
*  That was the only thing I knew about Palestinians.
*  And also we call them Arabs.
*  Like they're all one big Arabs and like one big enemy.
*  So that was the only thing I knew about them.
*  And Nadav Viman, I wanted to ask you, what's been the reception that you've received on
*  the, especially in the college campuses, given the fact that any discussions about Israel
*  and Palestine have been so charged in recent months, not only the reception from the students,
*  but from the administrations at these various colleges?
*  You know, Nadav couldn't hear you, Juan, but Juan's question to you was, what is the
*  reception of the students and the administrators in all the college campuses?
*  You've organized this with J Street.
*  Talk about what kind of reception you've gotten.
*  Yeah, so it was quite interesting because our lecture managed to bring together Israeli
*  students that came to study here in the U.S., Jewish American students and also Palestinian
*  Americans.
*  And I think that when you speak about the reality firsthand, right, we did it.
*  We stood in checkpoints.
*  We raided homes.
*  We attacked Gaza from the air.
*  We fought from the ground.
*  So when you bring reality, you bring a real conversation about the occupation and you
*  conversation about Gaza.
*  So the responses were quite amazing.
*  There was really in-depth question and very interesting conversation around what is happening
*  now, but what the future holds for us.
*  And also very important, what the U.S. can do to stop the war at the moment and to release
*  our hostages and to enter as much humanitarian aid as possible to stop the humanitarian crisis
*  and the starvation in Gaza at the moment.
*  So the responses were very, very good, I've got to say.
*  So let me ask you about what has been the response since October 7th to breaking the
*  silence, your group of former soldiers in Israel speaking out on behalf of both of Palestinians
*  and those who are anti-occupation within Israel.
*  So from the very beginning of after October 7th, I've got to say October 7th was for
*  against the occupation was very hard.
*  You know, yes, I ran with my children and my wife to the shelter in Tel Aviv, but immediately
*  we start call to all of our testifiers, activists, donors in the Gaza envelope.
*  And eventually some of them didn't answer.
*  And two of them were murdered on October 7th.
*  And one of them was a very good friend of mine.
*  And this is how we started, right?
*  The blood was boiling.
*  Everybody was angry.
*  But then on October 8th, we became a revenge army and we started to do and we started the
*  airstrikes in Gaza.
*  And of course, that we're breaking the silence, we know how it works, right?
*  We know how airstrike looks like.
*  We know how fighting in Gaza looks like.
*  So after a couple of weeks, we and other NGOs in Israel, we called for ceasefire, to release
*  our hostages, to enter humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*  And obviously, obviously the right wing in Israel is against it because the right wing
*  in Israel believes that we need to continue fighting.
*  And I don't even understand the goals of the fighting now in Gaza.
*  I think the number one goal is to release our hostages.
*  So yes, there was some aggression against breaking the silence.
*  But in a couple of months, we will publish our report with the hundreds of testifiers
*  that will come to us.
*  Then we expect another wave of violence.
*  I wanted to go to Tal Mitnick.
*  In January, the 18-year-old who refused Israeli military service was sentenced to 30 days
*  in a military prison.
*  Democracy Now! spoke with Tal after he was released about what he witnessed while incarcerated.
*  He then went right back into prison.
*  Actually, inside prison, the only source of news that we got was one newspaper called
*  Israel Ayom.
*  And every day on the newspaper, there will be pictures of the soldiers that died.
*  And I remember feeling like I feel sad, very sad for the soldiers and the families that
*  have to take this great burden of losing someone close to them.
*  But I know that while seeing soldiers dying, I know that this means that there are much
*  more Palestinian civilians dying, which we don't see in the newspaper.
*  Who else are you serving time with in that prison?
*  Who else is there?
*  Sadly, a lot of the other people there are deserters, which means that they serve time
*  in the military, and then at some point, for some reason, they went back home and did not
*  come back.
*  Most of these people desert because of socioeconomic reasons.
*  If it's having to take care of their siblings or go work for their family, and when they
*  come back and turn themselves in, we're now seeing a very heavy sentencing of those
*  deserters as a part of the fascist persecution and the fog of war.
*  People that went to work for three months to feed their family are now being sentenced
*  to half a year in military prison.
*  So that was Tal Mitnick, 18 years old.
*  He's been sentenced and sentenced again to military prison.
*  How common is it for a soldier to say no, or a fuznik, as you call them?
*  Not common at all.
*  I served in the Israeli Special Forces.
*  We were 12 in my team.
*  I served in a sniper's team.
*  And standing in front of your friends in mid-operation or before operation and say, hey, no, we have
*  to stop, because it's against the Fourth Geneva Convention or it's against international
*  human law, it really doesn't happen.
*  Because a unit, it doesn't matter if it's a platoon, a company or a team, it's a family.
*  And standing in front of your family members, your brother, saying no, it is very hard,
*  these young men that did it before his Army service, I think it's quite unique in the
*  Israeli society.
*  We have a couple of those each year, but the general soldiers and general public, they
*  go to the Army as they were requested by the State of Israel.
*  And, Nadav Viman, you served in the IDF in both Gaza and the West Bank.
*  Could you talk about your experiences there and how that shaped your views of the occupation?
*  Yeah.
*  So, I served between 2005 to 2008 in a Special Forces unit.
*  And me and my team served just after the Second Interfada.
*  But when the IDF really pressured the Palestinian population like we are in the Second Interfada,
*  so we arrested a lot of people, we searched for all kinds of things, but mainly we did
*  sniping operations.
*  Now, when you want to do sniping operations inside Palestinian cities or villages, you
*  don't have a hill or a forest to take cover in.
*  So, what we used to do, it's something that is called straw widow.
*  It's a code name in the IDF of taking a private Palestinian family's house and turn it into
*  a military post.
*  You choose a house that looks best for you.
*  Maybe it's tall, maybe it has big windows.
*  Then you call the shin bet.
*  You make sure that every one of the family members are innocent, are not connected to
*  terror.
*  And then, in the middle of the night, you come, you sneak into the neighborhood, you
*  break the door down, you grab everybody from their bed because then they cannot really
*  resist you, put them in one room, and then use one of the rooms, the parents' bedroom,
*  for example, as our sniping post.
*  We put our sniping rifles.
*  And after that, if one of the family members wants to eat, they want to drink, they want
*  to take medicine, they want to pray, they need authorization from us because it's our
*  house.
*  And then you shoot from their houses.
*  The minute you do that, the armed convoy comes and you go back to the base.
*  But that's the West Bank.
*  In Gaza, when I did the same thing, straw widows in Gaza in 2008, you don't infiltrate, you
*  don't do it quietly in the middle of the night.
*  When we approach the houses, the first row of houses of Gaza, after cutting the fence
*  and walking over there, a tank came and rammed one of the walls of the house and knocked
*  it down because they told us that every house in Gaza is booby-trapped.
*  And then when we got inside the house, we took all of the men from 16-year-old until
*  80-years-old and we put them on a truck, drove them back to Israel for interrogation.
*  And then when we put our sniping rifles on the rooftop, we saw there was lots of new
*  greenhouses that we didn't saw in the aerial photograph.
*  So we called the D9 bulldozer that smashed everything down so we will have a clean line
*  of fire.
*  And I think that's the difference between the ongoing occupation with settlements and
*  West Bank and the occupation by siege that we have in Gaza since 2007 and the level of
*  brutality or firepower that we use over there.
*  President Biden's leveled some of his harshest criticism against Israel as the death toll
*  in Gaza tops 33,300.
*  In an interview with the network Univision, Biden directly criticized Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's killing of the seven aid workers from the World Central
*  Kitchen last week.
*  I think what he's doing is a mistake.
*  I don't agree with his approach.
*  I think it's outrageous that those four or three vehicles were hit by drones and taken
*  out on a highway where it wasn't like it was along the shore, it wasn't like there
*  was a convoy moving here, et cetera.
*  What I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the
*  next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going into the country.
*  Biden's comments were made a week ago, but only aired on Univision on Tuesday.
*  Palestinians in Gaza are marking the end of Ramadan as Israel continues its assault.
*  Officials in Gaza say at least 14 Palestinians, including four children, have died in Israeli
*  strikes in the Nusadat refugee camp.
*  On Monday, Israel assassinated the mayor of the Al Maghazi refugee camp.
*  Hamas accused Israel of committing a war crime.
*  The Israeli Occupations Army committed a crime yesterday with the assassination of Al Maghazi
*  municipal chief Hatem Salah al-Ghomri.
*  He's known as a civilian, a municipal head, who provides municipal services since the
*  first day of this war, this genocide against civilians in civil sectors.
*  The Israeli Occupations Army purposefully targeted al-Ghomri, even though they are fully
*  aware that he's a civil servant and only works within that framework at Al Maghazi
*  refugee camp.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill in the United States, about 50 protesters were arrested Tuesday
*  when they blocked access to the Senate cafeteria, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Today we continue with Part 2 of our conversation with two former Israeli soldiers, members
*  of the group Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation group led by veterans of the Israeli army,
*  the group founded 20 years ago in the aftermath of the Second Intifada.
*  We're joined by two members.
*  Nadav Weiman is the group's deputy director.
*  He served in the West Bank in Gaza from 2005 to 2008.
*  And Tal Sagi is the group's education director.
*  She served as a soldier in Hebron, one of the largest cities in the West Bank.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  I wanted to ask you, Tal, about Hebron and about what it was like for you to go there.
*  Hebron in Hebrew, al-Khalil in Arabic, has a few hundred Jewish settlers and 33,000 Palestinians
*  living there.
*  The streets of Palestinians can walk down, and there are streets that they can't walk
*  down, checkpoints everywhere.
*  Can you describe your revelation when you got there, what you thought about this city
*  and what you experienced and led you to Breaking the Silence?
*  Tal Sagi So I grew up in a settlement.
*  I was really used to see separation around me from a young age.
*  I used to see the soldiers patrolling my neighborhood 24-7 with military vehicles.
*  I used to see the fences separating the settlement from the Palestinian villages around us.
*  Separation wasn't something that I asked questions about.
*  It was normal.
*  It was my day-to-day.
*  When I got to Hebron, to Hebron as a soldier in 2012, things there looked normal to me.
*  I never asked any questions about the situation there.
*  And my job there was to be a tour guide.
*  As part of the job, I used to also work together with the settlers of Hebron, so we had that
*  connection.
*  And I learned from them a lot about the situation around me.
*  And it took me years to realize that this city is under military control.
*  And I realized that only when I came back after my service, after a few years with Breaking
*  the Silence, and suddenly I saw the city as it is, as a huge Palestinian city, the second
*  largest Palestinian city in the West Bank, and the levels of separation and control that
*  we have as military over that city.
*  But it's something that was totally invisible to me during my service.
*  I was—I thought it's normal.
*  So what was your turning point?
*  I think this tour was for me life-changing, because I realized that there are so many
*  things that my parents, my teacher, the Israeli society never talked to me about, and that
*  there is this gap between reality and what I see around me.
*  And like, I thought all of these things are normal, and I never thought about the separation
*  as something that is oppressive.
*  And it took me years to manage to see the Palestinian population and the cost that we
*  and Palestinians are paying for this military control for so many years.
*  So how have your family and community responded in the settlement where you live to your activism?
*  So most of them are still nice to me, but it was pretty tough with my family at the
*  beginning.
*  There's a lot of arguments around this, and some of them are not agreeing to what
*  I do.
*  But today, most of them are pretty supportive, and we have also, like, really respectful
*  conversation about the situation.
*  But it's not easy, definitely, after 7th of October, when I hear some voices around
*  my family and my friends, and I want to say that the situation is not promoting security
*  for us.
*  What we're doing in Gaza is not for a better future.
*  It's just taking us to a worse place.
*  And when I hear what other people are saying around me, it's really sad.
*  Nadav, you have been with Breaking the Silence for how long?
*  Twelve years now.
*  And can you talk about how it's grown?
*  Yeah, so when I joined the organization, we were seven employees, and now we are about
*  30 employees.
*  We to this day, in a normal year, we do 700 education events a year.
*  We bring about 18,000 people to the ground, to the West Bank, to the city of Hebron or
*  to the south of the Nehiles area.
*  We meet military academies and youth movement and kibbutzes and high schools and open public
*  and Jewish congregations.
*  But we work also with diplomats and politicians and Israeli journalists and international
*  journalists.
*  We do a lot, a lot of things.
*  And the steady flow of testifiers continues all of the time.
*  And during times like this, when we have war in Gaza, we even have more testifiers.
*  In the last few weeks, we have two or three new testifiers each week.
*  And the flow is going to get bigger and bigger, as you have more and more idea for service
*  being released from active duty in the Gaza Strip.
*  So when we engage with Israelis or with international, we do basically the same thing, political
*  education.
*  We want to educate people how the occupation really works.
*  How many members do you have in Breaking the Silence?
*  We have a little bit over 1,400 testifiers from all of the different units that serve
*  in the West Bank and Gaza.
*  We don't collect testimonies from the Shin Bet or the Intelligence Corps.
*  That's military intelligence.
*  Exactly.
*  Because we don't want to harm Israel's security, right?
*  We believe that the IDF should be with us and defend Israel, but to defend Israel, not
*  to occupy the Palestinian people, that's not defending Israel.
*  That's control.
*  So, in the first part of our discussion, you gave a very chilling description of what you
*  would do in the West Bank and also when you were serving as a soldier in Gaza.
*  I wanted to ask you about the 972 local call expose by the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham,
*  who exposed how the Israeli military used an artificial intelligence program known as
*  Lavender to develop a kill list in Gaza that includes as many as 37,000 Palestinians targeted
*  for assassination with little human oversight.
*  A second AI program known as Where's Daddy tracked Palestinians on the kill list and
*  was purposely designed to help Israel target individuals when they were at home at night
*  with their families.
*  This targeting system is combined with an extremely permissive, so to speak, bombing
*  policy in the Israeli military, led to, quote, entire Palestinian families being wiped out
*  inside their houses.
*  I probably don't have to tell you this, so I'm wondering if you can—did this
*  surprise you?
*  Did you use anything like this when you were in the military or talk to testifiers or people
*  within the military now who are doing this?
*  Yes, so first of all, I've got to say that it's one of the most important exposures
*  by an Israeli journalist from the beginning of this war.
*  The Israeli media, most of it, are not really being critical about what we do over there,
*  and Yuval did an amazing work.
*  Now, our testifiers that came from Gaza didn't talk about this yet, and when we will have
*  testimonies in the next couple of weeks or months, we can talk extensively about that.
*  But I can tell you that our former testifiers from former operations told us about the target
*  bank, right?
*  And those targets were supposed to get inside the target bank.
*  Now, the target bank that the IDF has about Gaza, it is huge.
*  It is huge.
*  One of our testifiers from just now said to me that when you open the computer with the
*  grid of all of the targets in Gaza, it takes the computer some minutes to upload everything
*  because basically every house in Gaza, it could be a target.
*  Now, we know from our testifiers that, for example, a house could be a target if there
*  was an operation room of Hamas or they had ammunition over there or there's a tunnel.
*  But also we know that Hamas is moving ammunition from house to house every time.
*  But a house that was designated as a target of ammunition depot, it will stay like that
*  even if the ammunition was moved.
*  And if there's 50 grenades or 50 missiles, it is the same target.
*  And I think there's a difference between 50 grenades and 50 missiles.
*  Another target that you have over there, it's houses of Hamas operatives, their personal
*  house.
*  Now, you know, when I was a soldier, I don't think my family was to blame for what they
*  did.
*  It's what they did, right?
*  And we don't think civilians living close to Hamas operatives supposed to be hit in
*  the middle of the night by an airstrike.
*  Another thing that we have over there, it's government offices, it's water facilities,
*  it's bridges and towns and tunnels and everything that you and I consider the civilian infrastructure
*  that we see as legitimate, the IDFCs as legitimate military targets.
*  Now, if you combine all of this with what Yuval just published, you can understand why
*  you have this amount of death toll, right?
*  Twelve thousand Palestinian kids died.
*  Like, 33,000 Palestinians died.
*  The IDF is talking about something like between 12 and 15,000 Hamas militants that we killed.
*  And I'm not sure about those numbers.
*  We have very important testimonies from 2014 war on Gaza, that the soldier told us that
*  they saw two females walking in an orchard 400 meters from IDF forces, and they were
*  talking on the phone.
*  And that's why they were designated as spotters.
*  The only option to shoot from the air or from the ground at unarmed Palestinians.
*  A drone was directed to them, shot and killed them both.
*  And then the IDF sent two tanks.
*  The tanks came, and they saw they were unarmed.
*  But, because we shot at them, they were listed as terrorists.
*  And so, the amount of casualties that the IDF is talking about, I'm not sure about
*  that number.
*  But for sure, we are harming civilians knowingly.
*  I don't know if intentionally, but knowingly we are killing a lot of civilians.
*  What's the difference between knowingly and intentionally?
*  Intentionally is when you fire a missile and you want to kill 100 civilians to, I don't
*  know, make a point or something like that.
*  But for example, we have something that is called collateral damage.
*  We have a certain commander in Hamas.
*  So you know that if you will shoot him, there would be five or ten members of his family's
*  collateral damage.
*  And then the IDF sits down and thinks if it's OK or not.
*  Now, what we know from our testifiers is that the equation that sees how many Palestinians
*  are inside a certain house is not being changed when operation starts.
*  We know in Jabal refugee camp there are, I don't know, this amount of people, and the
*  apartment is 40 square meters.
*  So there's five people, or I don't know, six people inside.
*  But as you said, we have millions of refugees now inside the Gaza Strip.
*  So we don't know how many people would be affected.
*  And in this operation, we saw collateral damage jump to numbers that we didn't know.
*  When we killed the Jabalia regiment commander, the first couple of weeks of this war, according
*  to international media, we killed 126 civilians with him.
*  And that's something that we never saw in formal operation, and it's considered to
*  be a low-ranking target than the target that you used to attack with a lot of collateral
*  damage.
*  And Yuval Abraham exposed that they didn't want to take out Hamas operatives in their
*  military buildings or in their offices, that they waited for them to go home at night where
*  there would be families that were killed.
*  We have a testifier from the former operation that told us that the IDF doesn't want them
*  to have houses to come back to, and that's why we are firing into civilian population
*  or into their houses.
*  But what you describe, it's a different case, right?
*  And I've got to say that the IDF also has all kinds of tools to make sure that we won't
*  have civilians inside the house.
*  First of all, it's what the IDF call roof knocking.
*  When you throw a small bomb, a missile, but a small bomb on the roof, and then Palestinians
*  should understand that they should leave the house before the big bomb would come.
*  Now, during a war in Gaza, you have bombings all around.
*  Another method is sending SMS.
*  It's sending messages or calling the families, telling them to leave.
*  But that is only when the house is a target, right?
*  When the house is an Amos depot or something like that.
*  But when there's a human being inside the target, so you shoot, like Yuval described.
*  So, there was a group in World War II called the White Rose Collective in Germany.
*  They were Christians.
*  They weren't Jewish.
*  Hans and Sophie Scholl, famous.
*  He was a medical student.
*  Her sister Sophie was an undergraduate.
*  And they thought, what can we do in the face of the Nazi atrocity?
*  And they decided just to get out information so that Germans would never be able to say
*  they didn't know.
*  How much do you think, Tal, Israeli society understands about what's going on?
*  I mean, even in the United States, even with Netanyahu preventing international journalists
*  getting from Gaza, we see all sorts of images, even if it's not on the networks, of casualties.
*  What about Israel?
*  We're talking about 15 minutes away, 30 minutes away.
*  I think there are a few levels of not knowing.
*  And, of course, there is the media.
*  And in Israeli media, we don't see the stories of the Palestinians.
*  We don't meet these stories.
*  We don't see the amount of casualties and the bodies.
*  We don't see these images.
*  But there is also years of not knowing and ignoring and indifference to the situation
*  of the Palestinians.
*  And the dehumanization that we have in our society because of the occupation.
*  And it's the fact that we're being told that they're only this enemy.
*  And then, you know, October 7th happening, and we lost so many people.
*  And people are hostages.
*  And in the society, it's like a shock because, like, we used to ignore the situation, and
*  suddenly these things happened.
*  And we just want to be with ourselves.
*  And that's a human reaction, you know.
*  We want to deal with our suffering, with our mourning, and make sure that, you know, we're
*  and we support each other and we're safe.
*  And the reaction is like we don't care about the reaction.
*  And we don't see what is the reaction.
*  We don't want to see, like—
*  Would any number change Israeli society?
*  We're talking about what we know, more than 33,000 people killed, 14,000 children, overwhelmingly
*  civilian, 40,000, 50,000.
*  I mean, that may be the number, considering how many people are under the rubble.
*  What would break through?
*  I don't think people understand necessarily numbers.
*  I think—I hear from people around me that they don't have capacity to look to the
*  suffering of Palestinians right now because people are occupied with their suffering.
*  And also, what we hear from the government all the time is, winning, we want to win,
*  we want this total win.
*  And people want to feel that, you know, we won, that we are safe, even though we know
*  that we're not changing anything.
*  Well, let me ask, Nadeav, what do you think Netanyahu wants to accomplish here, just simply
*  staying out of jail for corruption charges?
*  And if he remains prime minister, he will?
*  And if he goes against Ben-Gavir, the settlers Ben-Gavir and Smotrik, they'll leave him,
*  and he won't be protected by his prime ministership anymore?
*  Yeah, so, when we started this war, it was a very justified war, but very quickly it
*  became a war without goals or a war to keeping Benjamin Netanyahu in his seat, because now,
*  I'm sure you saw in the last couple of months, there wasn't really a war, right?
*  There wasn't really operations over there.
*  And soldiers coming out said the same thing.
*  I was in a protest in Tel Aviv.
*  I saw a soldier holding a sign.
*  Why did I fight in Gaza for Benjamin Netanyahu?
*  That was the sign he held.
*  And yes, it looks like our government is trying to stop any deal to release our hostages,
*  the most important thing that we can do at the moment.
*  And it's because the extremists in the government, that it's the government, are against it.
*  I'm driving in the West Bank all of the time.
*  And since the beginning of this war in Tel Aviv, in Haifa, in Jerusalem, everywhere, we
*  see signs, the faces of the hostage Israelis.
*  In every cafe in Tel Aviv, you have a yellow chair, right, yellow color, to remember our
*  abducted Israelis.
*  In the West Bank, you hardly see it, because they don't believe in a deal.
*  They think it's collateral damage, our hostages.
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu is bound to the extremists in his government, right, because he knows
*  that if it would be a deal and we release our citizens, they would get out of the government.
*  And he wants to sit over there, because he has the trials.
*  So he thinks about himself more than the citizens of Israel.
*  And that's why, for a lot of reasons, we need the U.S. government with us, right?
*  We need the U.S. government to pressure Israel to do so.
*  And what would it mean?
*  How would they do it?
*  How do you think it's most effective to do that?
*  Now, when I was a soldier, I had an M4.
*  And it was engraved on my weapon, property of U.S. government.
*  The U.S. government has a lot of responsibility about the occupation, West Bank and Gaza,
*  and about this war.
*  And in the last few weeks, we saw very important steps of Joe Biden's administration, first
*  of all imposing sanctions on violent settlers and then putting very clear red lines to our
*  government about entering humanitarian aid inside or even attacks from there after the
*  killing of the seven World Center Kitchen employees.
*  But we need to see something a lot more immediate and a lot more powerful in front of the Israeli
*  government, because ceasefire, it's something that should happen months ago, not tomorrow,
*  not two hours from now, months ago.
*  And we want the government—you know, the most important country for Israel in the world
*  is the U.S. government, because we really have shared values.
*  And because of that, we want the Biden administration to help us to stop the war and release our
*  and immediately enter humanitarian aid into Gaza, because the starvation in Gaza, it could
*  not be used as a weapon against Palestinians.
*  You both have been going to college campuses.
*  You see the number of people who are speaking up for Palestinian rights, Muslim, Jewish,
*  Christian.
*  But there's also a real crackdown on campus.
*  Groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, like Students for Justice in Palestine, are being banned
*  across the country.
*  What is your reaction to this?
*  And have any of your events been canceled on campuses?
*  Here you are, former Israeli soldiers.
*  So, I believe that pro-Palestine or pro-Israel, it's the same thing, because for me pro-Israel
*  is anti-occupation and pro-peace, right?
*  And of course everybody has a right to speak.
*  And I think the conversation should be a diverse conversation.
*  So silencing voices that are against our war in Gaza, that's not democratic at all.
*  I heard from now, we met quite a few Jewish congregations over here in the States, and
*  yes, there is a new wave of anti-Semitism.
*  I don't want criticism against Israel would be actually anti-Semitism, right?
*  Anti-Semitism, it's something that we have to fight against.
*  Our government, by the way, is not helping by labeling any criticism against Israel as
*  anti-Semitism.
*  That's not right.
*  I think Tal can elaborate more about what happened in campuses, but again, we were very
*  surprised by the very good reactions.
*  Tal, what about what's happened?
*  So none of our events got canceled, not that I know of.
*  Everything happened as planned.
*  And as Nadav said, the reactions were really good.
*  A lot of people came.
*  We met a few hundreds of students.
*  People were really curious, wanted to know, asked questions, asked about what the Israeli
*  society are now, where the Israeli society are now.
*  And it was really nice to see Jewish students sitting together with pro-Palestinian students
*  and having this conversation.
*  And people thanked us at the end of the events.
*  And I hope that we managed to bring this complex message that it's not that you're pro-Israel
*  or pro-Palestin.
*  When you want to help really Palestinians, you have to stand together in solidarity with
*  Israelis who see the situation and who wants to change the situation.
*  And in that sense, the help that we need from students and from people all around the world
*  is to see that there are voices who want to change these things inside the Israeli society,
*  inside the Palestinian society, and these voices we need to support, the voices of solidarity.
*  You two are both soldiers.
*  Nadav, you're talking about defending the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, defending
*  Israelis.
*  But knowing what you know, are you at all sympathetic to Palestinian resistance fighters,
*  feeling they are doing exactly the same thing for Palestinians?
*  Yeah, when I was a soldier—so, I finished training in 2006, and the first thing that
*  we did, we were sent to Jenin, to the refugee camp in Jenin for an operation.
*  As a member of the Special Forces, you were waiting for things like that.
*  But when we break down the door in the middle of the night, I found a family.
*  I found kids.
*  I found a grandmother and a grandfather and two parents inside the house.
*  And very quickly, you start to understand that what you are doing over there is, yes,
*  you fight terror in a very small portion of the time, but the majority of the time you're
*  a police officer.
*  You are maintaining military law over Palestinians.
*  We arrested a lot of people that their crime was that they were cousins of somebody that
*  we wanted.
*  It's called pressure arrests, or we did mass arrests.
*  Mass arrests, it's to take the whole logic of arrest and put it on its head, because
*  you come to a village and you arrest everybody from 16 years old to 60 years old, and then
*  you question all of them.
*  And when you do that, all of the Palestinians, they look at you with a mixture of fear and
*  hate.
*  And I told myself, oh, yeah, they hate me because I'm Jewish.
*  And then, when I finished my army service and started thinking as a civilian, I understand
*  that they hate me because I was an occupying soldier.
*  And when I joined Breaking the Silence, one of the first things that I did was to drive
*  into Hebron and meet our Palestinian partner, drinking tea with them.
*  And I was sitting with Issa Ambron, he's a very prominent human rights activist from
*  Hebron, in his house.
*  We were drinking tea, and I was looking.
*  You know, where's the door?
*  Where's the window?
*  Like I was trained to do.
*  And Issa told me, Radav, come, we're friends.
*  We're drinking tea together.
*  We were talking.
*  We talked about football.
*  It was very nice.
*  And when you understand Palestinians are human beings just like me and you, and have desires
*  and hopes and dreams and families and all of that, you understand that they want freedom
*  just like me and you.
*  And you know, I think about my grandfather and grandmother that fought the British for
*  our independence.
*  And I think, yes, there is a legitimate fight between armed men or women, right, with uniform
*  or not, but armed.
*  Civilians are out of the way, right?
*  We are not supposed to harm civilians.
*  My unit commander in the special forces told us, listen, stabbing an Israeli soldier is
*  a terror attack.
*  It's an attack.
*  Stabbing an Israeli citizen, a settler, that's a terror attack.
*  Doesn't matter what happened, we have to protect Israelis and fight them, right?
*  You have a weapon on you.
*  You have to fight.
*  And he was an extreme right-wing settler, by the way.
*  And he explained to me what is terror and what is not terror.
*  And I think that's what we need to put—when we look at now this war on Gaza, maybe—not
*  maybe.
*  It's very clear that we can attack Hamas that are kidnapping and firing at us, yes,
*  but civilians are out of the question, period.
*  Nadezhda, there have been over 8,000 arrests of Palestinians on the West Bank, only since
*  October 7th.
*  Is that to get this massive number so when there's a prisoner exchange they have many
*  people that they're willing to exchange?
*  Could be, but usually when we have operation in Gaza or operation in the West Bank and
*  all of the eyes of the world are on Gaza or on the West Bank, the IDF uses the other territory
*  to do a lot of things like mass arrests or shooting and all of that.
*  But you have something very different in the IDF since October 7th.
*  After October 7th, all of the on-duty soldiers, 19-, 20-year-old soldiers, were sent down
*  to the south to fight Hamas or up to the north to fight Hezbollah.
*  And the regular reserve unit, the same.
*  So the IDF uses a special reserve unit.
*  It's called haqmar in Hebrew, original defense in English, which means that settlers are
*  doing the reserve duty in their settlements.
*  Okay, so we have very ideological settlers.
*  Some of them believe in Jewish supremacy that now have IDF uniform and a weapon.
*  They amend the checkpoint.
*  They enter Palestinian homes and all of that.
*  And we saw an increased violence from IDF soldiers towards Palestinians since October 7th.
*  And it's settlers with IDF uniform.
*  And that's why the Israeli government said, listen, since October 7th we have a decrease
*  in settler violence.
*  And it's true, because now they have uniform.
*  And I drive around with diplomats or with journalists in the West Bank in the last couple
*  of months, and you get stopped in the middle of the street by soldiers.
*  But some of them have half-uniform, only a shirt, only pants, only a vest.
*  And you don't know if it's settlers or if it's settlers in the army.
*  Or everything is very unclear.
*  And that leads to a lot of violence.
*  We have a lot of videos in recent months.
*  You see IDF soldiers entering Palestinian villages or even cave dwellers' villages in the South
*  Eboniils area, saying that they came to find lost ships of a settler herd or something
*  like that, and a lot of violence.
*  And also we see settlers taking bulldozers, blocking Palestinian villages with stones
*  and rubble because they can.
*  Right?
*  So—
*  Because all the attention is on Gaza?
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  And then what happened?
*  One of those settlers that has a bulldozer is Inon Levy.
*  And he was the first settler that the U.S. government imposed sanctions on him.
*  Right?
*  And why he got sanctioned on his head?
*  Because there wasn't an investigation against him by Judean-Sumeria police or by the Israeli
*  army, because we didn't do anything in front of those settlers.
*  And what is the feeling towards Smotrik and Ben-Gavir Tal, these extremist Jewish settlers
*  from the West Bank?
*  I think it's mixed, because there are a lot of criticism now against the government,
*  because they're not doing enough in order to bring back the hostages, and the protests
*  are growing and growing every week.
*  So people are not very happy with them dealing—saying all these things like resettle Gaza, dealing
*  with take more money from the budget, from the government to the settlements, and not
*  helping the families of the hostages and taking care of people who have no home since 7th
*  of October.
*  But there are some sectors in the society that are supporting these ideologies and supporting
*  the idea of going back to settle in Gaza.
*  And people also are talking about transferring all Palestinians out of Gaza and things that
*  I hear from people around me.
*  These ideas are popular in some sectors of Israeli society.
*  And the effect on settlers like your from a settlement, when they hear about sanctioning
*  of settlers by governments like the United States?
*  So I think some of them are worried that it will get to them.
*  And we see the reaction also in the government immediately after the sanctions.
*  They did this committee talking about activists who are documenting this violence and talking
*  about them as anarchists trying to prevent them from documenting the violence.
*  These are Israeli, Jewish, what they call anarchist activists who are going into the
*  West Bank to document what the settlers are doing.
*  Together with the Palestinian activists on ground, yeah.
*  And we also see that they are trying to hide the violence.
*  I was a few weeks ago in Hebron, and the police and the soldiers didn't allow us to go into
*  the city.
*  And then I realized that settlers were protesting outside of the mosque trying to prevent prayers
*  to go to pray inside the mosque on the first Friday of Ramadan.
*  And the fact that they didn't allow us to go in was like—after that, I realized it
*  was really clear they didn't want us to document the protest.
*  And actually, most of—like, we didn't—we almost don't have any documentation of that.
*  And they managed to prevent prayers to go into the mosque and pray on the first Friday
*  of Ramadan.
*  And there is no documentation.
*  They block every activist who are trying to go there and document this violence.
*  Would you say, Nadav, that what we're seeing on the West Bank and Gaza is apartheid?
*  As Yuval Abraham said in his speech when he won Best Documentary as part of an Israeli-Palestinian
*  collective for the film No Other Land, talked about the system of apartheid that Palestinians
*  live under in Israel and the occupied territories?
*  So, as a soldier, they taught me that I'm not allowed to touch settlers.
*  If I see a violent settler cutting down olive trees, burning a mosque, beating Palestinians,
*  I'm not allowed.
*  The only one who can do so are police.
*  To the end, Somali police.
*  It's not even the Israeli police, because it does have jurisdiction over there.
*  But there is the military law that I have to enforce on Palestinians all of the time,
*  that I can arrest, I can shoot, I can detain, I can do whatever I want.
*  Very quickly, you understand that there are two separate law systems in the West Bank,
*  the Israeli law system for Israelis and the military law system for Palestinians in the
*  same piece of land, with human beings, with two nostrils, two eyes, two heart, one heart,
*  and all of that.
*  But it matters only your nationality.
*  Based on your nationality, this would be the law enforcement's on you.
*  And yes, there's a name for that, right?
*  And that's why, by the way, the right-wing and the settler movement, they want to annex
*  the West Bank into Israel, because if they will do that, then Israel would be an apartheid
*  state.
*  Now, maybe you are committing the crime of apartheid in the West Bank, but if they will
*  annex, we will be an apartheid state, and that has international repercussions for that.
*  But would you say it's apartheid right now?
*  What is happening with two separate law systems?
*  Yes.
*  I want to thank you both for being with us.
*  You're headed to the Canadian Parliament, to Canada?
*  Are you going to address the Canadian Parliament?
*  No, we're going to meet Jewish congregations in Canada, and we'll have some meetings
*  because we want to convey our messages about how the idea fights in Gaza to every important
*  actor around the world.
*  I want to thank you both.
*  Nadav Viman is the deputy director of Breaking the Silence, and I want to thank as well Tal
*  Sagi, education director of Breaking the Silence, an Israeli anti-occupation group of former
*  soldiers.
*  They're here in the United States.
*  To see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Thanks for joining us.
