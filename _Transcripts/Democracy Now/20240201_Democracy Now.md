*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Palestinian officials are accusing Israeli forces of carrying out execution-style killings
*  in Gaza after the discovery of a mass grave containing at least 30 decomposing bodies.
*  Some of the victims were blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs with zip
*  ties.
*  The bodies were found on the grounds of a school in Beit Lachia.
*  Al Jazeera spoke to one man who helped discover the bodies.
*  Inside the schoolyard, we were shocked to find the dead bodies.

*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also headed back to Israel in the coming days.
*  In more news on Gaza, South Africa's foreign minister Naledi Pandur has called on all nations
*  to halt military support to Israel after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel
*  last week to prevent genocide in Gaza.
*  Pandur spoke in Pretoria, South Africa.
*  In related news, a U.S. federal court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a group of Palestinian
*  Americans against President Biden and other officials for failing to prevent genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  The court dismissed the suit on jurisdictional grounds but ruled it's plausible Israel's
*  engaging in genocide.
*  In its ruling, the court wrote, the evidence and testimony presented, quote, indicate the
*  ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people and therefore
*  falls within the international prohibition against genocide, unquote.
*  The lawsuit had been brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights.
*  Visit democracynow.org to see our coverage of the case.
*  U.S. forces have bombed Yemen again.

*  for war, unquote.

*  The Chicago City Council narrowly voted Wednesday to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire
*  in Gaza.

*  the measure.
*  Reverend Jesse Jackson was also present to show his support.
*  At least 47 U.S. cities have passed resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, another Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, vetoed a city council resolution
*  calling for a ceasefire that was passed last week.
*  Frey said the measure was too one-sided in favor of Palestinians and that he is open
*  to signing a ceasefire resolution that's more, quote, unquote, unifying.
*  The resolution was passed with a veto-proof majority, so councilmembers could still decide
*  to override the mayor's veto.
*  Protests against the U.S.-funded war in Gaza continue across the United States.
*  Activists have been camped outside the Virginia home of Secretary of State Antony Blinken
*  for a week, loudly chanting slogans through megaphones like Secretary of Genocide and

*  against President Biden ahead of his visit today to the key swing state and just weeks
*  ahead of Michigan's February 27th presidential primary.
*  I voted for Bernie Sanders, which tells you where I was on the spectrum.
*  To have a person like me to go from that extreme, to say that I'm now willing to vote for
*  Trump in order to oust Genocide Joe, it's really a testament to how Biden has lost big
*  time within my community.
*  Kenyan President William Ruto is vowing to proceed with a plan to send 1,000 Kenyan police
*  officers to Haiti, despite a court ruling that the deployment would be unconstitutional.
*  The U.N. Security Council approved the mission last year as part of an effort to help combat
*  gang violence, which has grown under Haiti's unelected leader, the U.S.-backed Ariel Henry,
*  who has ruled since the 2021 assassination of Jovenel Moïse.
*  Meanwhile, the U.N. and aid groups are warning about a surge in sexual assaults and collective
*  rapes in Haiti as gangs fight to expand their power.
*  On Wednesday, protesters in Port-au-Prince burned barricades to protest Prime Minister
*  Ariel Henry's rule.
*  But people can't take it anymore, because Ariel Henry is building gangs to plunder and
*  destroy these people.
*  Well, today we say that the battle for the revolution is possible.
*  The final fight for justice is possible.
*  We must disrupt this Ariel with all his team to give this country another direction.
*  In Belgium, farmers from across Europe have converged in the capital of Brussels, calling
*  on European Union leaders to end free trade agreements that allow cheaper goods to dominate
*  the market and ease environmental regulations.
*  Hundreds of tractors have taken over Luxembourg Square near the European Parliament.
*  Farmers clash with police, who hose some of the protesters with water.
*  This is an Italian farmer.
*  First of all, we decided to come here to join with other kind of European young farmers
*  to create a unique voice, not against, but with the cooperation of the European Parliament
*  and the other kind of police, because we'd like to safeguard our tradition, our farmers'
*  moods, our quality of food, but to safeguard the majority part of this kind of situation,
*  the dignified incomes.
*  The farmer protests, which started in France but soon spread across the EU, have disrupted
*  traffic and led to confrontations with police in recent weeks and rising tensions ahead
*  of today's EU summit.
*  Some far-right nationalist leaders have seized on the movement to gain traction and foment
*  EU sentiment, including Francis Marine Le Pen and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban,
*  who met with farmers in Brussels earlier today.
*  A sweeping new government study finds contaminated water at the Camp Lejeune military base in
*  North Carolina led to elevated cancer rates among people who lived and worked at Lejeune
*  decades ago.
*  Previous studies linked the drinking water at the base to blood and organ cancers and
*  Parkinson's disease.
*  Victims of the contamination, which plagued Camp Lejeune from at least 1953 to 1987, have
*  for years been fighting for compensation and recognition from the U.S. government.
*  The new findings are likely to boost their legal claims, which they have until August
*  to file under a new federal law.
*  Over 160,000 claims have been filed so far.
*  On Capitol Hill, senators on the Judiciary Committee grilled the CEOs of Metta, TikTok,
*  X, Snapchat and Discord Wednesday, arguing social media companies must be held accountable
*  for the sexual exploitation of children that their apps facilitate and the harmful effects
*  of their products on the mental health of young people.
*  This is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham addressing Metta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
*  In
*  of the session's most sensational moments, Mark Zuckerberg stood up and awkwardly apologized
*  to the families who were present at the hearing after being pressured by Republican Senator
*  Josh Hawley.
*  Many families held up photos of their children who died or were harmed by social media.
*  Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel also directly apologized to families after prompting from California
*  Democrat Lafonza Butler.
*  Meanwhile, Republican Senator Tom Cotton hounded TikTok CEO Xu Zichu, who is Singaporean,
*  over his citizenship and ties to the Chinese government.
*  Senator Cotton and Republican colleagues have called for TikTok to be banned, claiming
*  it's a spy app for the Chinese Communist Party.
*  Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the House Wednesday passed a $78 billion bill that would expand
*  the child tax credit while reviving some corporate tax breaks.
*  While held as a bipartisan victory by centrist lawmakers, around two dozen Democrats voted
*  against it.
*  Progressive Congress member from Texas, Greg Kassar, was one of them, arguing, quote,
*  In exchange for a partial return of the child tax credit, Republicans got hundreds of billions
*  of dollars in corporate tax cuts.
*  For every dollar going to kids in this bill, $5 goes to corporations.
*  We have the money to pull every child in America out of poverty.
*  We just need to say no to accepting crumbs while corporations get a full steak dinner,
*  Kassar said.
*  A Delaware judge has voided the $56 billion compensation package of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
*  The judge noted the astronomical 2018 pay package was the largest ever in public corporate
*  history and that Tesla's board failed to prove the compensation plan was fair.
*  And in more related news, Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic lawmakers are pushing a union
*  back bill that would raise taxes on companies where CEOs make more than 50 times above the
*  salary of an average worker.
*  The measure could raise $150 billion in revenue over a decade.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
