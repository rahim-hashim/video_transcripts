# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” February 16, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SFQQApNoYU)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Russia's state media is reporting imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died
*  at the age of 47.
*  Prison authorities said in a statement earlier today Navalny felt ill after going on a walk
*  and lost consciousness.
*  They say medical staff was unable to resuscitate him.
*  The cause of death has not yet been determined.
*  Navalny's spokesperson, Kari Yamiche, said on social media their team has not received
*  confirmation of his death and that Navalny's lawyer was traveling to the penal colony located
*  in the town of Kharp in the Arctic Circle, where Navalny is serving a 19-year sentence
*  on charges of extremism over his criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
*  The prison, nicknamed Polar Wolf, is among the harshest in Russia, due in part to the
*  severe winter.
*  Navalny has been imprisoned since 2021 when he returned to Moscow after an assassination
*  attempt with the nerve agent Novoselchuk in 2020.
*  Navalny has been hailed as an anti-corruption crusader who is willing to stand up to Putin
*  and has also been condemned for his past ultranationalist comments.
*  In Gaza, Israel's attack on Yanukhan Younis' Nasser Hospital has killed at least five patients
*  after electricity and oxygen supplies were cut off.
*  This is a hospital volunteer describing the forced evacuation ahead of Israel's incursion.
*  Ninety-nine percent of the people in Nasser Hospital evacuated.
*  There are nearly 20 members of the medical staff still there.
*  There is tension still.
*  There is no protection or safety.
*  Quadcopters are everywhere.
*  Even ferocious dogs, which have monitoring cameras around their necks, are in the hospital
*  in an aggressive way.
*  This comes as fears mount over a planned Israeli ground attack on some 1.4 million
*  people in Raffa.
*  Even the U.S. has said the move would be a disaster without a realistic evacuation plan.
*  The U.N. and others say there's no plausible way to evacuate Raffa.
*  Moving to a safe place in Gaza is an illusion.
*  And we need to push back on the calls that we're all hearing from the authorities to
*  say, you must help us move the people of Gaza to some safe place.
*  This is an illusion.
*  Israeli airstrikes on Raffa continue to kill Palestinian civilians.
*  This is the mother of one of the victims speaking earlier today.
*  My daughter's husband is from the Zarbi family.
*  She died with all of her family.
*  I live in Mirage, and she lives in Raffa.
*  When I heard the news, I started screaming, asking my children to take me to see her.
*  But they told me, where should we take you at night?
*  Stay here.
*  I told them to take me to see her.
*  But they said that she was unrecognizable.
*  And I said that even if it was only her flesh, I wanted to see her.
*  Over 130 journalists have been killed in Gaza since October 7th, according to the local
*  media office.
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists says some three-quarters of all journalists killed
*  last year died in Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  Of the 99 journalists killed around the world in 2023, 72 were Palestinian.
*  Students at Stanford University are ending a months-long sit-in to demand the university
*  call for a ceasefire in Gaza and divest from Israeli companies complicit in war crimes,
*  among other things.
*  Stanford officials had started cracking down on the action, which began in October, threatening
*  to arrest and discipline students who camped out on campus.
*  The school finally agreed to two meetings with the group to discuss their demands, leading
*  to the decision to disband the longest continuous sit-in in Stanford's history.
*  New York Judge Juan Marchant ruled that Donald Trump's hush money case can proceed, setting
*  March 25th as a start date for the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president.
*  Trump's lawyers had sought to delay the trial, claiming it'll interfere with campaigning.
*  Trump will be required to attend the trial, which is expected to last six weeks.
*  Meanwhile, New York State Judge Arthur Angorin is expected to rule today on the $370 million
*  civil fraud case against Trump for inflating his business's net worth to obtain more
*  favorable loans.
*  This comes as Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis took the stand in Georgia.
*  Defense lawyers are seeking to remove Willis from the sweeping election subversion case
*  against Trump and his allies over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor
*  in the case.
*  Wade also took the stand Thursday, as both parties denied any wrongdoing or any financial
*  benefit from their personal relationship, which they say ended last year.
*  Fonny Willis sparred with Trump defense lawyers throughout the contentious hearing.
*  You've been intrusive into people's personal lives.
*  You're confused.
*  You think I'm on trial.
*  These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.
*  I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.
*  In other Trump news, the GOP frontrunner repeated his threat against NATO allies that he says
*  do not pay enough into the military alliance.
*  At a campaign rally in South Carolina Wednesday, Trump said, quote, if they're not going
*  to pay, we're not going to protect, OK?
*  Unquote.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is addressing the Munich Security Conference today, where
*  she's expected to reassure NATO allies following Trump's remarks.
*  Special counsel David Weiss has charged a former FBI informant with lying about President
*  Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden receiving millions of dollars from the Ukrainian air
*  energy company Burisma.
*  Alexander Smirnov was arrested Wednesday at a Las Vegas airport.
*  The Bidens alleged illegal involvement with Burisma is central to Republicans' impeachment
*  inquiry into the president.
*  In Russia, anti-war opposition politician Boris Nadezhdin acknowledged his chances of running
*  for the presidency against Vladimir Putin next month, quote, have plunged completely
*  unquote, after Russia's Supreme Court rejected legal challenges to his disqualification.
*  Nadezhdin's candidacy was thwarted last week when election authorities claimed there
*  were irregularities in some of the signatures collected for his application.
*  He said his campaign had nonetheless been successful in advancing an alternative to
*  Putin.
*  We have opened up a great breach.
*  We have shown that a huge number of people in the country do not support the course that
*  is being implemented now.
*  A huge number of people want Russia to be peaceful and free.
*  Senegal's constitutional council Thursday overturned President Macky Sall's decision
*  to delay this month's presidential election, ruling the move unconstitutional.
*  President Sall, who served the two terms allowed under Senegalese law, ordered the election
*  be postponed until December, triggering deadly protests, plunging Senegal into political
*  turmoil as his opponents accused him of orchestrating a constitutional coup.
*  Senegal's constitutional council urged authorities to reschedule the vote as soon as possible.
*  Greece has become the first Orthodox Christian country to legalize same-sex marriage.
*  It's the 16th EU country to legislate marriage equality, the measure which passed a parliamentary
*  vote Thursday despite opposition from the powerful Orthodox Church, also grants same-sex
*  couples equal parental rights, including the right to adopt.
*  Members of Greece's LGBTQ communities gather to celebrate the historic victory.
*  I'm very happy.
*  As someone who grew up in the countryside, this is a dream I've waited for for many
*  years, just like all of us.
*  Literally, I am at a loss for words.
*  I'm no longer a second-class citizen.
*  We have the same obligations, but now we also have more of the same rights.
*  Twelve survivors of sexual abuse and trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein are suing the FBI for failing
*  to protect them.
*  The 12 unnamed plaintiffs say the FBI ignored tips and complaints about Epstein and his
*  close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for over 20 years.
*  Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges.
*  Ghislaine Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2022 of
*  helping Epstein recruit and sexually assault teenage girls.
*  Climate groups have sued the Biden administration over its failure to adequately assess the
*  public health impacts on frontline communities and its five-year plan for offshore drilling
*  in the Gulf of Mexico.
*  Advocates say residents in the region already suffer disproportionate health burdens due
*  to the toxic pollution produced by federal offshore oil and gas leasing.
*  This comes as the American Petroleum Institute has also filed a lawsuit against the Biden
*  administration demanding officials greenlight more lease sales despite dire warnings of
*  the impacts on the climate and people's health.
*  Meanwhile, researchers estimate over 125 million U.S. residents will be exposed to unhealthy
*  by 2054 due to intensifying wildfires made worse by climate change.
*  In related news, scientists warn worsening wildfires, deforestation and warmer temperatures
*  could permanently destroy the water cycle sustaining large portions of the Amazon rainforest
*  in the coming decades.
*  In a study published this week by the journal Nature, researchers say that between 10 percent
*  to nearly half of the Amazon's ecosystem is at risk of transitioning from rainforest
*  to savanna.
*  By the year 2050 unless deforestation is dramatically reduced, an urgent action is taken to curb
*  the worst impacts of global warming.
*  This is one of the study's lead authors, Bernardo Flores, a researcher at the University
*  of Santa Catarina in Brazil.
*  Once we cross this tipping point, we cannot, maybe we cannot do anything anymore.
*  And then it's useless to stop deforestation.
*  To try to stop, we may not even be able to because the forest will die by itself.
*  So I mean, it's time to read alert.
*  And a new report from the Center for Climate Integrity reveals the oil and plastics industries
*  have deceptively promoted recycling as a sustainable solution for over half a century despite knowing
*  plastic recycling is not technically or economically viable at scale.
*  The report titled The Fraud of Plastic Recycling uncovers new documents showing companies like
*  and the plastics industry have pushed a misleading public campaign for decades, helping fuel
*  the plastic waste crisis in order to keep making money and avoid regulation.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  Thank you.
