*  My son is a martyr.
*  We are told to go to Rafah because it is safe.
*  I have 50 families staying over.
*  They bombed and destroyed us.
*  Where do we go?

*  The old and helpless people, what can they do?
*  Where do we go?
*  On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu.
*  Cameron told Sky News he pushed Netanyahu to accept a pause in the fighting.
*  It's time for an immediate pause in the fighting, because we've got to not only get the aid
*  in but, crucially, we've got to get those hostages out.
*  And what I think we can do now is plan for how you turn that pause into a permanent,
*  sustainable ceasefire without a return to fighting.

*  taking part in the assassination program.

*  Who gave you the targets?
*  We received the target intelligence from the UA government.
*  How did you receive them?
*  In intelligence packets.
*  Cards?
*  Cards.
*  How many cards did you receive?
*  Ten to start.
*  And one of them was Ansaf Maia?
*  Yes.
*  U.S. Africa Command said Tuesday U.S. strikes in Somalia killed three members of al-Shabaab

*  … tanker of staircases.
*  No matter what that was, it should be—
*  Oh, great!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  UAW!
*  Biden's UAW endorsement comes even though UAW has publicly called for a ceasefire while
*  Biden refuses to, leading some members to oppose the endorsement.

*  In Minnesota, prosecutors charged a state trooper with second-degree murder for the
*  fatal shooting of Ricky Cobb II, a black man, during a traffic stop in Minneapolis last

*  A federal judge has sentenced a January 6 insurrectionist and proud boys member to six

*  Over 1,200 people have so far been charged with crimes related to the Capitol insurrection.
*  In Alabama, prison officials are scheduled to execute Kenneth Smith today using nitrogen
*  gas asphyxiation for the first time ever.
*  On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Smith's plea to halt the execution.
*  His lawyers argued, attempting to execute him for a second time after he survived a
*  botched lethal injection in 2022 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

*  The case has gained international attention.
*  A high-profile Italian nonprofit linked to the Vatican spoke out against Smith's planned
*  execution this week.
*  This is Mario Marazitti, Italian journalist, politician and death penalty abolition advocate.
*  Kenneth Smith's execution risks to be a milestone execution, if it happens, because
*  it sets a new standard.
*  It lowers humanity at the level of a state that has a frenzy and a killing fury against
*  one individual.
*  So it is the litmus test for the level of civilization today if we are losing the battle
*  of a culture of life and a culture of death becomes just normal, as it is normal in times
*  of war.
*  In Texas, state authorities continue to bar federal border patrol agents from accessing
*  with Mexico, defying a Supreme Court order issued this week.
*  Texas troopers are still erecting razor wire along the border, which has cut off most of
*  Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, a city park on the banks of the Rio Grande.
*  On Wednesday, a Texas official says a 35-year-old man from Nicaragua drowned in the Rio Grande.
*  Two others were rescued.
*  Last week, a mother and her two young children died in the area while attempting to cross
*  the river.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Donald Trump's reportedly pressuring Republican senators
*  to reject a bipartisan border bill because his concerned passage of the legislation could
*  help Joe Biden's re-election chances in November.
*  In Argentina, labor unions led tens of thousands of protesters in a general strike against
*  President Javier Mele's so-called shock therapy economic policies.
*  Since taking office last month, Mele has ordered massive spending cuts, shut down half the
*  government's ministries, devalued the peso by more than 50 percent against the dollar,
*  ordered the deregulation of business and the privatization of state-run industries and
*  cracked down on the right to protest.
*  This is Guillermo Picagini of the Workers Socialist Movement Party.
*  What are we demanding for the fall of the decree of necessity, an urgency that seeks
*  to give public power to President Mele?
*  What do we want for the omnibus bills to fall?
*  It doesn't only take away our social rights, it also transforms the right to protest into
*  a crime.
