**Democracy Now!:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPNQBHFfMh8)
*  AMY GOODMAN, The War and Peace Report.
*  Following Tuesday's primaries, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump
*  appear set for a rematch in November, after both candidates secured enough delegates to
*  win their party's nomination.
*  It'll be the first presidential rematch in the United States since 1956.
*  Biden and Trump both won races Tuesday in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state,
*  where over 7 percent of Democratic voters chose uncommitted as part of an ongoing protest
*  over Biden's support for Israel's assault on Gaza.
*  The European Union's foreign policy chief has accused Israel of using starvation as
*  a weapon of war by blocking aid from entering Gaza.
*  Joseph Burrell spoke Tuesday.
*  JOSEPH BOREL, European Union Foreign Policy Chief.
*  But this is a humanitarian crisis which is not a natural disaster.
*  It's not a flood.
*  It's not a earthquake.
*  It's a man-made.
*  And when we look for alternative ways of providing support by sea or by air, we have to remind
*  that we have to do it because the natural way of providing support through roads is
*  being closed, artificially closed.
*  And starvation is being used as a war arm.
*  And when we condemn this happening in Ukraine, we have to use the same words for what's
*  happening in Gaza.
*  On Tuesday, the World Food Program managed to deliver aid to Gaza City for the first
*  time in nearly a month.
*  The agency said famine is imminent in northern Gaza, unless aid deliveries increase exponentially.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, a group of senators, led by Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley and Chris
*  Van Hollen, are calling on Biden to cut off military aid to Israel if it continues to
*  block U.S. humanitarian aid from entering Gaza.
*  The senators cited the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which bars military aid to countries
*  that restrict the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance.
*  Earlier today, at least four Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on an
*  UNRWA aid distribution office in Rafah.
*  Health officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks killed another 88 people over the last 24
*  hours, bringing the death toll since October 7th to over 31,200, including more than 12,300
*  children.
*  The UN relief agency, UNRWA, says more children were killed in the first four months of Israel's
*  assault on Gaza than in all other wars over the past four years combined.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have killed at least four Palestinians, including
*  a 13-year-old boy, as it carried out raids on Jenin, Tulkaram, Ramallah and other cities.
*  According to health officials, at least 427 Palestinians have been killed in the West
*  Bank by Israeli forces and settlers since October 7th.
*  Israel's expanding attacks deep inside Lebanon.
*  Earlier today, an Israeli drone attacked a car in the city of Tire, killing at least
*  one person.
*  On Tuesday, a pair of Israeli airstrikes killed two and wounded nine in northeastern Lebanon.
*  Israel also struck areas near the Lebanese city of Baabak on Monday.
*  Hezbollah responded by launching 100 rockets at northern Israel on Tuesday in what's
*  been described as the heaviest barrage since the war in Gaza began.
*  We'll have more on Lebanon and Gaza after headlines with Rami Khouri.
*  Kenya has announced its halting plans to send a thousand police officers to Haiti until
*  a new government is in place.
*  The announcement came hours after Haiti's unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry agreed
*  to resign following an armed uprising against his rule.
*  Caribbean leaders, the U.S. and Canada, have proposed setting up a seven-member presidential
*  panel that would appoint a new interim prime minister.
*  U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller spoke Tuesday.
*  – Under the terms of the agreement that was announced yesterday, we expect that the
*  members of the Transitional Council will be appointed in the next 24 to 48 hours,
*  and then they will take the step to appoint an interim prime minister in the near future
*  after that.
*  – Ukrainian drones have attacked three Russian oil refineries as part of a major attack on
*  critical Russian infrastructure.
*  Russian forces said 58 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight.
*  This comes as the Biden administration's announced it will send a new $300 million
*  weapons package to Ukraine.
*  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a new interview Russia is ready
*  to use nuclear weapons if its sovereignty is threatened.
*  – From the technical point of view, of course we are ready.
*  The missiles are constantly combat ready.
*  This is firstly.
*  Secondly, and this is accepted by everybody, our nuclear triad is more modern than any
*  other triad.
*  Actually, only us and the Americans have a triad, and we have advanced much more than
*  them.
*  Our triad and the whole nuclear element is more modern.
*  – Police in Lithuania are investigating an attack on the former chief of staff of Alexei
*  Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader.
*  On Tuesday, Leonid Volkov was assaulted with a hammer and had tear gas sprayed in his eyes
*  outside his home in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.
*  The attack comes just weeks after Navalny died in a Russian Arctic prison.
*  Leonid Volkov spoke to Reuters just hours before the attack Tuesday and directly accused
*  Putin of ordering Navalny's killing.
*  – But in the moment, this dying dinosaur is very strong and can cause enormous damage.
*  That's what we've seen in the last two years in Ukraine and that's what we've seen
*  in the situation of the murder of Alexei Navalny.
*  And we have absolutely no doubt, like it's beyond reasonable doubt, that it was Putin's
*  personal order to kill him on February 16th.
*  – The attack on Volkov occurred ahead of this weekend's election in Russia.
*  Volkov and Navalny's wife Yulia have called on Russians to join an election day protest
*  at polling places at noon on Sunday.
*  Special counsel Robert Herr testified before Congress Tuesday about his report on President
*  Biden's mishandling of classified documents.
*  Republican lawmakers criticized Herr for not filing charges against the president, while
*  Democrats accused him of unfairly maligning the president.
*  In his report last month, Herr described Biden as a, quote, well-meaning elderly man with
*  a poor memory.
*  Democrats say a newly released transcript of Herr's interview with Biden shows the
*  president's memory was far stronger than Herr indicated.
*  At one point during the interview, Herr described Biden's memory as photographic.
*  Democratic Congressmember Adam Schiff criticized Herr about his report.
*  – What you did write was deeply prejudicial to the interests of the president.
*  You say it wasn't political and yet you must have understood.
*  You must have understood the impact of your words.
*  – Congressman, what you are suggesting is that I shape, sanitize, omit portions of my
*  reasoning and explanation to the attorney general for political reasons.
*  – No, I suggest that you not shape your report for political reasons, which is what you did.
*  – Time is the witness.
*  – That did not happen, Congressman.
*  That did not happen.
*  In news from Capitol Hill, the House is expected to vote today on a bill that could lead to
*  a nationwide ban on the popular social media app TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese
*  company ByteDance.
*  The bill attempts to force ByteDance to sell TikTok or be banned.
*  Backers of the bill claim TikTok poses a national security threat.
*  On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers spoke out against the legislation.
*  This is Congressmember Maxwell Alejandro Frost.
*  – I am highly concerned about our data being collective and being misused by both
*  foreign adversaries and also domestic companies.
*  But this bill does not fix that problem.
*  Let's be honest here.
*  This bill doesn't fix it.
*  In other congressional news, Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado has
*  announced he's leaving Congress at the end of next week, in a move that will further
*  erode the Republican's slim majority in the House.
*  Florida school teachers will be allowed to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity
*  under the condition the topics are not a part of formal classroom instruction.
*  The clarification came as part of a lawsuit settlement reached by Florida's education
*  and a group of LGBTQ plus rights advocates and families.
*  Opponents of Florida's Don't Say Gay law had argued the measure's vague language
*  sparked fear and confusion among educators and students who were unsure if even sharing
*  personal details about their lives, such as drawing a picture of their same-sex parents
*  for a school project, would be a violation of law.
*  And the New York Civil Liberties Union and Palestine Legal have filed a lawsuit against
*  Columbia University for suspending two pro-Palestine student groups, Students for
*  Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace.
*  The groups were suspended last November after organizing peaceful protests against
*  Israel's occupation and war on Gaza.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
