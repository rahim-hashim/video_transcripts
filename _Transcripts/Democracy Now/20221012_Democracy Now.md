# Health Insurance Whistleblower: Medicare Advantage Is "Heist" by Private Firms to Defraud the Public
**Democracy Now!:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgNxlrfygI)
*  This is Democracy Now!
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  A major investigation by The New York Times this weekend has found many of the nation's
*  largest health insurance companies have made billions of dollars in profits by exploiting
*  the government's Medicare Advantage program.
*  Eight of the 10 largest Medicare Advantage providers have overbilled the government.
*  Six of the 10 have been accused of fraud by the government or company whistleblowers.
*  This comes as the number of people enrolled in the privatized system continue to grow.
*  Projections show that by next year, more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries will be
*  enrolled in a private plan.
*  Under the system, health insurers get more government funding for sicker patients, which
*  has given the companies an incentive to make patients appear more ill than they actually
*  are.
*  UnitedHealth, Humana, Kaiser and other health insurance companies have been sued for fraud
*  for overdiagnosing patients to bump up profits.
*  The cost to taxpayers is staggering.
*  Overbilling by health insurance costs the government an estimated $12 to $25 billion
*  in 2020.
*  The New York Times reports doctors at Kaiser were offered bottles of champagne and bonuses
*  if they added additional illnesses to the medical records of their patients so the company
*  could make more money.
*  Joining us now is Wendell Potter, former executive for the health insurance company Cigna and
*  Humana.
*  Potter is now the president of the Center for Health and Democracy and the president
*  of business leaders for healthcare transformation.
*  He's author of the book Deadly Spin.
*  An insurance company insider speaks out on how corporate PR is killing healthcare and
*  deceiving Americans.
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Wendell, joining us from Philadelphia.
*  If you can start off by explaining how Medicare Advantage works, many people might say, oh,
*  they thought that was a government program for people 65 and older.
*  It's important to note that it is neither Medicare nor is it an advantage.
*  It is, I think, will be recognized in years to come as probably the biggest heist, the
*  biggest fraud, the biggest transfer of wealth from taxpayers, middle income, low income
*  Americans, from them to corporate executives and shareholders.
*  It is a plan that has been in the works or has been around for about 20 years.
*  It was born during the George W. Bush administration, when Republicans controlled Congress and they
*  were determined to start privatizing the Medicare program.
*  And as you noted, now, 20 years later, it's to the point that almost half, and in some
*  cities and districts, well more than half, already are enrolled in this program.
*  It is a private program.
*  It is operated by private insurance companies.
*  Most of them are for profit.
*  In fact, this year, over 80 percent of the enrollment in these plans were people enrolling
*  in for-profit plans.
*  They're lured into these plans with deceptive advertising.
*  The plans feature things that are common in private plans, but not in traditional Medicare,
*  such as prior authorization.
*  Doctors have to get permission in many cases from the insurance company before they can
*  treat their patients.
*  Inadequate networks, particularly as people get older and sicker, and very, very high
*  out-of-pocket cost if people, knowingly or inadvertently, go out of network.
*  So it is a program that absolutely should be called disadvantage.
*  And, Wendell Potter, it's—to me, it's amazing.
*  The healthcare system in this country right now, when you go to a general practitioner,
*  they basically are constantly referring you to specialists who always then want to do
*  more tests, and it's the testing process of all of these specialists that drive up
*  these costs.
*  And as you say, on television, almost every single night, there are ads trying to lure
*  senior citizens into these Medicare Advantage programs.
*  This privatization of Medicare.
*  Why isn't the government exercising more regulation or control over this process, especially
*  the one that, as The Times reported, are piling on imagined or badly documented illnesses?
*  Well, it's not because Congress has never seen this kind of information before.
*  Many governmental organizations, like the OIG, the GAO, MedPAC, which advises Congress
*  on Medicare issues and payment issues, and the Department of Justice, which has intervened
*  in a number of these whistleblower lawsuits against these companies, that's been something
*  that's been going on for a long time.
*  And there also, by the way, have been other important journalists who have taken this
*  on and done this investigation, like Fred Schulte at Kaiser Health News, Trudy Lieberman
*  at the Center for Health Journalism.
*  So they've known this, but they've turned a blind eye in many cases because of the massive
*  amounts of our money that these big corporations are spending to lobby Congress, to throw money
*  into their campaigns for reelection and to propaganda campaigns and very, very misleading
*  advertising, as you just mentioned.
*  Open enrollment will begin in just a few weeks for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, and you
*  will see just a barrage, a constant barrage of ads from these companies that are—they
*  do not tell the truth, they leave out important details, like some that I mentioned earlier.
*  So that's how they pull it off.
*  In regulatory capture, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been really asleep
*  at the will.
*  They—Congress actually has given CMS more authority to crack down on this fraudulent
*  program, but they've just turned a blind eye.
*  That is a classic example of regulatory capture.
*  What is regulatory capture, Wendell?
*  What that means is that the companies, the corporations that—administrative offices
*  like CMS, the Center for Medicare Services, and Health and Human Services, they have such
*  influence over these agencies that they don't act on behalf of Americans.
*  They act on behalf of corporations to protect their profits.
*  One of the administrators of CMS some years ago went straight from that job into the
*  insurance industry as head of America's health insurance plans, which is called AHIP.
*  They also have staffed—former members of Congress have staffed front groups for the
*  industry.
*  There's one called the Better Medicare Alliance, a former Pennsylvania congresswoman, a Democrat,
*  was the first to head that up.
*  So, that's how it happens.
*  There's this revolving door between private industry and government and massive—again,
*  massive amounts of money that fund all this lobbying and propaganda.
*  And, Wendell Potter, you had your own mother disenrolled from the Medicare Advantage Plan
*  over a decade ago.
*  Why did that happen?
*  And what was the impact on her health as a result?
*  This is something that every senior should know.
*  These companies go after people when they're younger and healthier with kind of a siren
*  call that you can enroll in these plans for no money.
*  You can actually get money put back into your Social Security account, as we hear from people
*  like Joe Namath and William Shatner and Jimmy J.J. Walker.
*  But the truth is, as you get older and sicker, then you become aware of just the disadvantages
*  of this program.
*  My mother broke her hip.
*  She needed to have rehab and skilled nursing services for a while.
*  When we looked at what was available to her in the provider network, it was incredibly
*  inadequate.
*  So, I worked with my mom to get her out of the Medicare Advantage Plan.
*  It was one that was operated by UnitedHealthcare and they mark it in conjunction with AARP,
*  which is an outrage, in my view.
*  But she—but there's a problem there, because when you do that and you're older and you
*  wait, you know, years after becoming eligible for Medicare, it's harder and more expensive
*  to get a Medicare supplement policy to help cover your out-of-pockets.
*  So we did that knowing that.
*  We had to pay a lot of money.
*  But at least she was able to get the care that she needed at a quality facility where
*  she got the rehab and skilled nursing care that she needed, which she would not have
*  gotten had she stayed in that Medicare Advantage program.
*  I'm confident my mom lived additional years because of what we were able to do.
*  Wendell Potter, finally, what should Congress do to prevent this kind of fraud?
*  And we're moving into the midterm elections.
*  There is almost no discussion of Medicare for all in the corporate media.
*  I don't know if it's because every five or six minutes they break for a commercial
*  for some drug company, for some new illness that has been defined.
*  But what has to happen right now?
*  Well, there are some important bills that have been introduced, and some I trust will
*  be introduced before too long.
*  Congresswoman Katie Porter from California has introduced an important bill that would
*  force the government and force these plans to be more forthcoming, more transparent,
*  to provide information and data that they're just withholding from the government.
*  It should not even be called Medicare Advantage.
*  Like I said earlier, it's not Medicare, nor is it Advantage.
*  So I think there should be legislation that should bar these companies even using the
*  name Medicare.
*  There are some good members of Congress who understand this, Congressman Porter, Congressman
*  Pucan, Pramila Jayapal, Jan Schakowsky.
*  They're all aware of this, and they unfortunately are in the minority, even among Democrats.
*  But I think that New York Times story and some of the other things that advocates are
*  beginning to do will wake them up and force them to get on the stick and do something.
*  Congresswoman Jayapal has been the lead sponsor, as you may know, of Medicare for all bill.
*  She gets it.
*  Others get it too.
*  But this is going to be an important step along the way.
*  There's going to be a big, frankly, effort by industry to say we should have Medicare
*  Advantage for all, which would be the greatest travesty, I think, that this country could
*  ever experience.
*  AMY GOODMAN, The New York Times, The New York Times, and The New York Times.
*  Wendell Potter, I want to thank you for being with us.
*  We'll link to that New York Times exposé.
*  Wendell Potter is former executive for health insurance companies Cigna and Humana, now serving
*  as president of the Center for Health and Democracy and the president of business leaders
*  for healthcare transformation.
