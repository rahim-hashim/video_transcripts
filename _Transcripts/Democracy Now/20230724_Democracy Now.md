# Greg Mitchell on "Oppenheimer" & Why Hollywood Is Still Afraid of the Truth About the Atomic Bomb
**Democracy Now!:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKEtLdfPQLk)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  We end today's show at the movies.
*  Amidst the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet for the
*  U.S. premiere of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.
*  Meanwhile, people filled theaters this weekend to see the film about J. Robert Oppenheimer,
*  all known as the father of the atomic bomb.
*  The physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer developed and tested the world's first atomic bomb
*  in New Mexico.
*  In that state, the film is being preceded by a 15-second advertisement produced by the
*  Union of Concerned Scientists that notes, quote, Oppenheimer's bomb led to decades
*  of nuclear testing across the Southwest.
*  Communities still suffer health impacts related to the tests, many without government recognition
*  or justice.
*  For more, we're joined by Greg Mitchell, documentary filmmaker, author of numerous
*  books about this very topic, including The Beginning or the End, How Hollywood and America
*  Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
*  He was editor of Nuclear Times Magazine in the 1980s.
*  He's written about this new film for Mother Jones on his substack and an opinion piece
*  for the L.A. Times headlined Oppenheimer is Here.
*  Is Hollywood Still Afraid of the Truth About the Atomic Bomb?
*  Greg, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  Summer calling this the greatest anti-nuclear film ever.
*  You have a different and a critical perspective on the film.
*  Why don't you just talk about your response to the film, what it got right, what it got
*  wrong?
*  Right, yes.
*  I saw an early screening of the film before the critical opinions came in, so I saw it
*  with a very open mind.
*  And I think people should see the film.
*  I think it's very well written, well acted, well directed, and I think it probably has
*  good intentions.
*  So I would certainly encourage people to see it.
*  However, I did find a number of issues with it, which I've written about really every
*  day on my blog newsletter.
*  And it's not so much what's shown in the movie.
*  The movie does end up and wants to warn people about future dangers and future threats of
*  the bomb, which is admirable.
*  And I'm not sure any director besides Christopher Nolan with a long track record of popularity
*  would have or could have had this film made.
*  However, the omissions are quite serious.
*  You already mentioned one, which is really the lack, almost the total lack of any mentions
*  or exploration of the radiation, revolutionary new radiation effects of this weapon, both
*  in the Trinity test, which is one of the main focuses of the film, showing the Trinity test.
*  It does not show the radioactive cloud that drifted away and the fallout that affected
*  people.
*  And then of course, as you mentioned, the decades of nuclear tests, exposure to soldiers
*  and workers and so forth.
*  So that's one thing.
*  Another thing is that it does not show any images of people on the ground in Hiroshima
*  and Nagasaki.
*  There's nothing we see Oppenheimer watching a screen where it sounds like the footage
*  is being aired or screened.
*  We do not see any of those images.
*  We just see him growing a little bit disturbed about it.
*  They do not, in the same time, they do not mention that 85% of the victims in Hiroshima
*  and Nagasaki were civilians.
*  They don't mention that at all.
*  And another thing, they barely mention Nagasaki.
*  It's kind of thrown in in passing in the last part of the film.
*  It's just kind of tossed in as if it was kind of forced into the script.
*  And for my mind, one of the most important things is certainly it does not challenge
*  in any way the Hiroshima narrative or official narrative, as I call it, that has held sway
*  since 1945 about the decision to use the bomb.
*  We can talk about that more.
*  It's very important and the legacy for today.
*  Instead, I think when people say it's an anti-nuclear film, you know, there is the message of dangers
*  for today and control of the weapons and so forth.
*  But it does not challenge the use of the bomb in 1945.
*  I think you're supposed to take away from the haunted visage of Oppenheimer and the
*  great actor, Killian Murphy, his sort of vague, conflicted, confusing regrets that he seemed to
*  issue during the movie and during his life.
*  But in fact, you know, as I've shown at my blog and in my books, Oppenheimer, in fact,
*  defended the use of the bomb against Japan to the end of his life, right up to 1965, 1966.
*  So the film is a little misleading in that.
*  But in fact, it's true and it's quite accurate that Oppenheimer really did not reject it.
*  And the film certainly does not challenge the decision to use the bomb.
*  It's more moving forward from 1945.
*  So when you talk about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in fact, the footage that came out, that these
*  scientists were shown at Los Alamos afterwards, the horror of the skin melted, there's one
*  reference to it, you know, an image of it.
*  An image, yeah.
*  But the actual film was classified for years.
*  Is that right, Greg?
*  Yeah, well, yeah, I've written a whole book called Atomic Cover-Up about it.
*  Then I directed a film two years ago that got quite a bit of attention, including on the show
*  called Atomic Cover-Up, which looked at the poster, you know, the poster Hiroshima and
*  Nagasaki complete suppression of both Japanese footage and the U.S. color footage that was
*  seized and suppressed for many decades.
*  So of course, we don't see that in the film.
*  I wouldn't necessarily expect that.
*  But, you know, the decision to use the bomb in the film is handled.
*  I mean, there is an accurate scene which shows at the end of May of 1945,
*  the interim committee, which was Truman's leading advisory committee on this, had a meeting
*  where the subject sort of briefly came up how to use the bomb and should they use it.
*  Oppenheimer, as he did in real life, shot this down and said this was, you know,
*  couldn't work or wouldn't work.
*  It was the wrong idea to do a demonstration shot.
*  You know, the bomb had to be used.
*  And then one of the other members of the committee then gives a ringing
*  explanation, which became the Hiroshima narrative that still carries the day today,
*  you might say, with the media and some historians, which is that, you know,
*  only the use of the bomb, only the use of two bombs really would prevent a bloody invasion of Japan,
*  hundreds of thousands of U.S. casualties and so forth.
*  And this is not really challenged in the film.
*  And not by Oppenheimer, not really in the film narrative.
*  It then goes to the future.
*  And Hiroshima and Nagasaki are kind of left alone.
*  And, you know, the danger of this and the legacy and the reason I've written so much on this for
*  the past 40 years really is that the lessons for today is that, yes, everyone says we should never
*  use nuclear weapons again.
*  We, it's terrible.
*  They must not be used.
*  But on the other hand, we make these two exceptions from 1945 of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
*  For people to understand, Greg, I mean, these scientists that came together at Los Alamos,
*  the secret community that was built for them to build the atomic bomb, were motivated by
*  taking on Nazi Germany.
*  But then Nazi Germany surrenders, right?
*  Or is beaten, is defeated.
*  So if you can explain further, because this is something you're so steeped in,
*  what it meant then to decide to use this bomb on Japan and also where the Soviet Union came into
*  this, where Russia came into this.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, of course, the motivation for making the bomb was largely Hitler and Nazi Germany.
*  Of course, many of the top physicists were refugee Jewish scientists, physicists from
*  Germany.
*  And it's really the main reason we beat Hitler to the bomb.
*  Germany surrendered and we were still fighting Japan, of course, very, very bloody battles and
*  bombing their cities that spring into the summer.
*  So, of course, then the target became Japan and the focus.
*  And there were scientists such as Leo Szilard, who did circulate a petition that asked people to
*  ask other scientists to sign this petition that would go to Truman that would ask them to not
*  use the bomb or at least delay using the bomb.
*  Oppenheimer was one of those people who squelched that petition, incidentally.
*  But basically the decision was made that we, even though an invasion of Japan was
*  not scheduled till November and December, that we had to use this bomb or we wanted to use this
*  bomb as soon as possible.
*  And so we had the Trinity test and then we had the dropping of the bomb in early August.
*  You mentioned the Soviet aspect of it.
*  And it's very important because we, at our urging, insistence, Stalin agreed to enter the war
*  in by mid-August.
*  And yet we went ahead and dropped the bomb before the Soviets entered the war.
*  Some people say that the Soviet entry, along with a couple other negotiating things,
*  could have ended the war pretty much in the same time frame, prime that it ended.
*  Truman himself, as I'm sure you're aware, wrote in his diary,
*  Finney Japs, when the Soviets would enter the war.
*  General Eisenhower later said it was totally unnecessary to use the bomb, that Japan was
*  going to surrender very soon.
*  And you have to step back a bit, which the film doesn't do the best job of, of showing,
*  okay, you deliberately targeted and exploded these bombs over the center of two cities.
*  That was the aim.
*  Oppenheimer was in on that.
*  Everyone knew in the targeting committee that the aim was to really to kill as many people
*  and cause as much destruction as possible, which they executed.
*  It wasn't, this was not a surprise.
*  So you really have to go back and say, was it worth, especially to the people, of course,
*  who died and the lessons for today, where we still have a first strike policy today,
*  that we can use nuclear weapons in response to a crisis or conventional attack.
*  And the lesson that we have from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which is still
*  endorsed by the media every year and many historians, is you can make exceptions and
*  decide to use these weapons because we not only use them against two cities,
*  but we continue, or many people continue to defend that today.
*  Finally, we're going to do a post show, part two of this conversation,
*  but I wanted to read a tweet to give people a sense of what we're going to talk about.
*  From the author and journalist Alyssa Lynn Valdez, who wrote this quote from the New York Times
*  Review of Oppenheimer Film, he served as director of a clandestine weapons lab built in a near
*  desolate stretch of Los Alamos in New Mexico. She notes, it was inhabited by Hispanos. They were
*  given less than 24 hours to leave their farms bulldozed. We have 15 seconds to give us a sense
*  of what we'll talk about in part two. Well, there was, there were a lot of secrecy
*  aspects to Los Alamos that, I mean, that's a lot to go into there, but the legacy of Los Alamos was
*  a lot of these radiation effects and secrecy, the secrecy regime that really held sway in the U.S.
*  for decades after, really right to this day. Well, Greg Mitchell, we want to thank you
*  for being with us. We're going to link to your new piece for the Los Angeles Times.
*  Oppenheimer's here, is Hollywood still afraid of the truth about the atomic bomb? And we'll do
*  part two at democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.
