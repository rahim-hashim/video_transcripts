# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 19, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it6nrgjYMNo)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Famine is imminent in northern Gaza, according to a U.N.-backed report published Monday.
*  Michael Fakhry, the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food, said the U.S. is, quote,
*  complicit in the starvation of the Palestinian people in Gaza and urged the Biden administration
*  to call for a ceasefire and stop sending weapons and money to Israel.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and UNRWA chief Felipe Lazzarini also blasted
*  what they called the man-made hunger crisis Monday.
*  This is EU's top diplomat, Joseph Borrell.
*  This, for me, is not a natural disaster.
*  It's not a flood.
*  It's not a earthquake.
*  It's entirely man-made.
*  I'm coming from Washington, and I dare to say, well, yes, Israel is provoking famine.
*  Borrell added, quote, before the war, Gaza was the greatest open-air prison.
*  Today, it's the greatest open-air graveyard, he said.
*  The European Union Monday approved sanctions against violent Israeli settlers in the occupied
*  West Bank and against Hamas.
*  The White House says President Biden told Benjamin Netanyahu Israel should not invade
*  Raffa during a Monday phone call, as the Israeli prime minister reportedly agreed to send a team
*  of Israeli officials to Washington to discuss an alternative approach.
*  But the Palestinian Foreign Ministry says Israel has already begun its large-scale attack
*  on Raffa without announcing it, as Israeli forces escalate their bombardment of the once
*  so-called safe zone, where some one and a half million Palestinians have taken shelter.
*  Earlier today, Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in Raffa and injured dozens of others.
*  We're in Ramadan.
*  People have sahur to prepare for the fast.
*  But we're having sahur over body remains, blood and martyrs.
*  There's U.S. support, European support and support of the whole world to Israel.
*  They support them with weapons and planes, with continuing planes.
*  They mock us and send four or five airdrops just to save face.
*  Close to 32,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since October 7th,
*  according to the latest official numbers.
*  74,000 others have been injured.
*  The police general tasked with coordinating the entry of aid trucks into northern Gaza
*  was killed by Israeli forces during their raid on the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City,
*  on Monday.
*  Faik Mabhou recently helped secure the arrival of food aid for two nights in a row,
*  after weeks of Israeli blockade.
*  Meanwhile, Al Jazeera journalist Ismail Argul, who was arrested and beaten during the Al-Shifa raid,
*  was released after 12 hours of detention.
*  While in Israeli custody, Argul said he and other journalists were forced to strip naked,
*  lie on their stomachs for hours in the cold while blindfolded with their hands tied.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces arrested journalist Rula Hassanein
*  and raided her home overnight.
*  She has a nine-month-old baby she was forced to leave behind despite still breastfeeding.
*  In related news, a 26-year-old Palestinian Bedouin detained in an Israeli prison died
*  over the weekend amidst reports of rampant abuse and medical neglect in Israeli jails.
*  Juma Abu-Khanima is at least the 13th person to die from mistreatment in an Israeli prison
*  since October 7th.
*  In Haiti, at least a dozen people were killed as armed groups attacked two upscale neighborhoods
*  in the capital Port-au-Prince, Monday.
*  The communities of La Boulle and Thomasin had remained relatively untouched by worsening
*  violence and turmoil in Haiti.
*  Residents described the chaotic scene early Monday.
*  Last night around 11 p.m., as we were sitting here, two young boys suddenly appeared
*  and opened fire on several of our brothers.
*  They didn't address anyone.
*  They just came up and started shooting.
*  They didn't ask any questions.
*  I was there when the shooting happened and I saw them get out of a car and start shooting.
*  I was trying to understand the situation.
*  Last week, unelected Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced he'll resign after
*  a coalition of armed groups opposing his rule declared an uprising.
*  Meanwhile, Haitian stakeholders and leaders of the Caribbean community or CARICOM are
*  still in negotiations to establish a transitional presidential council in Haiti.
*  In Nigeria, armed groups kidnapped at least 100 people, including children, in two separate
*  attacks in Kaduna State in the north.
*  The mass abduction is the latest attack following the separate kidnapping of nearly 300 students
*  and staff from a school in the northwestern town of Kuriga earlier this month.
*  Abductions in Nigeria have become more frequent in recent years as armed groups target residents
*  for large ransoms.
*  In Gambia, the National Assembly voted to repeal a landmark 2015 ban on female genital cutting,
*  also known as female genital mutilation.
*  If approved, it would be the first reversal of protections against the practice, which
*  causes long-term health effects, including increased risks of complications during pregnancy
*  and childbirth.
*  Less than 10 percent of the National Assembly's members are women.
*  This is Amnesty International researcher Michelle Erken.
*  It would simply be disastrous for women's rights, not only in Gambia but in the region.
*  It would tell young girls, you know, your rights can be easily taken away.
*  If this is passed, then what's next?
*  We have to really be strong about it and make sure that we don't take away something that
*  took so long to fight for.
*  Schools in South Sudan have temporarily shuttered in preparation for a scorching heat wave that's
*  expected to last for the next two weeks.
*  Officials have advised children to stay indoors as temperatures are likely to reach 113 degrees
*  Fahrenheit.
*  Extreme heat waves have become more common in South Sudan due to the worsening climate
*  crisis and has compounded an already dire humanitarian crisis due to conflict in the
*  region.
*  UN Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed concerns at reports the Burmese
*  military is continuing to bomb civilian areas, dozens of people reportedly killed, including
*  children, early Monday and Burmese military airstrikes, on a predominantly Rohingya village
*  in Rakhine State.
*  Clashes in the region of Surd after the end of a ceasefire in November between the Arakan
*  Army and Burmese forces that have been in place since 2021 military coup.
*  Guterres said, quote, the expansion of conflict is driving displacement and exacerbating
*  pre-existing vulnerabilities and discrimination.
*  In Syria, some 30,000 children and women who had ties to Islamic State militants are still
*  being detained in camps and prisons across North Syria under severely abusive conditions.
*  That's according to a UN-backed commission, which says most of the children were brought
*  to the camps a decade ago when the Islamic State controlled portions of land in the region.
*  It's been five years since the militant group lost its presence in Syria, but the children
*  have yet to be repatriated to their home countries, remaining in indefinite captivity.
*  Tens of thousands of people, many of them children under the age of 12 and women who
*  were married to Islamic State militants, are being held at a whole camp, which has been
*  described by the UN as a, quote, blight on the conscience of humanity.
*  Dozens of babies are reportedly born each month at a whole, which is located in a region
*  of northwestern Syria, still patrolled by hundreds of U.S. troops.
*  Meanwhile, teenage boys are kept in jails that are run by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led
*  Syrian Democratic forces.
*  In Argentina, protesters in Buenos Aires were met with riot police and tear gas Monday as
*  they marched in a union-led rally to protest mounting food insecurity, and far-right president
*  Javier Milet's massive cuts to social spending.
*  This is union leader Hugo Godoy.
*  Today we came back to march together to demand the government once again respond to this
*  worsening situation of the food crisis that over six million Argentinians suffer from.
*  The government doesn't even have an inch of humanity to guarantee food provisions to
*  soup kitchens.
*  It's as if they enjoyed the people's pain.
*  The protest took place days after Argentine senators dealt a major blow to President Javier
*  Milet's so-called economic shock therapy agenda, voting to block his sweeping decree.
*  Since taking office, Milet has imposed over 300 austerity and deregulation measures.
*  He also cracked down on the right to protest.
*  Argentina has the highest inflation rate in the world, even as it slowed down to 13 percent
*  last month, down from 20 percent in January.
*  UNICEF's warned children are suffering some of the worst effects of the current economic
*  crisis and Milet's cost-cutting measures, with a child poverty rate that could soon hit 70 percent.
*  Back in the United States, Donald Trump's failed to secure the $454 million bond for
*  his New York civil fraud case, increasing the likelihood New York Attorney General
*  Letitia James will seize his real estate assets.
*  Trump's lawyers said their client was turned down by around 30 bond underwriting companies.
*  The lawyers are requesting the former president be allowed to delay posting bond while he
*  appeals the case.
*  If their request is denied, Letitia James could start seizing Trump's properties on Monday.
*  In other Trump news, former White House aide Peter Navarro is expected to turn himself
*  into a federal prison in Miami today to serve his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.
*  Navarro will become the first-ever ex-White House official to serve time for a contempt
*  of Congress conviction after he refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Select
*  Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol insurrection.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court Monday heard arguments in two First Amendment cases, the National
*  Rifle Association's accusing a New York state official of threatening insurance companies
*  in order to get them to cut ties with the NRA.
*  In another case, conservative states and social media users allege the federal government
*  overstepped when it put pressure on social media companies to moderate misinformation
*  around COVID-19 and the 2020 election.
*  The justices appeared skeptical of efforts to limit the Biden administration's contact
*  with social media companies.
*  This is Justice Katanji Brown Jackson.
*  So I guess some might say that the government actually has a duty to take steps to protect
*  the citizens of this country, and you seem to be suggesting that that duty cannot manifest
*  itself in the government encouraging or even pressuring platforms to take down harmful
*  information.
*  So can you help me?
*  Because I'm really worried about that, because you've got the First Amendment operating.
*  In an environment of threatening circumstances from the government's perspective, and you're
*  saying that the government can't interact with the source of those problems.
*  And the Environmental Protection Agency announced a total ban on asbestos.
*  The carcinogen had been largely prohibited in previous environmental orders, but chrysotile
*  asbestos had been permitted until this latest ban and is used in a range of products, including
*  brake linings, gaskets and in chlorine bleach and sodium hydroxide production.
*  It's been found to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma and other cancers and is linked to over 40,000
*  U.S. deaths each year.
*  And those are some of the headlines.

*  Thank you.
