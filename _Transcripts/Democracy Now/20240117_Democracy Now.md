# Top U.S. & World Headlines — January 17, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrWBaKi86zI)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, DemocracyNow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Pakistan has condemned Iran for violating its airspace and killing two children in air
*  attacks less than a day after Iranian attacks in Iraqi Kurdistan killed at least four people.
*  Iranian media said two bases of the Jais-e-Adl militants in Balochistan were destroyed late
*  Tuesday, though there has been no official confirmation from Tehran of its responsibility.
*  Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Iran and said the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan
*  would be barred from returning.
*  This comes amidst escalating tensions that are spreading throughout the Middle East.
*  The U.S. carried out its third strike against Yemen's Houthi forces Tuesday.
*  The White House also announced its re-designating the Houthi militia as a terrorist group and
*  reimposing penalties on the Iran-backed group in retaliation for their attacks in the Red
*  Sea, which have led to no casualties but have disrupted global trade.
*  The groups vowed to continue its campaign in the Red Sea as long as Israel continues
*  to attack Gaza.
*  On Tuesday, a Greek vessel headed to Israel was hit by a Houthi missile.
*  We'll have more on the possibility of a wider conflict later in the broadcast.
*  In Gaza, displaced civilians are again fleeing as intense Israeli bombardment rains down
*  including the area around its main hospital, al-Nasser.
*  Israeli ground forces have also been reported in the area.
*  Overnight, Palestinian journalist Bisan Alda was able to post a video from the hospital
*  despite a five-day-long communications blackout.
*  Bisan Alda said she feared it could be her final update.
*  The medical staff, the ambulances, many people also evacuated the hospital, and that's
*  so dangerous.
*  This is the last functioning hospital in Gaza.
*  That means that thousands of injuries are still now alone in the hospital.
*  Displaced people are alone in the hospital.
*  They are besieged.
*  We are besieged.
*  I don't know if I can survive this or go anywhere.
*  I'm just alone, alone as thousands, alone as many in other hospitals were before.
*  Bisan Alda did survive the night and called on her followers to observe a global strike
*  against the war next week.
*  Qatar and France have brokered a deal for medicine to enter Gaza for the remaining Israeli
*  hostages in exchange for aid for Palestinians.
*  This comes amidst a worsening humanitarian catastrophe as a U.N. rights expert asserted,
*  quote,
*  "'Every single person in Gaza is hungry.'
*  The death toll has topped 24,000."
*  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said Tuesday Saudi Arabia could recognize
*  Israel if the conflicts resolved and includes Palestinian statehood.
*  Israel's deadly attacks on the occupied West Bank continue, with at least seven Palestinians
*  killed over the past day.
*  On Tuesday, mourners attended the funeral of 21-year-old Ahed Mohammed Indura near the
*  West Bank city of Hebron, after she was killed during an Israeli raid Monday.
*  This is her sister.
*  Ahed was martyred here on the rooftop of her parents-in-law's house, where there was supposed
*  to be a wedding next Friday.
*  In our tradition, people come to arrange stuff for the bride.
*  This is why Ahed was here.
*  Ahed has a six-month-old daughter.
*  Her name is Ayul.
*  She left Ayul behind.
*  She left her to be a daughter of a martyr, with no memories with her mother, because
*  they didn't have the chance to make memories together.
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed some 350 West Bank Palestinians
*  since October 7th.
*  In addition, at least 94 houses have been destroyed across the occupied territory, displacing
*  602 Palestinians, including 263 children, since October 7th.
*  That's according to the United Nations.
*  On Monday, an elderly Israeli woman was killed and 17 people injured, including children,
*  after a ramming and stabbing attack in the central Israeli city of Raanana.
*  A Palestinian man and his nephew have been detained as suspects.
*  Here in the United States, senators voted against a resolution advanced by Senator Bernie
*  Sanders Tuesday that would have required the Biden administration to provide Congress with
*  the report on how U.S. arms are being used in Israel and its human rights violations
*  in Palestine.
*  Just 11 senators back Sanders' measure.
*  Of the 11 backers, only three have called for a ceasefire in Gaza—Elizabeth Warren
*  of Massachusetts, Peter Welch and Jeff Merkley.
*  Dick Durbin is the fourth U.S. senator to call for a ceasefire.
*  Ben & Jerry's ice cream has joined calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in
*  Gaza.
*  Ben & Jerry's board chair, Anuradha Mittal, said in an interview with The Financial Times,
*  the ice cream company is long stood by the principle of peace.
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, some 130 Mennonite protesters were arrested Tuesday during a
*  peaceful sit-in in the Cannon House office building.
*  Demonstrators sang hymns and chanted, Let Gaza Live.
*  Meanwhile, in the latest crackdown by U.S. colleges on Palestinian voices, Indiana University
*  canceled the first U.S. retrospective of renowned artist Samia Halebi.
*  Halebi, who is an Indiana University alum, was informed her social media posts on the
*  Israeli assault expressing solidarity with Gazans under attack was the reason for the
*  cancellation.
*  The exhibition had been in the works for over three years.
*  Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott is facing more condemnation for his support of anti-immigrant
*  and border enforcement policies that led to the recent deaths of another three asylum
*  seekers attempting to cross the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass.
*  The mother and her two young children have been identified as 33-year-old Victor De La
*  Sanchez Seros, Yorlay Ruby and Yonatan Augustin Breones De La Sanchez, who were 10 and 8 years
*  old.
*  They were from Mexico.
*  Their drowning Friday came just days after Texas troopers took over about two and a half
*  miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, including Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, a city park on
*  the banks of the Rio Grande, denying access to U.S. border patrol attempting to respond
*  to rescue calls.
*  The area has also been blocked off with fencing, gates and razor wire.
*  The Biden administration has given Governor Abbott until today to remove the barriers
*  the justice department, Friday, petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene against
*  Texas.
*  Texas Congressmember Joaquin Castro said, quote,
*  "'This is what Operation Lone Star looks like on the ground.
*  Texas officials block border patrol agents from doing their job and allow two children
*  to drown in the Rio Grande.
*  Governor Abbott's inhumanity has no limit.
*  Everyone who enables his cruelty has blood on their hands,' Castro said.
*  By partisan, Congressmembers agreed to a $78 billion short-term funding bill that would
*  avert a partial government shutdown Friday while expanding the child tax credit and restoring
*  business tax breaks, among other things.
*  The deal was put forward by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee,
*  and Republican Jason Smith, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.
*  But it's not clear if the measure can garner enough support to pass.
*  Some Democrats say the child tax credit doesn't go far enough and are pushing for the same
*  deal as during the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan.
*  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecasts the plan would lift some 400,000
*  children out of poverty in its first year.
*  Meanwhile, President Biden is expected to meet with congressional leaders at the White
*  House today amidst deadlock talks over his request for $100 billion in supplemental funding
*  for Ukraine and Israel's military and Taiwan, which Republicans have insisted be tied to
*  further militarizing the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  The U.N.'s human rights office is calling on Alabama to halt its first planned execution
*  of a prisoner using nitrogen gas asphyxiation later this month.
*  We have serious concerns that Smith's execution in these circumstances could breach the prohibition
*  on torture or other cruel and human or degrading treatment or punishment, as well as his right
*  to effective remedies.
*  These are rights that are set out in two international human rights treaties that the U.S. is bound
*  by.
*  Kenneth Eugene Smith is scheduled to be executed next Thursday, January 25th, after losing
*  his appeal at the Alabama Supreme Court.
*  In November 2022, prison officials called off another execution attempt against Smith
*  after they were unable to establish an IV line for his lethal injection.
*  Smith's lawyers argued subjecting him to a second execution attempt constitutes cruel
*  and unusual punishment.
*  In D.C., the Capitol Police and FBI are investigating statements attributed to longtime Trump associate
*  Roger Stone, who reportedly said two top Democratic lawmakers and Trump critics have
*  to die weeks before the 2020 election.
*  The website Mediaite reports the comments targeting Congress members Eric Swalwell and
*  Jerry Nadler were made to Stone associate Salvatore Greco, a former New York City policeman,
*  and posted audio of the encounter.
*  Either Swalwell or Nadler has to die before the election.
*  They need to get the message, says the recording.
*  Mediaite reports an unnamed source believed Stone was, quote, not joking around.
*  Roger Stone has dismissed the reports and the recording as A.I. manipulation.
*  When his world leaders are gathering in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum,
*  Oxfam issued a new report showing the world's five richest billionaires have seen their
*  wealth double over the past four years, while five billion others have become poorer.
*  Oxfam is predicting the world could have its first trillionaire in a decade.
*  Oxfam's interim executive director Amitabh Behar spoke in Davos.
*  Very often when we are here at the World Economic Forum, you end up celebrating billionaires.
*  But I think it's a sign of failure that we have 800 million people, 10% of the global
*  population, sleeping hungry.
*  They do not have enough food to eat.
*  800 million people.
*  And on the other hand, you have these billionaires with their private yachts, private jets, and
*  a lifestyle which cannot even be understood.
