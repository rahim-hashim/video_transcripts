# The Belmarsh Tribunal D.C. — The Case of Julian Assange
**Democracy Now!:** [January 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_QqpYATupw)
*  Welcome to the Belmarsh Tribunal.
*  I want to welcome all the people in this room,
*  a particularly significant room,
*  given that it was here almost exactly 13 years ago,
*  that Julian Assange released
*  his collateral murder video of WikiLeaks.
*  I'll talk about that in a moment.
*  But thank you to all of you,
*  as well as all of the people who are viewing on
*  the democracynow.org live stream people around the world.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, host of Democracy Now,
*  which airs on 1,500 public television
*  and radio stations around the world,
*  and on the internet at democracynow.org.
*  It is absolutely critical that as journalists,
*  we speak out on this critical issue of press freedom.
*  The Belmarsh Tribunal was convened by
*  the Progressive International and the Wow Holland Foundation,
*  and brought to you live by Democracy Now.
*  The Belmarsh Tribunal sits for the fourth time
*  today here in Washington, D.C.,
*  to hear testimony from a range of expert witnesses,
*  from constitutional lawyers to acclaimed journalists,
*  whistleblowers, human rights defenders, and a dad,
*  to the ongoing attack on press freedom
*  and the First Amendment.
*  The Belmarsh Tribunal was inspired by
*  the Nobel Prize-winning British philosopher Bertrand Russell
*  and the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre
*  and Simone de Beauvoir and others.
*  First, the Tribunal was established in 1966,
*  when representatives of 18 countries
*  gathered to hold the United States accountable
*  for war crimes in Vietnam,
*  in the absence of an international authority to do so.
*  Today, the Tribunal pursues justice for the global campaign
*  against the suppression of dissent,
*  and it pursues justice for journalists
*  who are imprisoned or persecuted,
*  publishers, whistleblowers,
*  who dare to reveal the crimes of our governments.
*  From Ankara to Manila to Budapest
*  to right here in the United States,
*  state actors are cracking down on journalists,
*  their sources, their publishers,
*  in a globally coordinated campaign
*  to disrupt the public's access to information.
*  It's not just critical to talk about freedom of the press,
*  but it's critical to talk about the right of the public
*  to have access to information.
*  That is why freedom of the press is so important.
*  A landmark case in this campaign is that of Julian Assange,
*  the publisher who founded WikiLeaks,
*  exposed crimes by the United States government
*  and now faces 175 years in prison,
*  if extradited by Britain, from the Belmarsh Prison,
*  where he is currently being held.
*  Assange's case is the first time in history
*  that a publisher has been indicted under the Espionage Act.
*  Recently, it was revealed the CIA
*  had been spying illegally on Julian,
*  his lawyers, and some members of this very tribunal.
*  The CIA even plotted his assassination
*  at the Ecuadorian embassy under President Trump.
*  Julian Assange made one of the most explosive revelations
*  right here, not only at the National Press Club,
*  but right here in this room,
*  and we will show images of his news conference.
*  In fact, on Democracy Now!,
*  we interviewed him the following morning.
*  Right here at the National Press Club,
*  he released Collateral Murder,
*  what WikiLeaks called this videotape,
*  which showed harrowing footage of a U.S. Apache helicopter
*  assassinating civilians and journalists in Iraq.
*  I want to talk about that moment,
*  that crime that was documented,
*  not by peace activists on the ground,
*  but by the military itself,
*  the footage coming from the Apache helicopter itself.
*  It was July 12th, 2007,
*  an area of Baghdad called New Baghdad.
*  Men were walking by below the helicopter unit.
*  They called back to base,
*  the soldiers in the Apache helicopter, they weren't rogue.
*  They asked for permission to engage, and they opened fire.
*  They killed Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists,
*  Namir Noor Eldin, an up-and-coming 22-year-old videographer,
*  and his driver, the Iraqi, Saeed Shema, father of four.
*  Saeed didn't die immediately, he was crawling away,
*  having been injured, a white van pulls up,
*  a dad with his two kids taking them to school.
*  The helicopter blows up the van,
*  as well as kills Saeed Shema, the kids are critically injured.
*  Now, I dare say this would never have happened
*  if six months before, in February of 2007,
*  something that appeared in the Iraq war logs
*  that WikiLeaks released had been exposed at the time.
*  Why standing up for press freedom,
*  free flow of information is so important.
*  It was then that the same helicopter unit,
*  Apache unit flying overhead, saw two men below.
*  They were putting up their hands in a surrender sign.
*  They called back to base, they spoke to the lawyer,
*  and they got permission to attack, and they killed them.
*  People gasp in this room, as anyone would,
*  and if we knew that at the time,
*  if we had that information, why it's so critical to have,
*  I dare say an investigation would have been launched,
*  and what happened six months later in New Baghdad
*  with that attack that Reuters had appealed for for years
*  under the Freedom of Information Act to get that video
*  to find out what happened to their staff and were denied.
*  I dare say that attack would not have happened
*  because we would have known about it before.
*  That's why freedom of the press,
*  the free flow of information saves lives,
*  and that's what we're going to be talking about today.
*  President Joseph Biden has continued to enforce
*  the stance of the Trump administration before him,
*  calling for Assange's extradition.
*  US Congress and the White House otherwise
*  have remained largely silent, although belatedly,
*  the New York Times, The Guardian, El País,
*  Der Spiegel, and Le Monde have called
*  for the Biden administration to drop the charges.
*  Today we're gonna hear from an illustrious group of people,
*  including the British parliamentarian, Jeremy Corbyn.
*  Noam.
*  (*audience applauds*)
*  We'll be hearing in person and also in video
*  going back and forth.
*  Noam Chomsky, the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizzi,
*  Daniel Olsberg, the world's most famous whistleblower,
*  the critically important Betty Metzger
*  who exposed Cointelpro.
*  (*audience applauds*)
*  I wonder if she was doing this today,
*  if she would be in prison.
*  Steve Donziger, who knows about prison,
*  the US attorney, and more.
*  But first I'm gonna introduce the co-chair
*  of today's panel, Srećko Horvat.
*  (*audience applauds*)
*  Thanks a lot, Amy.
*  It is a great honor to be here today
*  at the National Press Club at the very place
*  where a very courageous publisher,
*  one of the most courageous publishers in the world
*  in our contemporary history, revealed American war crimes.
*  WikiLeaks revealed war crimes,
*  and Julian Assange is for almost four years in prison,
*  in a prison which is called Belmarsh Prison,
*  while those who committed the war crimes are still free.
*  I come from a country which unfortunately
*  had the experience of a bloody war, namely ex-Yugoslavia,
*  and you know, collateral murder was published in 2007,
*  now it's 15 years.
*  It was published in 2010, but the atrocities happened
*  in 2007, and now it's 15 years since that crime,
*  and I don't know whether anyone ended up in prison
*  or if anyone was charged or convicted.
*  In ex-Yugoslavia, 15 years after the war,
*  some war criminals actually were convicted.
*  Some died in prison, some are still free,
*  some are unfortunately still in power.
*  In the United States, no one was convicted,
*  some died without being charged or convicted.
*  Most of the war criminals of these war crimes
*  which you could have seen in collateral murder
*  and other publications of WikiLeaks are still free,
*  and others are powerful members of your society.
*  And this is the reason why the Belmarsh Tribunal
*  is coming to Washington, D.C.,
*  just two blocks away from the White House.
*  It's called Belmarsh as you can imagine
*  because we called it after the prison
*  where Julian Assange is still being held.
*  We had several tribunals already,
*  one in London, one in New York City.
*  Members of the tribunal included Edward Snowden,
*  another hero, Rafael Correa, President Lula,
*  Yanis Varoufakis, and many others.
*  Today we are here two blocks from the White House
*  to focus on the crimes of the U.S. government
*  committed against the freedom of press,
*  against journalism, against the First Amendment,
*  and against Julian Assange.
*  It is the first time that the publisher is being charged
*  under this very anachronistic law,
*  namely the Espionage Act, which comes,
*  as you know better than me, from 1917,
*  which is a wartime document,
*  and you think your country is progressive.
*  You still have a law which is more than 100 years old
*  from the First World War.
*  I mean, I have to say that as an outsider to this country.
*  As Bertolt Brecht said,
*  a country is sad which needs heroes,
*  and the United States is really sad
*  if someone like me has to come from Croatia
*  to talk about the First Amendment.
*  It's...
*  As you know, Julian Assange has been targeted
*  by the most powerful institutions in the world,
*  by American institutions, by the CIA, by the NSA,
*  and by the Pentagon, who plotted to kill him
*  or to kidnap him from British soil.
*  And after 12 years of persecution,
*  almost four years in prison,
*  of what the United Nations characterized
*  as arbitrary detention,
*  he now faces 175 years in a supermax prison
*  in the United States.
*  For what?
*  For publishing the truth,
*  for publishing facts about war crimes of your government.
*  For publishing the truth and secrets
*  about the CIA program of surveillance of you,
*  my dear fellow American citizens.
*  So we are here today, among other reasons,
*  to remind President Biden
*  of what the presidential candidate Biden said in 2020.
*  Quote, reporters without borders tell us
*  that at least 360 people worldwide
*  are currently imprisoned for their work in journalism.
*  We all stand in solidarity with these journalists
*  for, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1786,
*  quote, our liberty depends on the freedom of the press,
*  and that cannot be limited without being lost.
*  Now, I'm not really a big fan of Jefferson,
*  given the fact that the same guy you Americans
*  celebrate even today owned more than 600 slaves.
*  And in the same way Jefferson was nominally opposed
*  to slavery but owned slaves,
*  President Biden is normally advocating freedom of press,
*  but at the same time continuing the persecution
*  of Julian Assange.
*  Today, we gathered in Washington, D.C.
*  to demand President Biden to drop the charges
*  against Julian Assange
*  if he really wants to protect freedom of press
*  and the First Amendment.
*  In the meantime, while Julian Assange is still in prison,
*  all major newspapers of the world
*  have demanded the same, to drop the charges.
*  The Guardian, The New York Times, Spiegel,
*  LPA, and Le Monde.
*  All major human rights organizations demanded the same,
*  to drop the charges.
*  And even the United Nations called Julian Assange
*  prolonged detention torture.
*  I'm honored to be co-chairing today's tribunal
*  with Amy Goodman, a great source of inspiration,
*  and I'm happy to welcome all the members of our tribunal
*  and you, the audience who is here in a big number
*  and everyone who is watching us today.
*  And by this, I officially proclaim the tribunal launched.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  We'll move right into the tribunal members.
*  Ben Weisner is the director of the ACOU's
*  Speech Privacy and Technology Project.
*  He's been at the ACOU for 20 years,
*  has worked at the intersection of civil liberties
*  and national security,
*  litigating numerous cases involving
*  airport security policies, government watch lists,
*  surveillance practices, targeted killing, and torture.
*  He's testified before Congress as an adjunct professor
*  at New York University School of Law.
*  And since 2013, Ben Weisner has been the principal
*  legal advisor to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.
*  Ben.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Amy.
*  Thank you, friends, for being here in this room today
*  to talk about this most important case.
*  About a half a century ago, in fact,
*  the very week that I was born, just a few blocks from here,
*  the Supreme Court heard and then decided
*  the case of the Pentagon Papers,
*  and we'll all be hearing from the Pentagon Papers
*  whistleblower Edward Snowden.
*  And we'll all be hearing from the Pentagon Papers
*  whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg a little bit later
*  this afternoon.
*  In the half century that has passed from then until now,
*  there has been no greater threat to press freedom
*  than United States versus Julian Assange.
*  And you'll hear quite a bit today
*  about the freedom of the man.
*  My comments will be about the freedom of the press
*  to fulfill its necessary constitutional role
*  in any democracy.
*  No government in any kind of system
*  will voluntarily disclose its own crimes.
*  For that, we need brave sources who have firsthand evidence,
*  and we need a free press and brave publishers
*  who are willing to bring this information to the people
*  to whom it belongs.
*  Now, in this case, the government characterizes
*  that collaboration between a courageous source
*  and a courageous publisher as a conspiracy.
*  Of course it was a conspiracy.
*  Good investigative journalism is always a conspiracy.
*  It's a conspiracy to end the monopoly on information
*  that governments control and to give people the seat
*  at the table that they must have in order for us
*  to be able to judge powerful people
*  and hold them accountable.
*  I...
*  But this is the first time, as you've heard already today
*  under the century-long history of the Espionage Act
*  that the government has charged this kind of collaboration
*  as a criminal conspiracy.
*  And this is vitally important, remember,
*  without sources like Chelsea Manning, like Edward Snowden,
*  without publishers like WikiWeeks and the partners
*  that it worked with to bring this information forward.
*  What would we have not have known?
*  Just over the course of my career,
*  we would not have known that prisoners were tortured
*  and sexually humiliated at Abu Ghraib.
*  We would not have known that the CIA set up
*  an archipelago of dungeons where people were held
*  incommunicado and subjected to barbaric treatment.
*  We wouldn't have known that any innocent person
*  ever died in a drone strike.
*  We wouldn't have known that governments developed
*  and deployed systems of mass surveillance
*  without the consent or knowledge of the public.
*  These are all things that governments classified
*  at the absolute highest level of secrecy,
*  and yet can anyone really say that the public
*  in a democracy doesn't have a right to know
*  or a need to know any of the things that I have just said?
*  If this prosecution goes forward and ends in conviction,
*  it will be a very dark day for press freedom
*  in the United States.
*  The prosecution has already had a chilling effect
*  in newsrooms around the country.
*  The lawyers for publications are already assessing
*  the risks of publishing certain information
*  in a way that they never had before.
*  But let's not just focus on the threat
*  to press freedom in the United States
*  because this is an attack on press freedom globally.
*  And that's because the United States is advancing
*  what I think is really the extraordinary claim
*  that it can impose US criminal secrecy laws
*  on a foreign publisher who is publishing
*  outside the United States.
*  Let's think about that for a second.
*  Let's linger on that for a second.
*  This is opening an incredible Pandora's box.
*  Every country has secrecy laws.
*  Some countries have very draconian secrecy laws.
*  If those countries tried to extradite New York Times
*  reporters and publishers to those countries
*  for publishing their secrets,
*  we would cry foul and rightly so.
*  Does this administration want to be the first
*  to establish the global precedent
*  that countries can demand the extradition
*  of foreign reporters and publishers
*  for violating their own laws?
*  I truly hope not.
*  And let me wrap up by saying that a country
*  in which a publisher has been extradited and imprisoned
*  for publishing truthful information
*  will be a very different country
*  than the one that we have lived in our whole lives.
*  And let's make sure that we do everything possible
*  to make sure that we don't become that country.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  It is my great pleasure to announce the next speaker,
*  Jeffrey Sterling, who is an American lawyer
*  and former CIA employee, who was arrested, charged
*  and convicted of violating the Espionage Act.
*  Please, Jeffrey, join the stage.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  It is an absolute honor to be here today
*  here at the Press Club.
*  Years ago, my wife spoke on my behalf
*  about the injustice that happened to me.
*  I spent two and a half years in prison
*  after being wrongfully convicted
*  on no evidence of violating the Espionage Act.
*  It was a travesty of a trial.
*  And that sentence was held up as a shining example
*  of the reasonableness and fairness
*  that Julian Assange will face being tried here
*  for violating that same Espionage Act.
*  I remain sickened to this day that my persecution
*  was held up as the benchmark of what Julian Assange
*  is going to face in trial here.
*  Of course, the benchmarks they did not talk about
*  include my experience fighting against the Espionage Act,
*  a biased criminal justice system,
*  and the realities of being behind bars
*  here in the United States.
*  I can tell you that any claims of fair or humane treatment
*  in store for Julian Assange here
*  within our criminal justice system
*  and prisons where outright lies.
*  But I would like to focus on the law
*  that Julian Assange has supposedly violated.
*  First and foremost, it is virtually impossible
*  to defend against the Espionage Act.
*  Truth is no defense.
*  In fact, any defense related to truth will be prohibited.
*  In addition, he won't have access
*  to any of the so-called evidence used against him.
*  And to make it even more difficult,
*  the government doesn't have to show any harm.
*  It is a law and prosecution
*  in which the government says what it wants.
*  It's a because we say so law,
*  not to be questioned, not to be challenged.
*  The trial will be nothing more than an affirmation
*  and continuation of the character assassination
*  that the government has launched against Julian Assange
*  from the moment that he spoke up.
*  So, but what are we really talking about here?
*  I mean, what is this law, the Espionage Act
*  that he's accused of violating
*  and that I was accused of violating?
*  You know, we're led to believe that Julian
*  and other whistleblowers are threats
*  to the national security of this country,
*  hence being charged with violating the Espionage Act.
*  But I'm living proof of what national security
*  actually means here in the United States.
*  Here's a real benchmark they don't tell you about.
*  In my example, I sued the CIA for racial discrimination
*  because they said I was too big and black
*  to serve my country.
*  According to the government in that instance,
*  and upheld by the same courts
*  that they're intending to try Julian Assange,
*  was that a black man fighting for his constitutional rights
*  is a threat to national security.
*  Not a surprise, really.
*  One of the original and enduring threats
*  to the national security of this country
*  is and has always been African Americans.
*  And to punish me as an African American
*  for having the audacity to sue the CIA,
*  I was falsely accused of and put on trial
*  for violating the Espionage Act
*  and by default, our national security.
*  The only evidence needed to convict me
*  was the color of my skin.
*  Julian won't be afforded any so-called
*  constitutional rights that I had.
*  What chance is he going to have to fight against
*  his charges of violating the Espionage Act?
*  Now when I think about how national security
*  dictated that I can be blatantly discriminated against,
*  it painfully reminds me of the horrors of slavery
*  and the laws that were designed to preserve it.
*  When examining the Espionage Act and how it's being used,
*  it's not unreasonable to be reminded of the
*  anti-literacy laws that were enforced
*  during slavery in this country.
*  Those laws were used to prevent educating slaves
*  because of the fear that an educated slave population
*  would threaten the nation's security.
*  Keeping us uneducated and ignorant
*  was a tenet of national security then
*  and we see the same thing with how the Espionage Act
*  is being used now against whistleblowers
*  and against Julian Assange.
*  Truly, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
*  (*applause*)
*  When we look at it, the Espionage Act is no different
*  than those anti-slavery laws.
*  They both represent and they are the very embodiment
*  of white supremacism that has always been a part
*  of the identity and governance of this country.
*  The Espionage Act has not been used to fight espionage.
*  It's being used against whistleblowers and Julian Assange
*  to keep the subjugated ignorant of its wrongdoings
*  and illegalities in order to maintain its hold on authority,
*  all in the name of national security.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  None of the Espionage Act prosecutions have or are even
*  allowed to examine the truth of the matter brought to light
*  by the whistleblower.
*  The focus is always only on what was done
*  for the sake of education and accountability.
*  The white slave owners knew the truth.
*  An educated slave won't be a slave for long.
*  That is what this Espionage Act is about.
*  What this endless persecution of Assange
*  and whistleblowers everywhere has always been about,
*  all in the name, again, of national security.
*  And thanks to complicity like from the United Kingdom,
*  who has been all too willing to serve Julian up to the US,
*  that same ideology is expanding beyond the bounds of slavery
*  and fomenting racial discord in this country
*  to reach perceived threats anywhere
*  under perfidious claims of national security.
*  I think it compelling that this tribunal is happening
*  the same week that the nation celebrates the life
*  and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
*  When he said in the letter from a Birmingham jail
*  that one has a moral responsibility
*  to disobey unjust laws, he was talking about laws
*  like the Espionage Act.
*  What makes the Espionage Act unjust
*  is that it is not being used to protect this nation.
*  It does not apply to the power brokers in this nation.
*  It is being used to keep us all slaves.
*  It is therefore an unjust law and should be disobeyed.
*  The most immediate and meaningful way
*  this wrongful law can be disobeyed
*  is by the release of Julian Assange.
*  The US government has already demonstrated
*  a boundless intent to persecute
*  those who dare reveal its transgressions
*  and it won't end with Julian Assange.
*  Free the man.
*  None of us will be free until he is released
*  and the Espionage Act is abolished.
*  Set the man free.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Our next speaker by video is Katrina Vanden Heuvel.
*  Katrina is editorial director and publisher
*  of the Nation Magazine and writes a weekly column
*  in the Washington Post.
*  A frequent commentator on many networks
*  including ABC, MSNBC, CNN, PBS.
*  Her articles have appeared in newspapers
*  in this country and around the world.
*  The nation's journalism has been given many awards
*  including those from the Society of Professional Journalists,
*  National Magazine Awards.
*  This is Katrina Vanden Heuvel.
*  I'm honored to join today.
*  I'm publisher of The Nation,
*  America's oldest weekly founded in 1865
*  by abolitionists committed to ending the scourge of slavery.
*  Time and again since then,
*  writers for The Nation have identified threats to privacy
*  and liberty, the dangers of hyper security, surveillance,
*  long before they were acknowledged
*  by the mainstream media and the broader public.
*  The nation remains vigilant,
*  committed to keeping watch on the watchers,
*  the patriotiers, the securitrats,
*  those who worry more about national embarrassment
*  than national security.
*  We abide by the belief that holding government accountable
*  is central to the mission of a free and independent press
*  and a true democracy.
*  Our democracy is fragile today
*  because as the nation has argued since its founding,
*  endless wars do not contribute
*  to democracy at home.
*  There's a lot of talk today about the rules based order.
*  Whose rules?
*  The rules that give us still preeminent endless wars,
*  believe we're preeminent in a multipolar world,
*  have the authority to lecture the world
*  on issues of press freedom.
*  Three successive administrations in this country
*  have mercilessly gone after Jolene Assange.
*  The persecution and prosecution of Assange
*  undermine US efforts to promote the cause
*  of press freedom internationally.
*  The Biden administration,
*  if it's serious about its commitment
*  to media freedom in the world,
*  could lead by example
*  and have more than decade long
*  of persecution and persecution of Jolene Assange.
*  It is not necessary to make Assange a hero
*  in order to vigorously oppose his prosecution.
*  It is necessary to reject the project
*  of successive presidential administrations
*  that if seen through to the conclusions
*  that a gravely dangerous precedent
*  for prosecuting journalists and publishers.
*  I've thought a good deal about the threats
*  faced by journalism in the 21st century.
*  There are many, but few are so serious
*  as the criminalization of speaking truth to power.
*  By the way, those in power already know the truth
*  and they often hide it from us.
*  The Biden administration must end years
*  of politically motivated prosecution of Assange
*  by at long last dropping the charges against him.
*  The criminalization of whistleblowers
*  and investigative journalism
*  have no place in a democracy.
*  Free Assange, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm really happy that I can now announce
*  our next member of tribunal, Margaret Kunstler,
*  the legendary American Civil Rights attorney
*  who has spent her whole career providing support
*  and protecting the rights of activists.
*  She was the co-chair of the Belmarsh Tribunal
*  together with me in New York City.
*  But this time, she's coming to this stage,
*  to this room, to Washington DC as a witness
*  to speak about the lawsuit against the CIA.
*  Please, Margaret, join us.
*  Well, I'm not only deeply involved in this lawsuit as a witness, but I am deeply involved
*  in this lawsuit as a plaintiff.
*  And there are many people who perhaps who are not with us today who would be very happy
*  to hear that the name of the lawsuit was Consular Against Pompeo.
*  And one of the major things, this is going to be a narrow topic, so I hope you'll understand
*  that this is not a massive defense of Julian.
*  But this is a lawsuit that we hope will, in fact, be one of the major ingredients about
*  why the United States cannot try Julian in this country.
*  They cannot try Julian in this country because they've overdone their misconduct.
*  They've engaged in the level of misconduct in interfering in the defense of Julian Assange
*  that cannot be tolerated.
*  It's brought in this country so that people can understand just the tip of the iceberg
*  about what has been done to Julian Assange, the actions that have been taken against him.
*  Here lawyers, doctors, and other professionals who visited Julian Assange, their conversations
*  were recorded, but more than that, their equipment was taken, their telephones, and their computers,
*  and they were gone through.
*  Now this started happening in 2017.
*  Before that, we had thought that the surveillance of the embassy was to protect Julian, but
*  we found out through a lawsuit that was brought in Spain that starting in 2017, the type of
*  surveillance that was going on had completely changed.
*  Now the surveillance was on a level that has been unheard of in this country and unheard
*  of anywhere in the world, that you would record and take information about conversations,
*  about what plans were being drawn up, about specifically about the health of Julian, and
*  about what was going to be the defensive trial.
*  Now you're not allowed to do this.
*  This absolutely violates the concept of justice in this country.
*  What caused this?
*  How did we reach this level of hatred, of disobeying of law when it comes to Julian Assange?
*  Well, it's significant that it began in 2017 because that was the year that Pompeo came
*  into authority.
*  And Pompeo's very first speech was that he considered Julian and WikiLeaks a non-state
*  hostile intelligence agency.
*  Now to say that was an explanation that Julian had no rights left to him, that they could
*  go in, they could kill him, anything they wanted to do was fair game.
*  And that is something that is so astounding to our level of understanding of justice in
*  this country, that that was the cause of this lawsuit.
*  He allowed what happened to happen.
*  And his effect was so outrageous that he deserves to really suffer under this lawsuit, and I
*  don't know that he's going to suffer enough.
*  He was served in an embarrassing way, and he was very unhappy about how he was served.
*  He was served publicly, and we got footage of him being served, and we were very thrilled
*  about that.
*  But this lawsuit is not only a lawsuit about how far that the government can go, but it
*  also is an example of what they have carried out against Julian all along.
*  The attitudes towards Julian, the use of the press to indict him illegally, all of the
*  things that the searches that have been done of his lawyers, all of the actions that have
*  been carried against him, which were co-intel pro actions that you'll hear about later on,
*  the co-intel pro was used against Julian.
*  And he is considered an enemy and treated as an enemy in the most, where he hasn't committed
*  any crime.
*  The only thing he has done is reveal the truth.
*  And to have someone suffer and to treat someone so vilely for telling the truth is really
*  astounding.
*  And we hope that this lawsuit will reach out to people in this country and begin to explain
*  to them what has been done to Julian Assange.
*  And we hope that it will have an effect that a lawsuit cannot be brought, that Julian will
*  not be extradited and he will not be tried in this country, and he will be freed because
*  he should be.
*  Next up, Stefania Maurizzi.
*  She's an investigative journalist currently contributing to the major Italian daily, El
*  Fatto Codidiano, after working for the last 14 years for La Repubblica, consistently rated
*  among the top two Italian newspapers, and for L'Espresso, the most important Italian
*  news magazine.
*  Stefania worked with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks since 2009, teaming up with teams of international
*  media to cover and investigate all WikiLeaks secret documents, from the secret files on
*  the war in Afghanistan called the Afghan War Logs to the US diplomacy cables, Cablegate,
*  from the files on the Guantanamo prisoners called Gitmo files, on up to the most recent
*  revelations about the European military mission against boats traveling from Libya to Italy,
*  smuggling migrants and refugees, and the espionage activities against French and European
*  leaders by the National Security Agency.
*  Her book is just out in English.
*  It's called Secret Power, WikiLeaks and Its Enemies.
*  This is Stefania.
*  It is a great honor to be a member of this Belmarsh Tribunal.
*  As an investigative journalist, I'm not here to make any grand statement about this case.
*  I'm here to provide some solid evidence, I would say forensic evidence, of extremely
*  suspicious facts about the persecution of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.
*  I have been there since the very beginning.
*  My first media partnership with WikiLeaks was in 2009, and since then I have worked
*  on all their documentation.
*  I can assure you that this work hasn't gained me any powerful friends in high places.
*  Quite the opposite.
*  It set me on a collision course with my former newspaper, from which I had to resign in order
*  to keep doing my work on WikiLeaks.
*  What I have seen in the course of my journalistic work on this case has deeply disturbed me.
*  I have been stunned by the state criminality documented in the files, by the impunity that
*  war criminals and torturers enjoy in our democracies.
*  I have been shocked that whistleblowers and journalists who reveal war crimes do not have
*  a place to hide in our democratic societies.
*  From 2010 on, Assange sought every possible refuge.
*  He shut himself in an embassy and sought protection in asylum.
*  He knocked at the door of the United Nations working group.
*  He knocked at the door at the UN Special Rapporteur on torture.
*  Nothing and no one was able to prevent the ruin of his physical and mental health.
*  That is why I have engaged in a trench warfare, I call trench warfare, to unearth the truth
*  about this case, litigating an FOI case in the United States, in the United Kingdom,
*  Sweden and Australia represented by seven lawyers, because four governments not just
*  denying me access to this documentation, but they have used all legal resources and tactics
*  to prevent me to access this documentation.
*  I'm sure you know that in the current attempt to extradite Julian Assange from the United
*  Kingdom to the United States, the US authorities are acting through a public authority, British
*  public authority called the Crown Prosecution Service.
*  This is the very same authority through which the Swedish prosecutor tried to extradite
*  Julian Assange in connection with the rape allegations.
*  The Swedish investigation was dropped once and for all in 2019 after remaining in the
*  preliminary stage for nine years with no charge whatsoever.
*  My FOI litigation has allowed revealing that it was the Crown Prosecution Service that
*  trapped Julian Assange in a legal and diplomatic quagmire which has kept him arbitrarily detained
*  for a decade.
*  Why did they provide this legal advice?
*  It was an advice that destroyed any chance of justice for anyone.
*  It cost the British taxpayers £13.2 million and it basically destroyed his health and
*  his physical and mental health.
*  When I tried to dig into this, I discovered incredible things like that the Crown Prosecution
*  Service destroyed key documents about the Swedish case.
*  Why did they do so?
*  They did it when Sir Keir Starmer was heading the Crown Prosecution Service.
*  I discovered this in November 2017.
*  I shared this information with the Guardian Pulitzer Prize, Ewan McCaskill, and we published
*  this revelation.
*  A month after these revelations, I went to the embassy to discuss this with Julian Assange.
*  I discovered that my devices were secretly accessed, my phone unscrewed, and the SIM
*  card extracted, and our conversation recorded, and so on.
*  Nothing is normal in this case.
*  Nothing is normal.
*  In the United States, Australia, and Sweden, I have run up against the same pushback when
*  last year I appealed to the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman for an investigation into the highly
*  anomalous handling of the documentation on the Julian Assange case.
*  The Parliamentary Ombudsman refused to open an investigation and refused to provide any
*  explanation.
*  This month, I discovered new information, but I'm not allowed to discuss it publicly
*  at this stage due to the ongoing litigation.
*  I want to close these remarks with an appeal to the American public and media.
*  I'm aware that you are dealing with so much right now, but this case marks a point of
*  no return for the United States and for our democratic societies.
*  I come from a country, Italy, which invented fascism.
*  A few things mark the sliding of a society into fascism than the destruction of freedom
*  of the press and the destruction of the right of the public to know what our government
*  does with our money and in our name.
*  In a notaritarian society, you cannot reveal war crimes, torture, and state criminality
*  at the highest level, as Julian Assange did, and remain free and safe.
*  They kill you.
*  In a democracy, it must be possible.
*  This is why we must win this case and free Julian Assange.
*  There are only a few months left.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Stefania Maurizi, who is also one of my big heroes, also she doesn't want to be characterized
*  as a hero, already mentioned Keir Starmer.
*  Luckily, Keir Starmer is not with us today, but we have the pure opposite of Keir Starmer
*  with us.
*  The British politician, former Labour Party leader, a great friend of ours, a member of
*  the Progressive International, and a vocal supporter of Julian Assange.
*  If he was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom today, perhaps Julian Assange would have been
*  free already.
*  But it's never too late.
*  So, it's my great pleasure to present Jeremy Corbyn today in Washington, D.C.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Sreko, and thank you, Amy, for presiding over today's event in this amazing
*  setting of a national press club where Julian Assange revealed uncomfortable truths to the
*  world about the murder, the murder of innocent civilians in Iraq by specific military orders
*  to do so, knowing full well they were breaking the law.
*  What's Julian charged with?
*  Telling the truth.
*  Telling the truth all over the world about what governments do and what governments want
*  to hide from.
*  I, as an elected politician, am very well aware that elected politicians don't like
*  being questioned on the decisions that they make.
*  But it's fundamental to a democratic society that they are constantly under surveillance
*  and under question.
*  They're very keen on putting everybody else under surveillance.
*  Their decisions should be under surveillance at the same time.
*  And so Julian published, through WikiLeaks, huge volumes of information.
*  He went to extraordinary lengths to anonymize the sources and protect the sources at the
*  same time.
*  He was extremely responsible in his journalistic approach to this.
*  And the way his character has been denigrated all over the world is a shame and a disgrace.
*  He's threatened with the Espionage Act, the Espionage Act for somebody who revealed truths.
*  And if he arrives in this country and is put on trial here, which I hope he never is and
*  hope he never does, would then face a 175 year sentence.
*  It is, in effect, a death sentence and he would be left for the rest of his life in
*  a maximum security prison in the most appalling conditions.
*  But he's already in the most appalling conditions.
*  He's being held in Her Majesty's Prison, His Majesty's Prison, Belmarsh in South East London.
*  I've visited that prison on previous occasions to visit prisoners there.
*  It is an awful place.
*  It is a brutal place.
*  It is a place devoid of humanity and he is stuck there.
*  Not a convicted criminal but a remand prisoner who is potentially awaiting trial.
*  He's the only one in that category in that particular prison.
*  Now, he is accused and WikiLeaks are accused of damaging the interests of the US government,
*  of the British government, of the French government.
*  And actually, if you plough through the tens of thousands of documents there, you'll find
*  they're pretty embarrassing to pretty well every government in the world, including as
*  a matter of fact, the government of Russia as well.
*  Because Julian wanted the truth out about what powerful nations do to people without
*  power who are victims of their exercise of that power.
*  So he also exposed the way that desperate poor migrant people face dangers in the Mediterranean,
*  the English Channel and so many other places.
*  And so our plea is here today about support for Julian.
*  But I say this to journalists who may be watching this around the world.
*  You might say, well, okay, that's Assange, that's different, that's the way.
*  Sorry, it's not.
*  It's you as a journalist.
*  Because if Julian Assange ends up in a maximum security prison in the United States for the
*  rest of his life, every other journalist around the world will think, oh, should I really
*  report this information I've been given?
*  Should I really speak out about this denial of human rights and miscarriage of justice
*  in any country around the world because the long arm of the United States espionage might
*  reach me and an extradition treaty might put me in that same prison?
*  And around the world there are, sadly, hundreds of very brave and brilliant journalists who've
*  lost their lives trying to expose the truth.
*  So today here in the National Press Club we're speaking up for journalists, real journalists
*  all over the world who want to expose the truth that we are better informed and democracy
*  functions better as a result.
*  Now as I said, I'm an elected politician.
*  And what worries me is the silence of so many fellow elected politicians around the world.
*  So my plea here today is this.
*  You have been elected by an electoral democratic process.
*  The people who elected you paced their faith and their trust in you to speak up for them
*  and their democracy.
*  Your silence makes it worse for Julian.
*  Your silence makes it worse for democracy as a whole.
*  And so when we surrounded the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Houses of Parliament
*  with a chain of people, thousands of people in support of Julian, we were demonstrating
*  our wish that our Parliament speaks up.
*  In the same way some politicians in a number of countries have spoken up.
*  But I appeal to elected politicians in the United States, speak up to defend democracy,
*  speak up against the powers of the Espionage Act and speak up for Julian Assange.
*  Because our human rights are under threat all over the world.
*  The rollback of the advances of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European
*  Declaration of Human Rights, European Convention on Human Rights and many others are under
*  threat at the present time.
*  Our actions around the world in support of Julian, in support of the right to know can
*  and I believe will change the course of what's going on.
*  So let's get a message out here today from this National Press Club in Washington.
*  We are bearing witness to a travesty of justice, to an abuse of human rights, to a denial of
*  freedom of somebody who bravely put himself on the line that we all might know that the
*  innocent died in Abu Ghraib, the innocent died in Afghanistan, the innocent are dying
*  in the Mediterranean and innocents die all over the world where unwatched, unaccountable
*  powers decide it's expedient and convenient to kill people who get in the way of whatever
*  grand scheme they've got.
*  We say no, that's why we are demanding justice for Julian Assange.
*  Hear the call, let's free Julian Assange and we will all be safer as a result of that.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Our next speaker is the American human rights attorney Stephen Donsiger who was part of
*  a team that won a historic 9.5 billion dollar judgment against Chevron Corporation for polluting
*  the Ecuador and Amazon.
*  In 2019 he was targeted in New York with the first corporate prosecution in the history
*  of the United States.
*  Overall he would serve 993 days under house arrest and in prison for a charge where the
*  maximum sentence under law was 180 days.
*  Stephen Donsiger.
*  Thank you Amy and Sherco and this wonderful panel.
*  Half the battle when you sort of deal with the attacks and I don't mean to compare in
*  any way my situation to the cruelty that Julian is enduring right now but half the battle
*  is this.
*  It's the solidarity.
*  There's so many people here when I was in this long period of detention that I never
*  could have imagined would happen in this country because maybe I was a little naive.
*  So many people came through for me and my family just like people are here today for
*  Julian and I cannot tell you how completely uplifting that was.
*  You know part of the challenge when truth tellers speak truth to these entrenched pools
*  of power is how to turn the attacks into opportunities.
*  And as I sort of watch the trajectory of Julian's case and I really haven't dug into it very
*  deeply until the last year or two by the way when I read a book by Nils Meltzer.
*  I don't know if you folks know the book.
*  Former UN special rapporteur in torture who has completely and meticulously documented
*  that the US government narrative about Julian is a complete fraud.
*  It is a complete fraud from A to Z and Nils is not someone who comes at this from a movement
*  perspective like he's a serious clinical lawyer and I would recommend by the way to all the
*  journalists out there watching this that if you have doubts about Julian and if you have
*  doubts about the case and if you've been sort of maybe a little bit taken with like well
*  I don't know about that guy that you read Nils' book because I can tell you as someone
*  who represented indigenous peoples in Ecuador for many many years against Chevron and for
*  those who don't know there's a bunch of stuff online but Chevron over a period of years
*  through Texaco deliberately dumped billions of gallons of cancer causing waste into the
*  Amazon and I went down there as a young lawyer in 1993 just like Julian started WikiLeaks.
*  You know you start thinking hey man we can do these big things and make a big difference
*  in the world and when you're a little too effective at what you do suddenly these entrenched
*  interests of power whether they be you know in the national security apparatus or the
*  fossil fuel industry they figure out ways to just forget the rule of law.
*  You know the rule of law as is normally understood to be applied and I get the fact in this country
*  we've had a lot of problems through history of not applying the rule of law not just recently
*  but as normally understood the rule of law is not being applied to Julian's case.
*  It was not applied to my case.
*  I am the first person in US history the first lawyer ever to be detained pre-trial on a
*  misdemeanor charge and my misdemeanor charge was that Chevron had figured out a way to
*  get a judge to order me to turn over my computer to their lawyers in the middle of the case
*  with all this confidential information and when I appealed that order to a higher court
*  the judge charged me with criminal contempt of court he took his charges to the federal
*  prosecutor in New York who refused to prosecute me and then the judge appointed a private
*  corporate law firm to prosecute me in the name of the US government without disclosing
*  the fact that that corporate law firm had Chevron as a client.
*  I was prosecuted in the name of the US government by a corporation and you know when I sort
*  of go through the experience and I'm so happy to be through that piece of it although I'm
*  still dealing with a lot from Chevron but I don't have my ankle bracelet and I look
*  at what Julian is dealing with all I can say is it is absolutely vital that we understand
*  the importance of Julian feeling all of our love and energy and that we continue to spread
*  the word it is critical and I will say as I look at Julian I met Julian one time by
*  the way a few years ago in the Ecuadorian embassy when he was there but there is something
*  big happening whether he realizes it or not through the process of fighting for his freedom
*  you know it is a process of consciousness raising around the world it can be seen as
*  an opportunity to strengthen our freedoms to strengthen freedom of the press as is happening
*  and I just want to point out before closing that there is an increasing corporatization
*  of these types of attacks happening in this country just this week just this week in the
*  United States we had the first police killing of a climate activist in Atlanta I don't know
*  if folks know about this cop city project and there are now 15 people by my count peaceful
*  climate activists who have been charged with domestic terrorism in the United States of
*  America we see in line three the protests in Minnesota the pipeline company pouring
*  millions of dollars into public police to arrest protesters so whether it is the national
*  security state the fossil fuel industry or other elements of the corporate class we have
*  a serious problem with our government in this country essentially being co-opted by elements
*  that could give a damn about the freedom for the rest of us and a few blocks from here
*  at the Supreme Court which by the way is meeting today to discuss whether they are going to
*  take my appeal of my misdemeanor conviction but that court if you really think about it
*  has six justices now four of whom were appointed by presidents who did not win their elections
*  they are unelected and they are making decisions about almost every critical issue related
*  to the freedom for 330 million people including what happens by the way in Julian's case ultimately
*  so we need to fight harder and I don't mean to be sort of you know leave a message of
*  that would might demoralize people because whenever I'm asked to talk about my experience
*  like the law students I'm like no no no you can really do this work this work must be
*  done and it must be done and as we see this increasing oppression we must continue to
*  organize fight spread the word and really try to turn the resistance they're giving
*  us into opportunities to advance the cause of justice so I call on President Biden to
*  step up come on this is ridiculous drop the charges and free Julie Lassange thank you
*  very much.
*  Unfortunately some people who are connected to WikiLeaks couldn't have been today with
*  us I want to remind of two names particularly who were besides Julian Assange working on
*  the leaks and analyzing all these secret documents who are still not allowed to come to the United
*  States because they would probably end up in Virginia or in a high security prison one
*  name is Sarah Harrison and the other name is Jacob Applebaum. We were supposed to have
*  Christian Hrafensen with us today but he was advised by his lawyers not to travel to the
*  United States similar to some other members of the tribunal who didn't arrive today so
*  much about the United States again. Christian Hrafensen is an Icelandic investigative journalist
*  who became unfortunately because Julian Assange is in prison the editor in chief of WikiLeaks
*  in 2018 recently together with Jose Farel he was part of a WikiLeaks delegation who
*  had a tour in Latin America and they visited five presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia,
*  Argentina and Mexico and all of those five presidents pledged that they will support
*  the fight for the freedom of Julian Assange. So I'm really happy that today unfortunately
*  not the person but Per Riddell Christian Hrafensen will speak also about that experience.
*  The story of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange has two main components, two chapters both
*  equally important. One is about the publications, the most important journalistic work of this
*  century. The other chapter is about the reaction to this work and it is equally revealing.
*  The explosive stories that emerged from the publications more than decades ago are well
*  known, war crimes, killing squads, human rights abuses in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo
*  Bay. The underbelly of US diplomacy and the diplomatic cables released in 2010 and 11.
*  The reaction site in the WikiLeaks saga is an ongoing one. It is the story of how Empire
*  is used all his might against one individual, Julian Assange, in an attempt to crush him
*  silence him, kill him. His resistance has not yet brought him any justice but it has
*  laid bare the raw elements of the Empire. The one that totally disregards the principles
*  it so proudly preaches of human rights, freedom of the press, the rule of law. The quest of
*  brutal revenge and the attempt to make an example out of Julian, the United States is
*  willing to disregard and undermine the fragile system of international order. It has blatantly
*  dismissed the United Nations findings in favor of Assange and thereby weakened two important
*  human rights bodies, one being the United Nations Tribunal on Arbitrary Detention that
*  often has successfully contributed to the release of politically persecuted dissidents.
*  The other body is United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture who found in Julian's favor. By
*  disrespecting and dismissing these UN mandates, it undermines their ability to assist other
*  politically persecuted and tortured individuals. Authoritarian regimes will simply say, why
*  should we abide by findings of these UN institutions when the US, the UK and Sweden totally disregard
*  it? Similarly, other multilateral bodies are disregarded, the European Council, the
*  European Parliament, the OAS and on we can go. So the raging pursuit of Julian Assange
*  stops at nothing, including undermining fragile international legal structures that have been
*  built up over decades with great effort in an attempt to increase order on our planet.
*  In the Assange case, the US and the UK are even violating their own bilateral treaty
*  on extradition. That treaty exempts extradition for political offenses. Despite this exemption,
*  the United States demands the extradition of Julian Assange on the basis of this treaty,
*  whilst at the same time, accuse Assange of political offenses. Not only is espionage
*  a pure form of political offense, but the indictment against him is littered with accusations
*  of political motives. It is true that Assange is guilty of attempting to put an end to war
*  crimes and corruption by exposing it. You could call that political, but if it is truly
*  a political crime, it is a crime every decent journalist should be committing. It is a journalistic
*  crime. And Julian is clearly guilty of journalism, and the evidence of it are the dozens of
*  awards he and WikiLeaks have received over the last decade. In our twisted world, it
*  has been decided by the Empire that exposing the truth is now considered a political crime.
*  The desire to make an example out of Assange and send a threatening signal to every journalist
*  in the world is so excessive that the United States is ready to put in jeopardy its press
*  freedom principles enshrined in the First Amendment. Now finally, all major mainstream
*  media in the US have seen the danger in Assange's persecution to their own position and have
*  raised concern. So have all major press freedom, free speech and civil liberties organizations
*  in the United States and indeed in the world. Still the case is ongoing. Despite this, the
*  US is still demanding extradition from the United Kingdom and Julian is still in Belmarsh
*  prison. In April, he will have spent four years there, the longest serving remand prisoner
*  in the UK in latter times. The attacks on Julian continue despite the fact that the
*  indictment against him is totally inconsistent with newly introduced press guidelines of
*  the United States Department of Justice. These guidelines are de facto part of US law since
*  November. These guidelines recognize the journalistic right to request, receive, possess and publish
*  classified government information in the public interest. At least 17 out of the 18 counts
*  in Julian's indictment are completely incompatible with these new guidelines. Mary Garland's
*  Department of Justice should be flooded with urgent demand to explain this obvious discrepancy.
*  Already the persecution of Assange has severely damaged the reputation of the United States.
*  The fact the US government is acting against its own principles, the one they preach around
*  the world has not gone unnoticed. In recent weeks, I've traveled to several Latin American
*  countries and met presidents who are very concerned about the precedent set in the Assange's
*  case. After meeting President Alberto Fernández of Argentina and his Vice President Cristina
*  de Kirchner, they both sided with the Assange's campaign urging the Biden administration to
*  drop the charges against him. Argentinians, as do others in the region, know fully well
*  the capability of the CIA in planning kidnapping or killing of individuals, as we now know
*  the agency was plotting against Julian in 2017. I met Luis Arce, the President of Bolivia
*  who fully committed himself in support of Assange. The same applied to the newly elected
*  President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, who understands better than most the nature of the lawfare
*  against Julian, having himself spent more than 500 days in prison because of such lawfare,
*  a lawfare where it is well documented that the US Department of Justice was involved.
*  President Lula assured me that the fight to end the injustice entailed in the Assange's
*  case would be a priority in his foreign policy. I got the same strong support from Gustavo
*  Pietro, President of Colombia, who called for Julian's release and the end of the persecution.
*  Lastly, I met Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of Mexico, who has been a constant
*  supporter of Julian and one who understands that this case is more than the battle for
*  the freedom of one individual, but a priority fight for underlying principles. It was Obrador
*  who said that if Julian is extradited to the United States, the Statue of Liberty should
*  be dismantled and returned to the France. The Mexican President received us in the Wikileaks
*  delegation earlier this month and assured us he would take the matter up personally
*  with President Biden. They met last week in Mexico City.
*  It is not just the political leaders of every major country south of the border of the United
*  States that now recognize the gravity of Julian's case, as Anthony Albanese, Prime Minister of
*  Australia, has recently added his voice to the demand for Julian's freedom. He said in
*  the Australian Parliament that enough is enough, and we agree.
*  All those leaders are now pointing a finger at the Empire. They are pointing out that
*  the Emperor is naked. They are drawing attention to the naked brutality in the Assange case
*  and the underlying principles that are threatened. And more world leaders will follow. Any message
*  from the United States on liberty, peace, human rights and press freedom is now measured
*  against the Assange case and dismissed as hollow and meaningless unless the Biden administration
*  drops the charges against Julian. Before the turn of the century, the US State
*  Department used the term rogue states to describe violent regimes with appalling human rights
*  records. The terminology was officially dropped at the beginning of this century, probably
*  because many of the activities of the United States in latter times have fallen under the
*  criteria of a rogue state as defined in the 90s. If there is any desire in the United
*  States to regain a position of credibility in the international arena, there needs to
*  be a multi-layered policy changes. A priority should be put on doing the right thing to
*  drop the charges against Julian Assange. And the moment to do so is now.
*  Our next speaker is Jesslyn Radock, human rights attorney renowned for her work protecting
*  whistleblowers and journalists while working at the Justice Department. And she disclosed
*  the FBI committed ethics violations and their interrogation of John Walker Lynn. Among her
*  roles, Jesslyn is the director of national security and human rights at Expose Facts.
*  I'm the one who needed the step. I'm Jesslyn Radock and I represent whistleblowers and
*  sources for a living basically. I have defended the most number of media sources in the U.S.
*  who have been investigated and charged under the Espionage Act. Defendants can't get a
*  fair trial under this law. In addition to the Espionage Act, there are other laws that
*  are not in effect. In fact, having no public interest defense, these cases are plagued
*  by secrecy and defined by Kafka-esque features. For example, I have been shut out of my own
*  clients' unclassified hearings. The parts of the hearings and trials that are public
*  include code words and substitutions that make the proceedings very difficult for the
*  public to understand. In one case, the government attempted to prevent defense attorneys from
*  using the word whistleblower or the word newspaper. The government routinely also uses classification
*  rules to withhold exculpatory evidence from defendants. In Chelsea Manning's case, the
*  government withheld a damage assessment showing that her disclosures caused no real harm to
*  national security. She was facing 35 years in prison. The government routinely used
*  the term whistleblower or the word newspaper to
*  protect her from the threat of being arrested. More recently, most recently, I represented
*  and still represent Daniel Hale. Huge shout out to Daniel. I know he's paying attention
*  to this. Basically, Daniel had to navigate an Espionage Act prosecution in the most conservative
*  federal court in the country, the exact same court in the United States. The court was
*  the same court where Assange is indicted in front of the same judge. Daniel is a veteran
*  of the U.S. Air Force who participated in the U.S. drone assassination program. After
*  leaving the Air Force, he became an outspoken opponent of the U.S.'s targeted killing program.
*  He basically called out and informed the public about targeting ineffectiveness and casualties
*  and consistently exaggerating the accuracy of drone strikes and underreporting civilian
*  deaths. Daniel's house was searched in 2014. Like Julian Assange, he lived under a sword
*  of Damocles for a better part of his adult life. In May 2019, he was finally arrested
*  and indicted on allegations that he disclosed classified documents to the U.S. military's
*  clandestine drone program, believed to have been the source material for a series in the
*  Intercept called the Drone Papers. Daniel pleaded guilty to a single count under the
*  Espionage Act and was sentenced to 45 months in prison. I think his case is a prescient
*  warning of how an Espionage Act case against Assange would proceed. Bear with me.
*  At sentencing, the judge recognized that Daniel was a whistleblower and recommended that
*  he be placed in a minimum security medical prison. But the Bureau of Prisons instead
*  sent him to an Orwellian Communications Management Unit, nicknamed the Orwellian Communications
*  Management Unit, nicknamed Gitmo North. There are only two such facilities in this country.
*  Created in the aftermath of 9-11, they were intended to house terrorists. Daniel is a
*  pacifist with no priors. Daniel was a man of the heart of the United States. Daniel
*  until recently he has been housed in this special prison with the merchant of death,
*  Victor Boot, who was recently released. So when the U.S. gives assurances that Assange
*  won't be put in a supermax, don't be fooled because he'll end up in a far worse place,
*  one of these Communications Management Units. In the CMU, Daniel is far more isolated from
*  his support network, unable to receive the medical and psychological care he so desperately
*  needs, and has more restrictions on his communications, reading materials, and visitors with other
*  people than anyone on death row. Earlier this year, Daniel applied to be transferred to
*  the type of treatment program he was recommended for at sentencing. But in the case management
*  unit where he's housed, the counterterrorism unit gets a veto over such therapeutic programs,
*  and his application was denied. They still label him a threat, meaning even if Assange
*  were to reach an acceptable plea agreement, Daniel's case proves that the U.S. government
*  can still use the prison system to retaliate the way that they are currently using process
*  as punishment while Assange is in Belmarsh. Assange is under attack for publishing information
*  in the public interest, which is threat enough to the First Amendment in and of itself. But
*  from my extensive experience fighting the injustices in cases brought under the Espionage
*  Act, it is abundantly clear that the Assange prosecution is also a threat to the public
*  and the public. And as a result of the threat to the most basic constitutional principles
*  of fairness and due process, these charges must be dropped immediately. Thank you.
*  Thanks a lot. Surprise, surprise. There are a few people in Washington, D.C. who were
*  not afraid to talk about Julian Assange all these years, and our next member of tribunal
*  is one of them. So it's my big pleasure to present the one and only Chip Gibbons, policy
*  director of the organization Defending Rights and Dissent.
*  Thank you so much for that introduction, and thank you everyone who is coming as one of
*  the few people in D.C. willing to talk about Assange's case. It gets very lonely, but I'm
*  very heartened and inspired to see all of you here today. I want to start by acknowledging
*  three people who cannot be here today. One is Julian Assange, who is imprisoned in a
*  dungeon called Bell Marsh. The second is Daniel Hale, who is currently being held in a communications
*  management unit. I've been told that Daniel watches Democracy Now, which is streaming
*  this. Daniel, if you can hear this, I want to say on behalf of everyone in this room,
*  you have our solidarity. Never let them break your spirit. A better world is possible only
*  because of people like you.
*  And as an aside, I'd like to note the CMU, much like Bell Marsh, is associated with the
*  war on terror. When governments kill civilians, not only is it not terrorism, but when you
*  expose murder by government, they treat you as the terrorist. And the third person who
*  can't be here is of course Edward Snowden, who exposed that our government was lying
*  to us about how they were spying on us and for this patriotic act was driven into exile
*  while the lying spies continue to enjoy lucrative careers with war profiteers and cable news
*  programs. And you have to ask yourself, do they view those as two different jobs? Because
*  after all, someone has to sell the wars that line their pockets.
*  I am here today to talk about Julian Assange's case. Assange's, the persecution of Assange
*  is part of a larger war on truth. Assange is a journalist and a publisher, not a whistleblower
*  or a source. But the normalization of the use of the Espionage Act against whistleblowers
*  paved the way for Assange's unprecedented indictment. My fellow witness, Jessalyn, has
*  long argued the war on whistleblowers was a backdoor war on journalism. Do you know
*  who else agrees with this? The US Army Counterintelligence Center, who in 2008 noted that the governments
*  of North Korea, Russia, and Israel, DC's favorite democracy, had blocked the WikiLeaks
*  website, but there was a better way to destroy them. Expose and prosecute the whistleblowers.
*  And they used the phrase whistleblowers in this document. They never do so publicly,
*  but they did so privately in this document to prosecute those whistleblowers to destroy
*  WikiLeaks. The US government knows, like we know, that without sources, there is no journalism.
*  But the US government is no longer content with merely going after the sources. They
*  have made Assange the first person ever indicted under the Espionage Act for the crime of publishing
*  truthful information. Make no mistake, the attempts to silence Assange is part of a larger
*  war to silence those who expose the crimes of empire, militarism, and the US national
*  security state. And it's not just a legal war involving a prosecution, but an extra-legal
*  war involving covert action and propaganda. While the US security state is cloaked in
*  secrecy, there have been a steady trickle of revelations about the three-letter agencies'
*  war on WikiLeaks. The NSA added Assange to their manhunting database. The CIA plotted
*  to kidnap and maybe even kill Assange. Various agencies sought to get around rules protecting
*  press freedom by arguing WikiLeaks were not journalists. The NSA discussed the idea of
*  declaring WikiLeaks a malicious foreign actor. The FBI and the CIA demanded a personal audience
*  with Barack Obama to persuade him that rules protecting press freedom should not apply
*  to WikiLeaks, as WikiLeaks should instead be classified as information brokers. I'm
*  not sure what an information broker is. I don't think the CIA and the FBI know either.
*  And finally, they invented the term hostile non-state intelligence agency to allow the
*  CIA to engage in offensive counterintelligence against WikiLeaks, something previously reserved
*  only for rival spy agencies and requires even less oversight, and there's very little oversight
*  over the CIA, over CIA covert action. The US government's legal and extra-legal war
*  on WikiLeaks is a war on journalism itself. By bringing an indictment under the Espionage
*  Act, the US government has endangered the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.
*  By applying the Espionage Act extraterritorially to a foreign national, they jeopardize press
*  freedom globally. It's also a war on everyone in this room's right to know. The Supreme
*  Court has long held the First Amendment also includes a right to receive information and
*  ideas. Through its lawfare, covert actions, and propaganda campaigns, the US government
*  hopes to prevent WikiLeaks from publishing. Thus, the US government has engaged in a conspiracy
*  to deprive the US people writ large of our First Amendment right to receive information
*  and ideas. They are seeking to kill the messenger in order to prevent all of us from getting
*  the message. And I know my time is up, but I have my own message. I'm sure there's someone
*  from the J. Edgar Hoover building, which is just a few blocks down the street, sitting
*  in the audience somewhere. So I want you to write this down and take this to your bosses.
*  We will free Julian. We will free Daniel. We will bring Edward home. And you can put
*  in my FBI file that I said that. Thank you very much.
*  Kevin Gastela is our next speaker, journalist, author, who's worked extensively on US violations
*  of civil liberties, in particular on the cases of John Kiriakou, Chelsea Manning, and Julian
*  Assange. He's managing editor of Shadowproof, a press organization which exposes systemic
*  abuses of power in government and business. Thank you. It's an honor to be here and be
*  part of this really esteemed group of delegates. And also, this is a far better event than
*  the Hayden Center event that was held back in December with some very unserious people,
*  including a brief appearance by Michael We Still Secrets Hayden. The political case against
*  Julian Assange is primarily composed of a conspiracy theory that comes from the Central
*  Intelligence Agency. In April 2017, as we've been hearing in the first speech from CIA
*  Director Mike Pompeo, he not only labeled WikiLeaks a non-state hostile intelligence
*  service, but he also asserted WikiLeaks directed Chelsea Manning in her theft of specific secret
*  information. Part of my book, Guilty of Journalism, the Political Case Against Julian Assange,
*  focuses on unraveling this conspiracy theory. Manning was not directed by WikiLeaks to make
*  submissions. She tried to share documents with the New York Times and the Washington
*  Post. She maintains WikiLeaks was a last resort because the prestige media in the U.S.
*  failed her. Thanks to the work of Yahoo News reporters, we now know that the label Pompeo
*  affixed to WikiLeaks stemmed from CIA policy. The CIA did not want to brief Congress or
*  have President Donald Trump looped into their plans to target WikiLeaks with a disruption
*  campaign. They treated WikiLeaks as a rival spy service, as you just heard from Chip, to
*  mount offensive counterintelligence operations, free of any oversight. Actions undertaken
*  included the targeting of WikiLeaks' digital infrastructure. Agents had a green light to
*  provoke, quote, internal disputes within the organization by planting damaging information.
*  They could steal the electronic devices of WikiLeaks' staff. The CIA also allegedly sketched
*  out plans to kidnap or poison Assange. Much of the pressure campaign to force Assange
*  out of the Ecuador embassy was carried out by a Spanish security company called UC Global.
*  Its director David Morales has been accused of crimes in a Spanish court, and this arrangement,
*  formal or informal, gave the CIA the ability to deny involvement, which is typical. Just
*  recall how the CIA developed arrangements with right-wing and often violent Cuban exile
*  groups. UC Global planted microphones in the embassy. They targeted Stella Assange, their
*  baby and Assange's attorneys. There were audio and video feeds that kept them under constant
*  surveillance, and as Margaret Kuntzler said, people who came to visit the embassy had to
*  hand over their electronics, which were then copied by people at these checkpoints. Dossiers
*  were compiled on visitors. When former CIA Director Leon Panetta was asked by a German
*  public broadcaster about the CIA-backed operation, he let out a belly laugh. That doesn't surprise
*  me. That kind of thing goes on all the time. And in the intelligence business, the name
*  of the game is to get information any way you can, and I'm sure that's what was involved
*  here. For what it's worth, the U.S. Justice Department did not indict Assange after Manning
*  was convicted in a U.S. military court martial. CIA discussions about putting Assange on a
*  rendition flight stirred panic among senior officials in both the Trump administration
*  and Justice Department. As the Yahoo News report indicated, there were no charges under
*  seal, and if Assange was abducted, as the CIA did with Khaled al-Masri and Abu Omar,
*  there would be no legal basis to triumph in the United States. Justice Department officials
*  accelerated the drafting of charges against Assange, and by December 2017, within the
*  first year of Trump's presidency, the DOJ had a sealed indictment. The CIA's actions
*  were motivated by revenge, and they still are. WikiLeaks exposed their arsenal of cyber
*  warfare capabilities through files published in March 2017. It was embarrassing for the
*  CIA, and by April, they were hell-bent on neutralizing Assange one way or another. Going
*  back to Pompeo's April 2017 speech, he said, we have had administrations before that have
*  been squeamish about going after these folks under some concept of this right to publish.
*  Pompeo proclaimed that Assange had no First Amendment freedom because he is not a U.S.
*  citizen. The gloves were off. We barely know the extent of the CIA's operations against
*  Assange and WikiLeaks, despite a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York brought
*  on behalf of attorneys and journalists allegedly targeted. The U.S. Justice Department's prosecution,
*  along with the CIA's influence over the judiciary, ensures that the full truth of their actions
*  may not be known for several years or even multiple decades. But what can be stated confidently,
*  largely as a result of the CIA, Assange languishes in detention, punished by a draconian process
*  that takes a greater toll on him every day and leaves other dissident journalists, particularly
*  foreign journalists, fearing that they may be next if they follow Assange's example
*  and challenge the U.S. national security state. Thank you.
*  I encourage you all to check out Kevin's brilliant new book, Guilty of Journalism.
*  I don't know whether it's still here yet, but there is another incredible book by Stefania
*  Maurizio which you can buy after the event and she will be signing the books. So this
*  is just an intermezzo. Before I present our next member of tribunal, and just to say we
*  have, I think, five more members of tribunal speaking and a little surprise at the very
*  end, before presenting our next speaker I want to be a bit personal. Namely, I became
*  father recently. Thanks a lot. And at the same time, my father, my own father, was in
*  prison in Yugoslavia when I was born. So with these two experiences I can only start imagining
*  what the family of Julian Assange is going through. His wife, his children, his mother,
*  his father and his brother. So the next speaker, I met the next speaker and the next member
*  of tribunal who is unfortunate to not be in person with us today, I met Julian Assange
*  in prison in, I think it was November 2019. It was the first time I met John Shipton,
*  Julian's father, and I must tell you that this man who went through hell, similar like
*  his mother, was much more calm than me when he was visiting, when we were visiting the
*  prison. He was the one who was calming me down, he was the one who was telling me how
*  everything functions in that very dark place. So I'm very honored to be presenting John
*  Shipton to you today. Please take a look at his testimony.
*  Hello everyone. John Shipton here, Julian's father. Unbelievably, we now enter the 14th
*  year of the persecution of journalist and publisher Julian Assange. What's most striking
*  is the ceaseless malicious abuse, the hounding, the constant hounding of Julian, the spears,
*  the unscrupulous calamities, lies that have characterized this 14 years, the interminable
*  court cases, the abuse of process, the malicious application of bureaucratic regulations, the
*  ceaseless application of the power of three states, Swedish, United Kingdom, and the
*  United States, despite their constant adulation of themselves.
*  Despite their constant crying from the rooftops about their free press, about how the right
*  to free speech is an artifact which they bring to the world. Despite all that, they continue
*  the persecution of journalist and publisher Julian Assange.
*  This forces us to contemplate the magnificent gift the English speaking people gave to the
*  world, the civilizational gift of due process between the two states.
*  Between the state and the citizen, due process came about 800 years ago from the Magna Carta
*  at Browning Mead, placing between the people and the state a shield of laws through which
*  the state must relate to the people. This is the gift of due process.
*  Great artifact has been abandoned, ruined in the case of Julian Assange, and it has now
*  become the persecution of Julian, has now become a global problem which the United Kingdom
*  and its judiciary and its Crown Prosecuting Service and its colonial and foreign office
*  ignore to the detriment of their reputations and their relationships with other states
*  in the world. That where once they could say that we, the United Kingdom, are governed
*  by laws from which we call the common law, which goes upon precedent. Well, these precedents
*  they call the authorities in court cases, these authorities, they crushed, they discarded
*  in their haste to hound a man, Julian Assange, who only ever spoke truthfully, who only ever
*  published accurately some form of malicious resentment of a state, the United Kingdom,
*  another state, the United States, that had committed war crimes, that had committed war
*  crimes upon war crimes, human rights abuses, human rights crimes, crimes against humanity.
*  Crime against humanity is in simply a crime against us, our mothers, our fathers, our
*  children. And pointing out this allows these states to reform, but in their pride and hubris
*  they have decided not to use the democratic process to reform themselves, but use the
*  democratic process to deceive people and hound, to kill people, to kill people, to kill people,
*  close to death's door in dire circumstance, publisher and journalist Julian Assange.
*  So I believe that the work of the volunteers, the supporters, over the last four or five
*  years have brought to an end, to an end point, to such embarrassment for the United Kingdom,
*  the Crown Prosecuting Service and the English judiciary, to a point of embarrassment where
*  other states that once looked to the mother of parliaments, the United Kingdom, once looked
*  as example to the United Kingdom and its parliament and its laws, now turn their face away in
*  worry and in contempt for this announcing to the world that as they have done in the
*  United Kingdom and their parliament, that they are the leaders in free speech, among
*  the leaders in free speech, among the leaders in the rights to publish, among the leaders
*  in advocating for journalism, among the leaders in advocating that having an educated populace
*  produces policy influences from the populace that guide the executive and the parliament.
*  That is no longer the case. All of us turn away and look to other states or other circumstances
*  wherein we agitate wholeheartedly, firmly in solidarity for Julian Assange as an icon
*  of decay and as an of the application of laws, an icon of persecution, an icon of righteous
*  statements, of accurate statements and of steady hand despite us being now in the 14th
*  year of this prosecution, persecution, torment, interminable hounding, scurrilous lies, colonies,
*  mobbing. There is a book by Professor Nils Melzer which outlines the history of the
*  constitutions in detail in quite readable language in English, French, German, all of
*  the abrogation of human rights, abrogation of conventions of asylum, abrogation of due
*  process and the collapse of equitable administration of the law into a decadent, unparalleled
*  circumstance of malice, of bureaucratic malice, judicial indifference, due process ignorance.
*  We Julian's supporters, Julian's family, are beginning to prevail, are beginning to
*  prevail, are beginning to see around the world in every European Parliament support for Julian
*  Assange, every civil society of standing giving support, all unions giving support. In Australia
*  we have a government which is elected on a platform which we characterise as an Assange
*  platform, an Assange election, a government elected principally in our view, principally
*  in our view, principally on its stand for Julian Assange. I say this to indicate the
*  level of support worldwide in the Western world, in Middle East, in India, in Eurasia
*  for Julian Assange. Together we have done this and together we will prevail in bringing
*  about Julian's freedom. Thank you.
*  Julian's father. And now to Betty Metzger. As a reporter for the Washington Post in 1971,
*  she was one of the only journalists willing to cover leaked documents exposing FBI crimes
*  including surveillance of students, of academics, of anti-war and civil rights activists. One
*  of the stolen files revealed the existence of one of the FBI's illegal programs, Co-Intelpro,
*  the counter intelligence program under J. Edgar Hoover. She's the former chair of the
*  Department of Journalism at San Francisco State University and the author of The Burglary,
*  the discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's secret FBI. Betty Metzger.
*  I'm honored and humbled to be part of this panel that seeks justice for Julian Assange
*  sorely needed. I'm here with a case study, something that I think shows very clearly
*  the great importance of protecting whistleblowers and the necessity of a free press. And it
*  is the story of the people, the impact of the people who burglarized an FBI office in
*  1971 and then stole every file in the office and made them public. I've worked with them
*  twice when I didn't know them and they sent files to me back in 1971 and then when I worked
*  on the book when they revealed their identity even though the FBI had at that time the largest
*  search that they had ever had and didn't find the burglars. They came out in 2014.
*  These eight people were outside whistleblowers. They were average citizens, though they did
*  extraordinary things. In fact, they called themselves a Citizens Commission to investigate
*  the FBI. They had decided that because Congress and the executive branch had never carried
*  out responsibility to oversee the FBI, they would exert oversight as citizens in order
*  to get documentary evidence of whether the government was suppressing dissent. And they
*  made the decision to do this after thinking very seriously about it. Three of them had
*  very young children and they realized that if arrested and convicted, they could serve
*  many years in prison. But they thought it was so important to uncover what this hidden
*  all-powerful agency was doing that they decided to break into an office. They used tools quite
*  different from what the tools of today's whistleblowers. Instead of multiple thumb
*  drives or vast spaces on the internet, their tools were a crowbar, a car jack, large suitcases,
*  flashlights, and getaway cars, and eventually copiers. But their motivation was the same
*  as the motivation of other whistleblowers. Get important information to the public about
*  injustices being done secretly by the government. They found what they were looking for, evidence
*  of massive suppression of dissent. But they also found, and I should say, that they were
*  doing it 52 years ago, and nobody prior to that was writing about anything about intelligence
*  agencies. It was assumed both by the government, by Congress, the people who should have had
*  oversight, and by journalists that they had an obligation to let those agencies keep their
*  information. They were not allowed to do that. They were not allowed to do that. They were
*  not allowed to keep their secrets. There was no accountability. In the files that these
*  people released, was it one thing was a shocking policy, enhance the paranoia, get the point
*  across, there's an agent behind every mailbox. They also found campus employees were hired
*  as FBI informers to inform on students and faculty. And every black student on at least
*  one campus in the Philadelphia area was under FBI surveillance. They also found that Hoover
*  operated a massive Stasi-like program throughout the country against black Americans. Every
*  agent in the country was forced to participate and had to hire an informer to create files
*  on black people. To be black in Hoover's mind was to be dangerous and therefore subject
*  to surveillance by the FBI. They also discovered that Hoover maintained a security index, an
*  ever-expanding list of people believed by Hoover to be subversive and who were to be
*  secretly detained by the FBI during a national emergency. Calls for congressional investigation
*  of Hoover and FBI died less than two months after the burglary. Congress had no appetite
*  for this. But thanks to NBC reporter Carl Stern, a congressional investigation later
*  became imperative. Without Carl's determined effort to find out who was behind the burglary
*  and how, what COINTELPRO was, those Bureau operations regarded eventually as the worst
*  might never have been revealed. Carl would like to have been here with us today and I
*  wish he could have been, but he has a very serious case of COVID. As a result of his
*  successful lawsuit in December 1973, journalists were now armed with the stated purpose of
*  COINTELPRO to secretly expose, disrupt, and neutralize political movements. And they began
*  requesting COINTELPRO files and they started pouring out. The public now learned for the
*  first time that the FBI conducted lawless operations that ranged from crude to cruel
*  to life threatening and murder. Prostitutes known to have venereal disease were hired
*  to infect campus activists. FBI informers were coached to give false testimony against
*  innocent people, people known to be innocent to the person testifying, testimony that led
*  to convictions and decades in prison for the falsely accused, most of them black people.
*  A plot was designed to cause Martin Luther King to commit suicide and murder. An FBI
*  informer provided the Chicago police with the crucial information that made it possible
*  for police to shoot Fred Hampton dead as he slept. In January 1975, thanks to all this
*  information that came out, both the House and the Senate opened investigations of FBI
*  and all intelligence agencies. It was the first time Congress had done such a thing.
*  At hearings, high FBI officials testified under oath that Bureau officials had never
*  considered the legality or ethics of COINTELPRO or any other operations. These hearings and
*  the reforms the senators successfully recommended would not have happened without whistleblowers
*  who risked their freedom and a free press that reported their important revelations
*  and ultimately a Congress that finally was willing to act, including establishing permanent
*  intelligence oversight committees and strengthening the Freedom of Information Act. All of these
*  reforms, as probably everybody in the room knows, have been battered and bruised at various
*  times since then, but they exist and they are still valuable. It was Joe Biden's Congress
*  that put in place the reforms that flowed from the media burglary. The Biden administration
*  surely knows from the very important revelations made by whistleblowers in the past that this
*  source of crucial information must not only not be threatened, but must be protected.
*  To continue the prosecution of Mr. Assange under the Espionage Act of 1917 could not
*  only continue Mr. Assange's imprisonment for decades, it also could, in violation of the
*  Constitution, gut the First Amendment rights of journalists. A radical result that surely
*  neither President Biden nor Attorney General Garland wants to have as their legacy.
*  Thanks a lot to our member of the Tribunal, Betty. I think it was a very important testimony
*  because it shows that there is a continuous persecution and oppression of dissent in this
*  country and that those who are courageous enough to protest the measures of this government
*  end up criminalized, end up in prison, end up in character assassination and so on.
*  So the next speaker at this Tribunal, and we have three more left, thanks a lot for
*  the patience of all of you, is one of the most famous whistleblowers not in US history
*  but in global history and it's my great honor to present him today, Daniel Ellsberg.
*  Hi, I'm Daniel Ellsberg. One of the foundation stones of our former government here in the
*  United States, a democracy and a republic, is our First Amendment to the Constitution
*  which forbids any law by Congress or the states abridging freedom of speech or of the press
*  along with freedom of religion and of assembly. That has precluded the passage of a British
*  type Official Secrets Act which most countries have, almost no other country has a law singling
*  out the press as protected by our freedom by the First Amendment. And the British type
*  Official Secrets Act which criminalizes any or all disclosure of information protected
*  by the government, the executive branch, even disclosure to the public or to the press or
*  to the Congress, the parliament, is criminalized and subject to prison. We've never had such
*  an act because of our First Amendment. In fact, one was almost inadvertently passed
*  by Congress in the year 2000 but it was vetoed by President Clinton as a clear-cut violation
*  of the First Amendment. He cited in his opinion, accompanying some of the opinions in the Pentagon
*  papers case of half a century ago. That had resulted from my disclosure of information
*  that I had authorized possession of as a contractor to the government at that time, 7,000 pages
*  of top secret documents about the history of US decision making in Vietnam which disclosed
*  a repeated sequence by four different presidents of lies and in effect violations of the Constitution
*  treaties and in particular misleading Congresses the costs for war. I was, I was, I was, I
*  was facing 115 years in prison but not for an Official Secrets Act which we don't have.
*  It was an experiment by President Nixon to use our Espionage Act which had always been
*  directed and intended for use against spies giving information secretly to a foreign government
*  especially in time of war. Had never been used as it was by Nixon in my case as and
*  substitute for an Official Secrets Act for disclosure to the public with no derogation
*  of my intentions there but simply that holding, doing that was a violation. That was dismissed
*  on grounds of government criminality against me and there never has been a Supreme Court
*  decision on whether the use of the Espionage Act as is now facing Julian Assange as a basis
*  for an attempt to extradite him from Britain to the US was constitutional. They've never
*  received it even though there have been dozens of cases since then, since my case in which
*  the Act was used as if it were an Official Secrets Act. In effect making it a reliable
*  substitute in withholding from the public any information the government doesn't want
*  it to have which is an enormous amount of information. Up until Julian Assange's indictment
*  the Act however had never been used as an Official Secrets Act is against other sources
*  like myself who had possession of information who disclosed it to the public. It had never
*  been used against a journalist like Julian Assange although in each case of course of
*  such disclosures or leaks some form of media was involved, many many people involved in
*  that but they had never been indicted for that before. Actually if you're going to use
*  the Act against the journalist in blatant violation of the First Amendment's denial
*  of Congress's ability to criminalize acts by journalists, by the press, the First Amendment
*  is essentially gone. As I say we're almost the first to have it. We fought a war of independence
*  and established a constitution so we have a First Amendment Britain that's not where
*  Julian now is and they have an Official Secrets Act which we don't. If we acquire that we
*  give up the main result I would say of that war of independence in the sense that we are
*  no longer really a republic or a democrat. We have monarchical powers, imperial powers
*  formally and every empire requires secrecy to cloak its acts of violence that maintain
*  as an empire. It's a major form in our change in our form of government. The fact is that
*  the Espionage Act is even broader than the British Official Secrets Act and that's why
*  Congress, any people in Congress who wanted to uphold secrecy have given up trying to
*  pass a formal Official Secrets Act. They prefer the Espionage Act because the wording of that
*  Act so far not used even against a journalist until Julian Assange and not used beyond a
*  journalist to someone who simply receives the information or possesses it, maintains
*  it without giving it to an authorized authority. That is covered by the language of the Espionage
*  Act. To challenge that, a year ago I released a top secret document on the Taiwan Straits
*  Crisis of 1958, that long ago, in which the US came close to using nuclear weapons to
*  uphold the protection of Taiwan from mainland China, an issue which is now very much facing
*  us this year. And I challenge that as someone who had held that and refused to give it to
*  authorized authority for all these years in order to raise in court for the first time
*  whether one can take the plain language of the Espionage Act as controlling, as overruling
*  basically the First Amendment. To go further this year in connection with the attempt to
*  extradite Julian Assange, I also reveal the fact that I had been as subject to indictment
*  as Julian all this time since 2010 because I had possessed the information which he released
*  to the newspapers before he did that. He conveyed it to me before he did that as a backup to
*  what he was doing for the press. In the plain language of the Act then, as someone who possessed
*  that information and did not disclose it to an authorized person who retained it, I like
*  actually every reader of the Times, the New York Times, The Guardian, El País, Le Monde,
*  who received and published that information, every reader all over the world comes under
*  the plain language of that Act. I'm in effect saying with Julian, I am prepared to face
*  a test of that Act going up to the Supreme Court if necessary and restoring our status
*  as a republic. I call on President Biden either to indict me along with Julian Assange
*  and others or to drop this unconstitutional attempt to extradite Julian. I wouldn't have
*  to be extradited or to prosecute either of us in these courts. That is really the only
*  way for him to restore our status as a republic and a democracy.
*  Thank you, Dan Ellsberg. Before we turn to Noam Chomsky, attorney Suchitra Vijayan is
*  formally worked for the United Nations War Crimes Tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
*  She is founder now of the Polis Project, a New York-based research and journalism organization
*  supporting civil resistance around the world. Thank you and what an honor to share the stage
*  with people that you've grown up respecting, your idols. I'm not going to take more time
*  than I'm going to keep it very short. I'm going to start with something that Julian
*  Assange very famously said. You have to start with the truth. Truth is the only way we can
*  get anywhere. Without truth, there is no reality. There is no way for us to challenge the power.
*  And almost everybody who spoke here today spoke about this idea of truth because there
*  are two things that are human to us. Truth, the capacity to understand what is before
*  us and our capacity to tell stories and pass it on.
*  Truth is also our right to know. Without it, there is no way for us to fight for the values
*  we hold here. Freedom, dignity and the moral equality of all people. The persecution of
*  Julian Assange is not just about First Amendment. It's not just about the freedom of press.
*  It goes to the heart of the crisis of citizenship, the rapid erosion of civil liberties in the
*  hand of deeply authoritarian democracies in the West. We need to name the beast. We have
*  to start calling Western liberal democracies what they are. They are deeply authoritarian,
*  totalitarian, with deep lines of fascist ideologies that get implemented not today but for many,
*  many years. Criminalizing dissent, persecuting dissidents, political trials, imprisoning
*  journalists in high security prisons and treating them as terrorists are not new. These are
*  part of the long established strategies of state terror. Throughout history, the U.S.
*  government has incarcerated its political opponents. Black activists, students, labor organizations,
*  writers, intellectuals, antiwar activists, protesters, the list is long. Today, the U.S.
*  considers its most dangerous enemies those who challenge its abuse of power and expose
*  its crimes both at home and abroad. Assange is a political prisoner. He's a dissident
*  of the West. His crime, exposing brutal acts of violence, abuse of power, and about the
*  crimes against innocent civilians. For this, every legality, deception, and malice has
*  been deployed against him. Systematic violations of due process, judicial bias, manipulated
*  evidence, constant surveillance, defamation, lies, propaganda, denial of basic dignity,
*  assassination attempts, and threats. Just let that sink in. And I'm happy to read it
*  one more time if you want. I know what I'll read it one more time. Systematic violations
*  of due process, judicial bias, manufactured evidence, manipulated evidence, constant surveillance,
*  defamation, lies, propaganda, denial of basic dignity, assassination attempts, and threats.
*  But why is Assange a threat? I came of age in the age of after the aftermath of 9-11.
*  In the past 20 years, we witnessed a proliferation of militarized borders, camps, and castrile
*  citizenships. As a young lawyer, I worked providing legal aid for Iraqi refugees in
*  Cairo. During this time, we served over 800 families. Hundreds of legal summaries that
*  I wrote were not just about asylum petitions or resettlement requests. These were also
*  biographies of a destruction of a nation and its people. Imperial violence unleashed on
*  them. Torture, death, mutilation, rapes, disappearances. In 2010, WikiLeaks posted classified U.S.
*  military videos depicting the killing of dozens of unarmed Iraqis, including two Reuters journalists.
*  The release confirmed what many of us had already known. The war in Afghanistan was
*  no different. Orwell wrote, the frightening thing about totalitarianism is not that it
*  commits atrocities, but that it attacks the concept of objective truth. It claims to control
*  the past as well as the future. I also happen to teach. And when I teach young people today,
*  they do not know what happened after 9-11. They do not know what happened in Afghanistan,
*  and they do not know what happened in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon. They don't know because we
*  have forgotten to teach them. And that is why truth is important. That is why stories
*  are important. Journalists are the most important people, not because they are great, because
*  they create the footnotes of history. Lies start war, and silence enable impunity. Assam's
*  persecution is a result of publishing truth about atrocities committed against innocent
*  civilians in the name of freedom. Fundamental to upholding the moral equality of all people
*  is our capacity to hold the state and the powerful accountable. Yet, unfortunately,
*  the ability to systematically hold power accountable is being eroded every single moment. And it's
*  being stripped away even as I speak. Today I stand with my fellow members of the tribunal
*  demanding the release of Julian Assange. As we fight for his release, we fight for journalists,
*  activists, truth tellers, and stand in unconditional solidarity with those fighting for freedom
*  and dignity across the world. Thank you.
*  Last but not least, we have a very short message by one of the most important living public
*  intellectuals of the United States, Noam Chomsky.
*  Our message for today is quite simple. Free Julian Assange. Assange has been indicted
*  under the Espionage Act. It's another shameful chapter in its sordid history from its origins.
*  Should be stricken from the books, the act has no place in a free and democratic society.
*  We should perhaps not be surprised that the act is now being used to punish the people
*  who punish the exercise of journalism, letting citizens know what is being done in their
*  name. It's an unforgivable assault against the majesty of the state. The crime of the
*  indictment under this disgraceful legislation is compounded by the years of imprisonment
*  and torture that Julian Assange has already suffered. The targets of the indictment, however,
*  reach far beyond their immediate victim. They reach, in fact, to all of us who hope
*  to understand what is happening in the world and to the journalism profession who's taking
*  the responsibility to perform this essential service in a democratic order. Those who seek
*  to perform this honorable task are under harsh attack in these horrible days. That's more
*  reason to assure the attack on journalism will not be joined by the most powerful state
*  in human history. In short, free Julian Assange without further unconscionable delay.
*  I have never heard Noam Chomsky be so concise. And as we begin to wrap up, I'll be even shorter.
*  The ballroom here at the National Press Club is packed. Over 5,000 people are watching
*  online. You can get the link of this whole event at democracynow.org. Spread it far
*  and wide. Go to where the silence is and say something.
*  Don't worry, it won't be a long speech. I just want to thank all the members of the
*  tribunal today. Thanks a lot for being with us today. I also want to thank especially
*  Amy and Dennis behind the camera and the team of Democracy Now. I also want to thank all
*  our partners. The list is very long, so I won't name all of them, but I want to especially
*  thank the Wow Holland Foundation. I also want to thank the National Press Club for hosting
*  us, and I want to thank all our volunteers for making this possible.
*  So what are our next steps? Today we provided convincing testimonies and convincing evidence
*  on the case of Julian Assange, and now it's up to the Biden administration to drop the
*  charges. But it's also up to all of you here in the room and outside of the room to take
*  this further and to make pressure as much as possible towards the Biden administration.
*  We at the Progressive International, together with our partners, in March are coming to
*  Sydney with another Belmarch tribunal, so watch out. And I want to close this tribunal
*  with the words of someone who is silent. I want to close this tribunal with the words
*  of the man himself, Julian Assange, because I think it's a beautiful description of this
*  tribunal of everyone who is here with us today.
*  Quote, if we can live only once, then let it be a daring adventure that draws on all
*  our powers. Let it be with similar types whose hearts and heads we may be proud of. These
*  people here, these people here in the room, let our grandchildren delight to find the
*  start of our stories in their ears, but the endings all around in their wandering eyes.
*  Julian Assange. And now, for the very end, a little surprise by our common friend Roger
*  Waters, a song which was specially recorded for Julian Assange on this occasion. Thanks
*  a lot everyone for being with us today. Free Julian Assange, and Julian Assange will be
*  free this year.
*  So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell, and blue skies from pain
*  Can you tell a green field From a cold steel wave
*  A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell
*  Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts
*  Hot ashes for trees And hot air for a cool breeze
*  Cold comfort for change And did you exchange
*  A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage
*  How we used to be How we used to be
*  How we used to be How I wish you were here
*  We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fishbowl
*  Year after year Running over the same old ground
*  What have we found The same old fear
*  That I wish that you were here Oh, I wish you were here
*  How I wish, how I wish you were here Running over the same old ground
*  What have we found The same old fear
*  That I wish that you were here
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Ooh, ooh, ooh
*  Applause
*  I wish you were here, brother.
*  Thank you.
