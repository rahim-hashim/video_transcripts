# Frozen Embryos Are Children? Reproductive Care in Peril in Alabama
**Democracy Now!:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCyBdIL9o6g)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.
*  Welcome to our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
*  Alabama's largest hospital has paused in vitro fertilization treatments as it works
*  to assess the impact of a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that said frozen embryos should
*  be considered children.
*  In a statement, the University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System said, quote,
*  We are saddened that this will impact our patients' attempt to have a baby through IVF,
*  but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted
*  criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments.
*  The ruling stems from appeals cases brought by three couples whose frozen embryos at a
*  reproductive clinic in Mobile, Alabama, were accidentally destroyed when a hospital patient
*  dropped them on the floor.
*  In a 7-2 decision, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled the couples can now sue the clinic for
*  wrongful death.
*  The ruling partly hinged on anti-abortion language added to the Alabama Constitution
*  in 2018 that says the state recognizes the, quote, rights of the unborn child, unquote.
*  In his opinion, Alabama Chief Justice Tom Parker cited biblical verse a number of times,
*  writing, quote,
*  The ruling has sent shockwaves to the world of reproductive medicine as legal experts
*  and infertility specialists take measure of the potential effects on access to IVF and
*  other fertility treatments.
*  Furthermore, we're joined by Barbara Calura, the president and chief executive of Resolve,
*  the National Infertility Association, which represents the interests of infertility patients.
*  She's joining us from Scottsdale, Arizona.
*  And joining us from Atlanta, Georgia, is Angela Granger.
*  She underwent IVF treatment in Alabama in 2020, delivered her baby in 2021.
*  Before the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, she'd considered returning to Alabama for future
*  IVF rounds to get pregnant again.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
*  Barbara Calura, let's begin with you.
*  Can you respond to this ruling and what it means for people all over the country?
*  It's a shocking ruling.
*  It is something that is going to terrify people all over the country that this might happen
*  in their state, certainly in Alabama.
*  But honestly, we have been predicting that something like this might happen, hoping it
*  never would.
*  But we are getting closer and closer to this.
*  Certainly with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, we saw many more states try and attempt to
*  declare a fertilized egg a person.
*  And now here we have it.
*  It's devastating news for people who are, quite honestly, trying to have children and
*  build their family.
*  Angela Granger, could you also respond to the ruling and talk about your own experience
*  with IVF treatment in Alabama?
*  Yeah, honestly, it was just very shocking.
*  It was like it just took the wind out of me.
*  I did IVF in Alabama at a fertility clinic in Birmingham, and I went there specifically
*  who is amazing and highly, highly looked upon as like one of the best in Alabama.
*  And I would have loved to go back to her, but it just seems that that is just kind of
*  a scary decision right now, and it's not something that I trust.
*  I just don't trust what's going on to be able to go back at this point.
*  Now, the largest Alabama hospital has now suspended IVF treatment.
*  Was that the place where you got your treatment, Angela?
*  No, it wasn't.
*  I went to Alabama, sorry, Alabama fertility specialist, but it is everybody is like they're
*  not kind of responding to anything right now, you know, so it just seems that even all my
*  friends that have frozen embryos and whatnot, their clinics are like, hey, this is a day-by-day
*  thing and we will let you know when we have a statement.
*  And it just seems that there's a lot of question and a lot of confusion right now.
*  Barbara, could you explain exactly how IVF treatments work and how this ruling will impact
*  all those seeking that treatment in Alabama?
*  Sure.
*  The goal of IVF is a healthy baby, and they do that by stimulating the woman's ovaries.
*  They do a surgical procedure where they retrieve eggs.
*  Those eggs are put in a petri dish in a laboratory.
*  They then are fertilized with sperm.
*  The laboratory personnel watch that petri dish over the next few days.
*  After three days, they assess the embryos.
*  After five days, they assess those embryos.
*  If the embryos at day five look to be viable, they will transfer one embryo to the woman.
*  We don't know if that is going to implant or not.
*  A lot of people think that doctors can implant embryos.
*  They cannot.
*  They are simply transferred to the uterus.
*  What happens to those other embryos that were in the petri dish?
*  They are cryopreserved or frozen.
*  That is a standard procedure.
*  Embryos have been known to be cryopreserved and result in live births after 20 years of
*  being frozen.
*  This is modern science but the state of the art care.
*  Those frozen embryos are future attempts for that person to try at pregnancy.
*  Those embryos are thawed one at a time and then they are transferred again to the woman.
*  If we are talking about a frozen embryo as a person or as a child, can we actually even
*  freeze them?
*  That is a question that we have.
*  We don't even know if some of the other procedures that are typically part of the
*  IVF process will be able to be done given that the status of an embryo is now a child
*  in the state of Alabama.
*  And isn't it true that it is much less effective for a person to freeze their eggs than to
*  freeze a fertilized egg?
*  Well, it can be done.
*  It is far more cumbersome, it is not as effective as you said, and it is going to cost more.
*  If we retrieve those eggs from the woman and we freeze the eggs, so there is no petri dish,
*  no fertilization, and then we thaw one egg at a time and try and fertilize that, wait
*  those five days, see what happened, and then start over.
*  It seems incredibly cumbersome.
*  I can't even imagine what it will look like in the laboratory to do IVF this way, and
*  it is certainly going to cost more and it is going to put women through more.
*  Keep in mind for every one of these transfers, and I am sure that your guest who is on can
*  tell you this, you are put on medication, sometimes it is injectables, sometimes it
*  is a pill, and you are preparing your body for that embryo.
*  You want a pregnancy.
*  You want the highest chance of pregnancy.
*  So if you are trying to do this over the course of every one of those frozen eggs being thawed
*  and fertilized, I can't even imagine what that is going to put people through.
*  Well, I would like to go to a response to the ruling from U.N. Ambassador and Republican
*  presidential Hopeful, who was speaking on an interview with NBC News on Wednesday and
*  was asked about the ruling.
*  Embryos to me are babies.
*  Even those created through IVF.
*  I had artificial insemination.
*  That is how I had my son.
*  When you look at, one thing is to have to save sperm or to save eggs, but when you talk
*  about an embryo, you are talking about to me, that is a life.
*  I do see where that is coming from when they talk about that.
*  That was Nikki Haley, Republican presidential Hopeful, speaking on NBC News Wednesday night.
*  Barbara, your response to what she said.
*  Well, we completely disagree with the Alabama Supreme Court ruling.
*  It flies in the face of science.
*  IVF has been practiced in the United States since 1981.
*  A microscopic group of cells, we can't even see an embryo.
*  You need a microscope to see it.
*  We do not look at that as a person, as a child or as a baby.
*  It has the potential for life.
*  Just like in natural conception, not every embryo results in a live birth.
*  That's just not how our bodies work.
*  That's not how biology works.
*  To equate that a frozen embryo, microscopic, is a baby, we don't agree with that.
*  The science does not agree with that either.
*  I want to turn to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responding to a question
*  about the ruling Tuesday.
*  This is exactly the type of chaos that we expected when the Supreme Court overturned
*  Roe v. Wade and paved the way for politicians to dictate some of the most personal decisions
*  families can make.
*  All across the country, women are being forced to grapple with the devastating consequences
*  of action by Republican elected officials from undermining access to reproductive care
*  and emergency care to threatening access to contraception.
*  And as a reminder, this is the same state whose attorney general threatened to prosecute
*  people who help women travel out of state to seek the care they need.
*  So the president, this president and this vice president will continue to fight to protect
*  access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore the protections of
*  Roe v. Wade in federal law for all women in every state.
*  So that's Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House Press Secretary.
*  Barbara Kalora, if you can respond to her and also talk about how this affects the LGBTQ
*  plus community.
*  Well, when when the overturning of Roe v. Wade happened in 2022, we were extremely concerned
*  about how it might impact our community.
*  Remember, these are people who are trying to build their family.
*  And we have been fighting for many, many years, attempts at the state level to declare a fertilized
*  ag person.
*  So this is not new for us.
*  This is something that we have seen over and over and over again.
*  However, those attempts have failed.
*  Defining a fertilized ag person has has not taken hold.
*  We call it embryo personhood.
*  And yet we were extremely concerned that now the floodgates, if you will, would be opened
*  after the DAPS decision.
*  So this is something that I hate to say we predicted and we thought might happen.
*  I also just want to mention that for for for people who are going through infertility or
*  people who are going through IVF process, their embryos are incredibly precious to them.
*  This is the potential of life.
*  This is the potential of their child.
*  And and we treat that extremely seriously.
*  So I don't want to discount how people feel about their embryos and how attached they
*  are. There's an emotional attachment.
*  Yet we all know who do this, that that is not a living human being.
*  It has the potential for life.
*  Your question about the LGBTQ community.
*  So if you are in a same sex relationship and you want to be a parent, you have options,
*  whether that be through adoption or through medical assistance.
*  And and so impacting the community.
*  Well, if you're a same sex male couple, you're going to need to do IVF and have a surrogate.
*  If you're a same sex female couple, you could try IVF.
*  You might do artificial insemination.
*  There are a number of possible ways.
*  But certainly the IVF process impacts a lot of people, including those with cancer.
*  You can freeze your sperm and egg and embryos before you go through a cancer treatment or
*  other medically induced procedure that can impact your fertility.
*  So please understand this impacts a very wide group of individuals.
*  Barbara, could you explain, do you see this as part of a broader attack to restrict reproductive
*  rights? And also, are you concerned that other states might follow suit?
*  Well, I'm going to start with your second question.
*  We absolutely are concerned that other states are going to follow suit.
*  We have seen states get right up to the edge of this and try for this.
*  I now believe that they're going to look at this as a precedent.
*  They're going to look at their own statutes and make sure that they're airtight, that
*  embryos are included in these potential wrongful death statutes.
*  And I'm absolutely convinced we're going to see legislative attempts to define what a
*  fertilized egg is. This is about defining when life begins.
*  To answer your first question, this is kind of the Holy Grail.
*  We talk about pregnancy, we talk about an embryo in the womb, but we have embryos outside
*  of the uterus. And what is their status?
*  This has been what the anti-choice movement has been wanting to do and to define very,
*  very clearly that this is life, that this is a living human being.
*  And we just know that this is going to dramatically impact the care for people who want to have
*  children and who need this medical treatment to be a parent.
*  I wanted to go back to Justice J. Mitchell's majority opinion, quoting the Bible repeatedly,
*  saying, quote, We believe each human being from the moment of conception is made in the
*  image of God created by him to reflect his likeness.
*  It's as if the people of Alabama took what was spoken of the prophet Jeremiah and applied
*  it to every unborn person in this state.
*  Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
*  Before you were born, I sanctified you.
*  Jeremiah 1, 5.
*  I want to put this question to Angela Granger.
*  You're a single mom. You went to Alabama.
*  Do you think you would have your son today if this ruling took effect before you did
*  your IVF?
*  And talk about single moms by choice, non-traditional families that are becoming traditional families,
*  because there are so many, whether we're talking about single moms, single parents,
*  the LGBTQ community.
*  What this is doing to families in America?
*  Yeah, I—excuse me.
*  I strongly believe my son would not be here.
*  I would not have gone to Alabama had this ruling happened, and I would have had to find
*  another way.
*  Like many in my community dealing with IVF, I'm a single mom by choice, meaning I used
*  donor sperm in order to conceive my son.
*  But I also dealt with infertility, so I kind of had a foot in both communities.
*  And the reality is, is there's so much trauma we go through before getting to IVF that deals
*  with loss and grief and surgeries and all kinds of things.
*  And so for them to now tell us that what we have been working so hard towards—sorry—is
*  something that now we might be negligent or be charged for murder or something is—it
*  is so offensive, and it just adds more trauma to the trauma we're already going through
*  needing to do IVF.
*  Being a single mom by choice, one vial of 1 milliliter of sperm can cost upwards now
*  with shipping over $2,000.
*  So when we go to do IVF, we want to freeze embryos for siblings.
*  That is the whole point.
*  If we are lucky enough to have enough embryos to freeze, because those that deal with infertility
*  are begging God for one or two embryos that come out of maybe even 30 eggs that are retrieved.
*  So what is so baffling to me is that the people that are making these laws and forcing them on
*  us are people that don't understand what we've been through, what infertility means,
*  what being a single mom by choice means or part of the LGBTQ.
*  We have no other choice, and now you're taking that choice away from us.
*  AMY GOODMAN
*  Angela Granger, we want to thank you so much for being with us.
*  She underwent IVF treatment in Alabama in 2020, delivered her baby boy in 2021.
*  Barbara Kalora is president of Resolve.
