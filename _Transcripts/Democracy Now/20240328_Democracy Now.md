*  I'm Amy Goodman.

*  Anraha.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  I don't know what to say.
*  I can't make sense of what happened.
*  My parents, my father, with his displaced friends, who came from Gaza near the industrial
*  area and were staying with him, they were all together when suddenly they were all gone
*  like dust.
*  They fled from one death and came to another.
*  If the Security Council issues another resolution, they will hit more.
*  For God's sake, do not pass more resolutions.

*  Every time they pass a resolution, they hit us more.
*  We're all dying.
*  My parents last night.
*  We will be tomorrow.
*  Others will follow.
*  We're all on the way to death.

*  Meanwhile, local media is reporting Palestinian journalist Mohammed Abu Sahir was shot and
*  killed at Al-Shifa Hospital.
*  In related news, the Palestine Red Crescent says Israel recently released seven of its
*  members who were detained on the raid on Al Amal Hospital in February.
*  The health workers, who included the director of ambulance and emergency services in Gaza,
*  spent 47 days in prison.
*  Eight other Red Crescent staffers are still being held.
*  This comes, as UNRWA said, 171 of its workers have now been killed in Gaza.
*  The death toll there since October 7th has now topped 32,500, including 14,000 children.
*  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least four Palestinians Wednesday.
*  Three of them were killed in an overnight air raid.
*  I started screaming, and my nephew was with me.
*  I was calling for an ambulance or a car and calling on the people to come and help us
*  to move bodies from the ground.
*  People came to help because the ambulance was late, because the checkpoint was closed.
*  We carried Hamza, and he was still breathing.
*  But when we reached the ambulance, he died.
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 450 Palestinians have been killed in the West
*  Bank since October 7th.

*  administration's support for Israel.
*  Anel Shielin was a foreign affairs officer in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and
*  Labor who focused on promoting human rights in the Middle East and North Africa.
*  In a piece for CNN, she writes, quote, whatever credibility the United States had as an advocate
*  for human rights has almost entirely vanished since the war began.
*  Anel Shielin will be joining us later in the broadcast.
*  The president of the Center for American Progress, Patrick Gaspard, who is also a longtime Democratic
*  insider and former U.S. ambassador to South Africa, blasted the Biden administration's
*  defense of Israel's actions in Gaza.
*  Gaspard's comments came after State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters
*  this week the U.S. believes Israel is complying with international law.
*  Gaspard said Miller's statement is, quote,
*  a gross disregard of overwhelming evidence and a dangerous precedent in the conduct of
*  U.S. foreign policy.
*  Meanwhile, the White House says it's working with Israel to reschedule a date for a D.C.
*  visit by an Israeli delegation to discuss the planned invasion of Ra'a.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously canceled the meeting after the U.S. refused
*  to veto a U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolution.
*  Elsewhere, Ireland says it'll intervene in South Africa's genocide case against
*  Israel at the International Court of Justice.

*  a, quote, blatant violation of international humanitarian law on a mass scale.
*  In Jordan, police continue to crack down on thousands of protesters who've been demonstrating
*  near the Israeli embassy in Amman for three days.
*  Protesters could be heard chanting, betrayal, as they call on Jordan to cancel its deals
*  with Israel.
*  Our message has been a message of the Jordanian popular movement since the beginning of October
*  7th and before that.
*  We are asking the Jordanian government to cancel the Wadi Araba peace treaty with Israel
*  and all its annexes that we believe harm Jordanian national interests.
*  This requires us to stand with the choices of the Palestinian people, who are facing
*  an aggression by the Zionist entity, the American administration and the European West.
*  In Baltimore, rescue workers recovered the bodies of two victims of the Francis Scott
*  Key Bridge collapse.
*  The men were identified as 35-year-old Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, originally from Mexico,

*  Another four workers are still missing and presumed dead in the river.
*  All six victims were immigrant overnight construction workers.
*  The National Transportation Safety Board said the investigation into the cargo ship's
*  collision with the bridge could take one to two years to complete.
*  President Biden has vowed to direct federal funds to pay for the entire cost of the bridge's
*  reconstruction.
*  In Alabama, a Democrat has flipped a seat in the state legislature after running on
*  abortion rights and preserving access to IVF, in vitro fertilization, in what Democrats
*  hope is a bellwether ahead of November.
*  Marilyn Land said of her victory, quote,
*  "'Alabama women and families sent a clear message that will be heard in Montgomery
*  and across the nation.
*  Our legislature must repeal Alabama's No Exceptions abortion ban, fully restore access
*  to IVF and protect the right to contraception,' she said."
*  Voting rights advocates in Pennsylvania are expressing alarm after a federal appeals court
*  ruled undated mail-in ballots should not be counted even if they arrive on time.
*  The ACLU said this could result in thousands of Pennsylvania voters losing their votes.
*  The Republican National Committee praised the ruling.
*  Meanwhile, in Montana, the state Supreme Court has struck down four Republican laws aimed
*  at restricting the vote, including one which would have largely ended same-day voter registration.
*  The three white men who chased down and killed Ahmaud Arbery in 2020 asked a federal appeals
*  to toss out their hate crimes convictions.
*  The three convicted murderers say prosecutors did not prove they targeted Arbery, who they
*  shot and killed while he was out for a jog because he was black.
*  During the trial of William Bryan and father and son Greg and Travis McMichael, prosecutors
*  shared dozens of racist text messages and social media posts from the men in the months
*  and years before the murder of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery.
*  Ahmaud's father Marcus Arbery responded to the news Wednesday.
*  Donald Trump lashed out at New York judge Juan Marchand and the judge's daughter just
*  hours after the judge imposed a gag order on Trump ahead of his criminal hush money
*  trial next month.
*  On his Truth Social platform, Trump called Judge Marchand a hater and accused him of
*  being biased and conflicted.
*  In response to the partial gag order, Trump claimed Marchand was, quote,
*  wrongfully attempting to deprive me of my First Amendment right to speak out against
*  the weaponization of law enforcement, unquote.
*  The gag order does not technically shield Marchand from public statements by Trump.
*  Former Connecticut senator and vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman has died at the age
*  of 82 after a fall.
*  Lieberman was a leading backer of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
*  He also helped kill the public option in the Affordable Care Act and fought efforts to
*  expand Medicare eligibility.
*  In 2000, he became the first Jewish vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket when he ran
*  as Al Gore's running mate.
*  In 2008, he endorsed Republican Senator John McCain for president over Barack Obama in
*  his memoir.
*  McCain said he was sorry he didn't choose Lieberman as his vice presidential running
*  mate over Sarah Palin.
*  The Phoenix City Council has approved a new ordinance to protect many workers from extreme
*  heat.

*  and air conditioning.
*  Meanwhile, in Florida, the Republican-led state legislature recently passed a bill barring
*  municipalities in Florida from adopting any local measures to protect workers from extreme
*  heat.
*  In Argentina, a court has convicted 11 former officials of crimes against humanity for committing
*  atrocities against over 600 people during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina
*  from 1976 to 1983.
*  The victims included transgender women, high school students, prisoners who gave birth
*  in captivity and whose babies were taken from them.
*  The court ruled the former military, police and government officials were involved in
*  torture, rape and murder at secret torture centers on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
*  On Sunday, thousands of Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires to remember the victims of
*  the military dictatorship.
*  Today, some families here in Argentina are still searching for their children.
*  The idea is that every March 24th we should remember that date so we don't repeat those
*  mistakes.
*  People that have a memory do not repeat those mistakes.
*  This all comes as Argentina's new far-right president Javier Mele faces renewed criticism
*  for downplaying dictatorship-era atrocities.
*  In Indonesia, 13 soldiers have been arrested after video emerged showing them torturing
*  a man at a military outpost in West Papua.
*  The Indonesian military also issued a rare apology for the incident, according to Amnesty
*  International.
*  The man who was tortured later died.

*  Around 80 people remain hospitalized after surviving the worst terror attack in Moscow
*  in decades.
*  The arrest of four Tajik nationals has sparked an increase in attacks on Central Asian migrants
*  in Moscow and other cities.
*  The Embassy of Tajikistan in Russia has warned its citizens to stay home if possible.
