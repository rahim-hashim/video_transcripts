# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 18, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Ru_WEr1m8)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The Israeli military has conducted another major raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
*  There are reports Israeli snipers are firing at people inside the hospital, which has also
*  been attacked by tanks and drones.
*  According to Palestinian health officials, about 30,000 people have been sheltering at
*  the hospital.
*  Israel said the raid was being conducted to target Hamas militants.
*  At least 80 Palestinians have been detained at the hospital, including Al Jazeera correspondent
*  Ismael Algul.
*  This comes as the U.N. aid agency UNRWA is reporting one in three children under the
*  age of two in northern Gaza are now actually malnourished, as Israel continues to block
*  aid from entering Gaza.
*  UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said, quote, the speed at which this catastrophic
*  child malnutrition crisis in Gaza has unfolded is shocking, especially when desperately needed
*  assistance has been at the ready just a few miles away, she said.
*  On Friday, a ship carrying 200 tons of aid arrived in Gaza from Cyprus, but aid groups
*  say far more aid is desperately needed.
*  Palestinian mothers say they've nothing to feed their children.
*  What has this child done to suffer from hunger?
*  I cannot find milk for five shekels or a packet of milk from the agency.
*  There, the normal milk is for 150.
*  There's no work.
*  There's no food.
*  No drinks.
*  We are eating plants.
*  We started eating pigeon food, donkey food.
*  We are like animals.
*  Despite growing international criticism, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing
*  to move ahead with plans to attack the city of Raffa, where over 1.4 million Palestinians
*  are seeking refuge.
*  On Sunday, he also criticized U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's call for
*  new elections in Israel.
*  Netanyahu spoke on CNN.
*  I think what he said is totally inappropriate.
*  It's inappropriate to go to a sister democracy and try to replace the elected leadership
*  there.
*  That's something that Israel, the Israeli public, does on its own.
*  We're not a banana republic.
*  Talks are continuing in Qatar over a possible temporary ceasefire in Gaza.
*  Over the weekend, Hamas offered a new three-phase ceasefire plan that includes the initial release
*  of the remaining five female hostages and 35 men who are old, sick or injured in exchange
*  for 700 to 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
*  Hamas said it would only release Israeli soldiers held captive after a permanent ceasefire
*  is reached.
*  On Sunday, the Irish Tasia, Leo Veradker and his partner Matthew Barrett joined President
*  Biden during a St. Patrick's Day celebration at the White House.
*  The Irish prime minister called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*  The Irish people are deeply troubled about the catastrophe that's unfolding before
*  our eyes in Gaza.
*  And when I travel the world, leaders often ask me why the Irish have such empathy for
*  the Palestinian people.
*  And the answer is simple.
*  We see our history in their eyes.
*  A story of displacement, of dispossession, a national identity questioned and denied,
*  forced emigration, discrimination and now hunger.
*  So we support your work and that of your administration to secure a humanitarian ceasefire and to
*  create the space for lasting peace.
*  The people of Gaza desperately need food, medicine and shelter.
*  And most especially, they need the bombs to stop.
*  This has to stop on both sides.
*  The hostages brought home and humanitarian relief allowed in.
*  Meanwhile, protests continued around the world over the weekend, including in Dublin, Ireland,
*  where protesters called out the prime minister for joining President Biden at the White House.
*  In San Sebastián, Spain, demonstrators rallied before laying down on the ground next to
*  a massive banner depicting part of Paca's famous anti-war painting Guernica.
*  It's so tough to be a witness to a genocide that we can do nothing about.
*  We can just bring a grain of sand, even as a tribute.
*  Other large protests were held in Chile, Norway, Australia, Jordan and across the United States.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the West against sending troops to Ukraine,
*  saying it could lead to World War III.
*  Putin made the remarks earlier today after he won an unprecedented fifth term in office.
*  Russian election officials say Putin won 87 percent of the vote in this weekend's election,
*  where opposition anti-war candidates were barred from running.
*  Putin spoke at a victory rally Sunday.
*  No matter who wants to frighten us, no matter how they want to suppress us, our will, consciousness,
*  as I have already said, no one has ever succeeded in anything like this in history.
*  It has not worked now and will not work in the future.
*  Never.
*  The election came just weeks after Putin's most prominent critic, Alexei Navalny, died
*  in an Arctic prison.
*  Navalny's wife, Yulia, urged supporters to gather outside polling stations Sunday at
*  noon to protest Putin.
*  Yulia Navalny spoke after voting at the Russian embassy in Berlin.
*  You're probably wondering what I wrote on the ballot papers, who I voted for.
*  Of course I wrote Navalny's surname, because it just can't be so that a month before
*  the election and already during the presidential campaign, Putin's main opponent, already
*  imprisoned, was murdered.
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian election, which was also held
*  in parts of occupied Ukraine.
*  There is not a single bit of legitimacy in the simulation of an election, and there cannot
*  be.
*  This actor should be on trial in The Hague.
*  That's what we have to ensure together with everyone in the world that values life and
*  decency.
*  Zelenskyy's comment on Sunday came two days after a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian
*  city of Odessa killed at least 21 people and injured 73.
*  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump campaigned in Ohio over the weekend and warned
*  there would be a bloodbath in the United States if he lost the election to Joe Biden.
*  Now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole—that's
*  going to be the least of it.
*  It's going to be a bloodbath for the country.
*  That'll be the least of it.
*  During the same speech, Trump escalated his dehumanizing attacks on migrants.
*  If you call them people—I don't know if you call them people.
*  In some cases, they're not people, in my opinion, but I'm not allowed to say that
*  because the radical left says that's a terrible thing to say.
*  They say you have to vote against him because did you hear what he said about humanity?
*  I've seen the humanity, and these humanity—these are bad, these are animals, OK?
*  Trump also called for the jailing of lawmakers who took part in the House Select Committee
*  investigating the January 6th insurrection.
*  In related news, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence has said he, quote, cannot in good
*  conscience endorse Trump's reelection bid.
*  In other Trump news, Nathan Wade has resigned as special prosecutor in the Georgia election
*  interference case against the former president.
*  The issue is Wade's undisclosed romantic relationship with Fulton County District Attorney
*  Fannie Willis.
*  On Friday, a judge ruled Willis could remain on the case if Wade resigned.
*  Meanwhile, in New York, the judge overseeing Trump's hush money trial has agreed to delay
*  the start of the trial until mid-April.
*  Dozens of U.S. citizens left Haiti on a chartered flight Sunday amidst an escalating political
*  and humanitarian crisis.
*  The flight left from an airport in Capacien because Haiti's main airport in Port-au-Prince
*  remains shut down.
*  About 1.4 million Haitians are on the verge of famine as street violence has disrupted
*  efforts by aid groups to distribute food.
*  Some aid containers have also been seized by armed groups.
*  Last week, Haiti's unelected Prime Minister Aréen Henry agreed to resign once a seven-person
*  transitional council was formed, but the makeup of the council has not yet been announced.
*  The military junta in Niger has ordered U.S. troops to leave Niger in a major setback to
*  U.S. military operations in Africa.
*  Six years ago, the U.S. built a $110 million drone base in northern Niger.
*  The U.S. currently has about 1,000 troops in the West African nation.
*  The announcement comes months after France was forced to pull its troops from Niger as
*  well.
*  Colonel Ahmedou Abdramani spoke on Saturday.
*  On cooperation between the two countries, in particular military cooperation in the
*  fight against terrorists, the U.S. presence on the territory of the Republic of Niger
*  is illegal and violates all the constitutional and democratic rules, which would require
*  the sovereign people, in particular through its elected representatives, to be consulted
*  on the installation of a foreign army on its territory.
*  In Senegal, opposition leaders Ousmane Sanco and Bassidou Diomé-Fey have been released
*  from prison ahead of next Sunday's rescheduled presidential election.
*  The release comes after outgoing President Macky Sall granted the men amnesty.
*  Sall had sought to postpone the elections until after his term ends in April, but was
*  forced to backtrack following massive protests, and after a court rule, the move was unlawful.
*  Bassidou Diomé-Fey is one of 19 candidates who will appear on the ballot.
*  He's backed by the popular opposition figure Ousmane Sanco, who himself is barred from
*  running.
*  President Sall has named former Prime Minister Ahmedou Ba as his pick to succeed him.
*  As the humanitarian crisis worsens in Sudan, U.N. officials are urging the Sudanese military
*  and rival rapid support forces to immediately allow aid deliveries to save nearly 5 million
*  people from catastrophic hunger in the coming months.
*  Nearly 18 million people are already facing acute food insecurity after nearly a year
*  of war.
*  Fighting has devastated agricultural production, disrupted trades block most access to humanitarian
*  aid.
*  UNICEF warns hundreds of thousands of Sudanese children suffering from severe malnutrition.
*  The numbers of acutely malnourished children are rising, and the lean season hasn't even
*  begun.
*  Nearly 3.7 million children are projected to be acutely malnourished this year in Sudan,
*  including 730,000 who need lifesaving treatment.
*  The needs for children in Khartoum alone are massive.
*  But this is also true in Darfur, where I was last month on a cross-border mission through
*  Chad.
*  The scale and magnitude of needs for children across the country are simply staggering.
*  Sudan is now the world's largest displacement crisis, and some of the most vulnerable children
*  are in the hardest to reach places.
*  That was Jill Lawler, chief of field operations and emergency for UNICEF in Sudan.
*  The UN General Assembly is considering a draft for its first-ever resolution on artificial
*  intelligence.
*  The measure was spearheaded by the U.S., which says it aims to make A.I. safe, secure and
*  trustworthy and easily accessible to all.
*  While presenting the draft resolution last week, a reporter asked U.S. Ambassador to
*  Thomas Greenfield if the U.S. approves of Israel using A.I. in its assault on Gaza.
*  The Israeli military has confirmed they are using artificial intelligence in targeting
*  in their war in Gaza.
*  Do you condemn that, and will that be taken into your account in this A.I. resolution?
*  We have been clear that this resolution is about making A.I. safe and secure and trustworthy.
*  And we have 60 co-sponsors who have signed on to that, including Israel.
*  And I think that as we move forward, we will see A.I. bridge many of the gaps that we've
*  seen in the past.
*  Are you fine with Israel using it in Gaza right now?
*  That's not for me to comment on.
*  This comes as the European Union approved last week its own first-ever Artificial Intelligence
*  Act.
*  The US groups warned the legislation, they say, sets a dangerous precedent.
*  The group Access Now said, quote,
*  Here in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams and the Legal Aid Society have reached a deal
*  which preserves New York's right to shelter policy for unhoused people but cap shelter
*  stays by 30 or 60 days for newly arrived migrant adults.
*  The settlement also bars New York City from forcing people to sleep on chairs and floors
*  of so-called waiting rooms where adult migrants wait in hopes of securing a shelter placement.
*  Housing and immigrant justice groups welcomed the protection of the right to shelter policy
*  and said they will continue working towards making it applicable for all New Yorkers.
*  The NYUCLU, the New York Civil Liberties Union, said, quote,
*  And a federal court temporarily paused new government rules that require public companies
*  to disclose more information about their greenhouse gas emissions and the financial risks they
*  face from the climate crisis.
*  The case was brought by a pair of fracking companies.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
