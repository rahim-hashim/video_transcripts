Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made headlines this week after suggesting the 2024 election could be the last U.S. election if he wins in November. We look at a secret organization of wealthy Christians called Ziklag that is backing Trump's efforts by working to purge more than a million voters from the rolls in battleground states and mobilize Republican voters to back Trump. The news outlets ProPublica and Documented obtained thousands of Ziklag's internal files and found the group has divided its 2024 activities into three different operations: Steeplechase, which uses churches to get out the vote; Watchtower, which aims to rally voters around opposition to transgender rights; and Checkmate, which is focused on funding so-called election integrity groups, explains ProPublica investigative reporter Andy Kroll.

# Ziklag Exposed Secretive Christian Nationalist Network Tries to Purge Voters in Battleground States
**Democracy Now:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIh6X_sXAr4)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, War, Peace and the Presidency.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made headlines this week after suggesting
*  that this year's election could be the last U.S. election if he wins in November.
*  Trump made the comment Friday in Florida at Turning Point Action's Believers' Summit.
*  Christians, get out and vote!
*  Just this time!
*  You won't have to do it anymore.
*  Four more years, you know what?
*  It'll be fixed.
*  It'll be fine.
*  You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.
*  I love you, Christians.
*  I'm a Christian.
*  I love you.
*  Get out.
*  You gotta get out and vote.
*  In four years, you don't have to vote again.
*  We'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote.
*  For more on who's backing Trump's efforts, we look at a secret organization of wealthy
*  Christians who are working to purge more than a million voters from the rolls in battleground
*  states and mobilize Republican voters to back Trump.
*  It's called Ziklag.
*  The news outlet's ProPublica and Documented obtained thousands of Ziklag's internal
*  files and found the group has divided its 2024 activities into three different operations.
*  Steeplechase, which uses churches to get out the vote, and Watchtower, which aims to rally
*  voters around opposition to transgender rights.
*  The third operation, called Checkmate, focused on funding so-called election integrity groups
*  as laid out in this Ziklag member strategy video.
*  Voter irregularities are rampant across all 50 states, but especially pronounced in the
*  battleground states.
*  Public polling confirms Americans have lost confidence in electoral integrity.
*  With the federal election already in full swing, more must be done to ensure fair elections
*  in the most important republic in the world.
*  That's the purpose behind Operation Checkmate and its practical approaches to both get out
*  the vote and clean electoral rolls through our coalition partners.
*  Through these efforts, we have the opportunity to play a significant role in the upcoming
*  election.
*  ProPublica reports Ziklag's mission is to take dominion over seven spheres of public
*  life, which it calls mountains, business, science and technology, family, arts and media,
*  church education and government.
*  For more, we continue with Andy Kroll, investigative reporter for ProPublica, his recent piece
*  inside Ziklag, the secret organization of wealthy Christians trying to sway the election
*  and change the country.
*  Andy, lay it out for us.
*  Andy Kroll Ziklag is a secretive network of ultra-wealthy
*  Christians, conservative Christians, who have this two-part goal, two-part vision for this
*  One is to get heavily involved in the 2024 elections in the ways that you just described,
*  mobilizing pastors, knocking people off the voting rolls, demonizing trans people to motivate
*  conservative voters.
*  But then looking toward the 20 and 30-year horizon, Ziklag's goal is nothing less than
*  moving the country toward a state of Christian nationalism, having biblical worldviews, quote-unquote
*  biblical truth, shaping, influencing every part of American culture, those seven mountains
*  that you described.
*  So this really is, as one expert we quoted in the story told us, a vision for Christian
*  supremacy.
*  Ziklag, the name, refers to a biblical reference about David taking refuge during his struggle
*  with King Saul.
*  The analogy here, of course, is that the Christians in this group apparently feel that
*  they are under siege and that this group is their refuge, but then the place from which
*  they plan their campaign, their assault to take back American culture.
*  In a Ziklag member briefing video that you obtained at ProPublica, one of Ziklag's
*  spiritual advisors, Lance Wallnau, a Christian evangelist and influencer, laid out a plan
*  to deliver swing states by using an anti-transgender message to motivate conservative voters who
*  are exhausted with Trump.
*  If we can get the left to own their position on LGBTQ, the country's already drifted
*  on the homosexual issue.
*  But on transgenderism, there's a problem, and they know it.
*  They're going to want to talk about Trump, Trump, Trump, he's indicted, the guy's
*  a criminal, this and that, they're going to have riots on the street and all the Kabuki
*  theater.
*  Meanwhile, if we talk about—it's not about Trump.
*  It's about the parents and their children.
*  And the state is a threat.
*  When you get Governor Newsom or Governor Whitmer or Paulist, your top three potential candidates
*  for the future presidency of the United States, other than Kamala, you got these—when they're
*  going to have to stand with, they're LGBTQ donors.
*  And so when they solidify that position, that's where they've gone too far.
*  So that's Lance Wallnau, a Christian evangelist and influencer.
*  Andy Kroll, if you can talk about him, what he's saying and who the other leaders of
*  this are.
*  Lance Wallnau is maybe one of the most important Christian evangelist figures that maybe your
*  audience hasn't heard of.
*  He was one of the earliest Christian right leaders to endorse Donald Trump.
*  We're talking way back in 2015 here.
*  He popularized this notion that Donald Trump was a modern-day Cyrus, a sort of flawed but
*  virtuous leader who would deliver a victory for Christians.
*  And that Cyrus idea really caught on, was a big reason that evangelicals turned out
*  to such a big degree for Trump in 16, again in 20.
*  Wallnau remains this bridge between the Christian right, Christian nationalism and Trump world.
*  Wallnau is one of a number of really influential and well-known people that are part of Ziklag.
*  Some members that your audience might have heard of, the Green family, they're the
*  family behind Hobby Lobby.
*  Obviously, they've had a pretty big impact in trying to strike down parts of the Obamacare
*  law back in the Obama presidency.
*  The Uline family have donated to this effort.
*  They are, of course, the billionaire office supply family out of the Midwest, major, major
*  political donors to Republicans and to Donald Trump.
*  And then another family is the Waller family, influential in Ziklag.
*  They are the owners of the Jockey Apparel Company, which probably a lot of people have
*  heard of, even if they haven't heard of this family.
*  So you have a number of really wealthy, really influential, conservative Christian families
*  in this group.
*  They have the means to invest not just in political work, but also in this larger cultural
*  transformation plan that Ziklag has really organized itself around.
*  Andy, talk about more in depth these three programs, Checkmate, Steeplechase and Watchtower.
*  Yeah, you see an almost sort of wrap-around, 360-degree approach to influencing the 2024
*  election in these three groups.
*  So with Steeplechase, you have mobilizing conservative pastors out in America, out
*  in the field, to mobilize their congregations to get them out to vote.
*  And there's some concern that maybe there's fatigue about Donald Trump in 2024, that maybe
*  conservative Christians won't turn out in the numbers they did in 2016.
*  That's what this program is there for, getting the churches involved as possible.
*  You have this anti-trans operation, as Lance Wallnau says in that video that you just played.
*  They believe that going after trans people, demonizing transgender Americans, transgender
*  healthcare can, quote-unquote, deliver swing states.
*  That's what Lance Wallnau himself said.
*  But then this final one I think is honestly perhaps the most interesting, this Operation
*  Checkmate, putting money into mobilizing conservative voters in key counties, not just states, but
*  the counties.
*  So Maricopa County in Arizona, Fulton County in Georgia, the other battleground counties
*  in the country.
*  And then trying to put money into knocking more than a million voters off the voting
*  rolls in these states.
*  And you see this in a couple of ways, but what's so interesting is how the Christian
*  right, Christian nationalism, is fusing here with the election integrity or really the
*  election denial movement that grew out of the 2020 election.
*  We didn't have a lot of evidence of that before this reporting on sick lag.
*  But you see this bridge again between the Christian right and the election deniers in
*  a really big way going into this election.
*  And how effective can they be in knocking voters off the rolls?
*  A little bit of money goes a long way when you are trying to get people knocked off the
*  eligibility list for voters.
*  That's what the experts, the political consultants, the folks that know these worlds, told us
*  in the reporting for this story.
*  You know, sick lag is putting, say, $800,000 or a million dollars into something called
*  Eagle AI, an artificial intelligence software that makes it easier to challenge the eligibility
*  of voters en masse.
*  So you're not doing it one by one.
*  You're doing it by the hundreds, by the thousands.
*  You don't need tens of millions of dollars, the experts told us, to be able to make those
*  challenges and to sort of turbocharge the effort to make voters ineligible.
*  You only need a few hundred thousand dollars, maybe a million dollars.
*  That's what this group, sick lag, appears to be doing.
*  So it could have an effect.
*  And we're talking about margins again in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, margins
*  that are a few thousand, a few tens of thousands of voters.
*  And Andy, how does the election officials in every state, especially in the battleground
*  states, their cooperation with these efforts, how might that turn out in the coming election?
*  Well, you have two different camps here.
*  You have the election officials in these states and in these counties who are just trying
*  to run a free and fair election.
*  What we've heard from those officials is that these efforts like Eagle AI or the work
*  of the group True the Vote, another quote unquote election integrity group, these mass
*  challenges to the voter rolls make an already difficult job, an already stressful job, a
*  time consuming job even more difficult.
*  It's putting just more stress on the work of these local election officials, the ones
*  who are trying to do a good job.
*  And then you have the officials who have sort of bought into the election integrity claims,
*  who have bought into Donald Trump's election denial for 2020 or 2022 even.
*  And for them, they are in some places encouraging these mass challenges.
*  And so you might see confusion, you might see chaos, you might see voters unaware that
*  they've been removed from the rolls in these kinds of places.
*  So it's just creating either more stress on good officials or it's creating more chaos
*  with officials who buy into these baseless claims about election fraud.
