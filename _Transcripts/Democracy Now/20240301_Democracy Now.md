**Democracy Now!:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRj_1jrK4ao)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  In Gaza, the official death toll has topped 30,200, as Israeli forces continue their deadly
*  attacks one day after Israeli soldiers fired on people waiting for aid in northern Gaza,
*  killing at least 104 people.
*  Harrowing survivor accounts have emerged in the wake of the massacre.
*  We went to get food and flour, and they started shooting at us.
*  Then we threw ourselves into the streets, and no one looked for us.
*  Eventually, people brought us here.
*  There are martyrs lying around, and no one is looking for them.
*  If aid is to come to us in this way, we do not want it.
*  We do not want to live on the blood of our children.
*  If our children will die and be harmed in exchange for aid, we do not want aid.
*  Gaza's Health Ministry announced today at least another four children have died of starvation
*  and dehydration in northern Gaza.
*  On Capitol Hill, California Congressmember Ro Khanna grilled Defense Secretary Lloyd
*  Austin over ongoing use support for Israel in light of Thursday's massacre of Gazans
*  waiting for food aid.
*  If Israel again ever stops American-paid aid from getting into Gaza, will you commit
*  to not sending future arms sales?
*  Again, that's not my decision.
*  We need some consequences.
*  When another country is defying you, defying the national security adviser, defying the
*  president, defying National Security Memorandum 20, there has to be some consequence.
*  Secretary Austin refused to say the U.S. would ever hold Israel accountable for killing
*  Palestinians and violating international law.
*  During questioning, Austin also said over 25,000 Palestinian women and children have
*  been killed by Israel since October 7th.
*  Though that figure is likely close to the true death toll, the Pentagon was later forced
*  to walk back Austin's statement, claiming he was referring to the total death toll,
*  not just women and children.
*  In Labor News, Washington state's largest union, United Food and Commercial Workers,
*  endorsed a primary vote for uncommitted rather than President Biden in the March 12th primary,
*  citing a need to quote, end U.S. funding toward this reckless war, unquote.
*  Yemen's Houthi movement warned it's planning surprise military operations in the Red Sea
*  against Israeli, U.S. and other targets over the assault on Gaza.
*  Meanwhile, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Makati, said a ceasefire in Gaza would
*  trigger negotiations to halt fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces.
*  We are saying, God willing, if we are able to reach a cessation of military activities
*  in Gaza, then I believe that we will have ahead of us weeks packed with negotiations
*  so that we can reach what I have always called long-term stability in the south of Lebanon.
*  In New Jersey, residents of Tinek say they'll organize public protests if the Keter-Tora
*  synagogue goes ahead with a plan to host a March 10th real estate event selling housing
*  units and illegal West Bank settlements.
*  This is local activist Rich Siegel.
*  If we allow this sale to go through, we are enabling a local synagogue to violate both
*  domestic anti-discrimination laws and international law.
*  Now, there's other reasons we shouldn't allow it, okay?
*  There's a genocide going on right now.
*  In Texas, President Biden and former President Trump traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday
*  trips to tout ever-harsher immigration policies.
*  Trump visited Eagle Pass with Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, while Biden spoke from
*  Brownsville, where he appealed to Trump to work together to lobby Congress on a border
*  deal.
*  Here's what I would say to Mr. Trump.
*  Instead of playing politics with this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to
*  block this legislation, join me, or I'll join you, in telling the Congress to pass
*  this bipartisan border security bill.
*  We can do it together.
*  You know and I know it's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security
*  bill this country has ever seen.
*  Their visit came on the same day a federal judge temporarily blocked a sweeping new Texas
*  law that would have allowed police to arrest anyone suspected of entering the United States
*  without authorization.
*  SB 4 had been set to go into effect next week.
*  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held a special hearing Thursday on climate
*  change fuel displacement.
*  It's part of an effort to have the organization formally recognize forced migration due to
*  the climate crisis and establish legal protections for climate refugees and internally displaced
*  people.
*  Eugenio Abelto-Ramirez from Honduras is a survivor of last year's deadly fire at a migrant
*  in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which killed 43 people.
*  He was trying to make his way to the U.S. after he lost his livelihood when the shrimp
*  farm where he worked was destroyed due to rising sea levels.
*  This is part of his testimony voiced over by an interpreter.
*  And let us not be looked at as scant thing.
*  Oh, God, here comes some more immigrants.
*  Block the border.
*  We have human rights.
*  We simply are hoping for the chance of a better life.
*  That's all we want.
*  And I can only hope, thank God, that the governments would get together and understand the situation
*  and somehow find some decent, some humane way to address the problem.
*  In the Texas Panhandle, at least two people have been killed as the Smokehouse Creek fire
*  continues to rage.
*  On Thursday, it merged with another wildfire, becoming the largest ever fire in Texas history
*  and the second largest in U.S. history as it spreads into Oklahoma.
*  The flames have engulfed over a million acres, raising entire neighborhoods to the ground.
*  It's just 5 percent contained.
*  The climate crisis is making wildfires more frequent and more devastating.
*  quote, as the largest oil driller and producer in the United States, oil companies in Texas
*  are literally fueling the flames on their doorstep.
*  In Pakistan, the National Assembly swore in newly elected members of Parliament Thursday
*  amidst protests by lawmakers from the party of ousted and jailed former Prime Minister
*  Imran Khan.

*  with his brother Nawaz Sharif.
*  Both men are also former prime ministers.
*  Shabazz Sharif is expected to form a new government after none of the major parties won a majority
*  of parliamentary seats in February's election.
*  Supporters of Imran Khan have accused the military of election tampering.

*  asking him to withhold U.S. recognition of the new Pakistani government until a quote
*  thorough, transparent and credible investigation of election interference has been conducted.
*  In Iran, polls have opened in the first election since an anti-government uprising rocked the
*  country in 2022 following the death of Massa Amini while in police custody.
*  Voters are casting ballots for 290 parliamentary seats and 88 seats on the Assembly of Experts,
*  which appoints the Supreme Leader of Iran.
*  The turnout is expected to be low amidst calls for a boycott and voter disenfranchisement.
*  Jack Teixeira, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, is expected to change
*  his plea to guilty to charges of leaking a series of highly classified Pentagon intelligence
*  documents to a group of gamers on the messaging app Discord.

*  The 22-year-old is scheduled for a Monday hearing in Boston to change his plea.
*  In media news, the Intercept, Ross Dory and Alternet have sued OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing
*  their generative artificial intelligence products of copyright violations.
*  The outlets say their copyrighted content was plagiarized and used to develop and operate
*  the popular AI tool, JAP-Chat, GPT.
*  Ross Dory and Alternet CEO John Byrne said in a statement, quote,
*  "'It's important to democracy that a diverse array of news sites continue to thrive.
*  OpenAI's violations, if not checked, will further decimate the news industry and with
*  that the critical news reporters who affect positive change."
*  Unquote.

*  plus communities.

*  as LGBTQ plus, up to 10 years for advocacy campaigns aimed at children and a maximum
*  Five-year sentence for establishing or funding an LGBTQ plus group.
*  Same sex intercourse is already banned in Ghana.
*  President Nana Akufo Ado has said he would sign the measure into law if the majority
*  of the population supports it.
*  And in Moscow, thousands of mourners have gathered outside a church for Alexei Navalny's
*  funeral amidst heavy police presence.
*  But mourners say it was important for them to be there.
*  I could not not come because I think that I have to give my last respect to this man.
*  Were you afraid?
*  We were very afraid.
*  We arrived early and were standing here for a long time hiding our flowers and cameras.
*  But now I realize that we need to do this and speak up.
*  Hundreds of people have been arrested for publicly mourning Navalny in the two weeks
*  since his death in an Arctic prison.
*  The U.S. rights groups and others have blamed President Putin directly for Navalny's death.
*  Among those spotted at the funeral were recently Kremlin disqualified anti-war Russian presidential
*  candidate Boris Nadezhdin and prominent Putin critic, former mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny
*  Roizman, as well as U.S. French and German diplomats.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
