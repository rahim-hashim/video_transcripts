The legendary folk singer Michael Hurley has died at the age of 83. Born in Bucks County Pennsylvania in 1941, he had a remarkable career that stretched from the 1960s until his sudden death this week at his home in Oregon. In 2020 Hurley stopped by the Democracy Now studio. The initial plan was just for him to record a few songs. He ended up staying in the studio for over an hour for what turned out to be an impromptu concert and discussion about his life and music. He performed many of his most beloved songs including “Oh My Stars,” “Wildegeeses,” “Sweedeedee,” “Portland Water” and “Hog of the Forsaken.”

*  Michael Hurley recorded his first album in 1963 for the iconic Folkways label, the home [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=42.12s)]
*  of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and countless others. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=47.96s)]
*  The album was recorded on the same reel-to-reel machine that taped Leadbelly's last sessions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=51.84s)]
*  One song of note was The Werewolf, which would later be covered by Cat Power, one of many [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=58.72s)]
*  musical acts that found inspiration in Hurley's music. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=64.72s)]
*  Michael Hurley wouldn't record again until 1971, when he released his major label debut, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=69.2s)]
*  Armchair Boogie. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=77.32s)]
*  While it's so poorly at the time, the album is seen today as a classic. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=78.32s)]
*  The album also featured Hurley's distinct artwork. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=83.92s)]

*  many on small independent labels, some even self-released. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=97.82s)]
*  While he never became a household name, Michael Hurley's music inspired many musicians. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  He became known as the godfather of freak folk. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  In recent years, his music popped up in some surprising places, from the HBO series and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  film Deadwood to the film Leave No Trace, where he performed his song Oh My Stars at [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=117.34s)]
*  a Bonfire. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=124.02s)]
*  Ahead of last week's Big Ears Festival, the organizer said, quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=125.02s)]
*  Hurley's music sounds old, like it has always existed, and simultaneously singular, like [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=129.7s)]
*  something you've never heard anyone else play quite like that before, unquote. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=137.1s)]

*  There's a lot more music there are a lot more musicians it seems like too [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1048.14s)]
*  What was it like in the 60s and 70s when you started recording? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1052.5400000000002s)]
*  Well for the difference I remember when I started playing the guitar like in my high school [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1057.02s)]
*  There was a one guy [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1066.14s)]
*  Who played the guitar? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  And it was so unusual that they sent him around to the different classrooms to play the guitar for the students [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1070.7s)]
*  And uh, I started playing the guitar actually after he did [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1079.5s)]
*  And then [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1085.18s)]
*  I was learning [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1086.94s)]
*  If I was driving around like with my sisters or some friends and we'd go to a different town or something [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1088.78s)]
*  We'd see somebody walking down the street with a guitar [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1094.8600000000001s)]
*  We chased him down and say what's that guitar? Yeah, what do you play on it? You know, break it out and see it [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1098.22s)]
*  and now it's less so different that almost [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1105.74s)]
*  seems like [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1108.46s)]
*  Every american must own a guitar. It's a good thing to give somebody and who most influenced you when you started [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1110.46s)]

*  And that river can be like a few inches deep or it can make a flood that's taking shacks off of the banks and stuff [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1253.98s)]
*  And uh, I lived in there along the new river in the northwestern north carolina for a while [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=1262.94s)]

*  Especially by a bunch of younger artists. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2363.82s)]
*  I like that a lot. Lately I really like the Yola Tango did a song of mine called Polynesia. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2367.82s)]
*  How about Kat Power playing Sweetie D? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2380.82s)]
*  That's really good. I like the way when I listen to her play Sweetie D, I go to a whole different place than my version of it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2383.82s)]

*  Boston. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2413.82s)]
*  Can you play just a little snippet? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2416.82s)]
*  It starts out with this monologue thing. I don't know if Kat Power does that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2428.82s)]
*  When I heard her first do it I didn't even know it was Sweetie D until about a minute and a half. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2433.82s)]

*  Baby, I've been having mine. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2551.82s)]
*  You wash the clothes, Sweetie D, and hang them on the line. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2559.82s)]
*  I can see by the way you wash the clothes, your cooking must be fine. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2570.82s)]
*  That's what that's like. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2582.82s)]

*  Just do it for fun. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2607.82s)]
*  If you don't like it, nobody else is going to like it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2612.82s)]
*  If you like it, probably other people will like it too. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2617.82s)]
*  How does it feel to come from rural Oregon to New York City? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2621.82s)]
*  I've practically been coming in New York all my life. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2627.82s)]
*  I can remember being four or five years old following my family around the streets. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2634.82s)]
*  I would fall behind and they'd say, what happened to him? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2642.82s)]
*  He's not with us. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2646.82s)]
*  They'd find me way back looking up at the tall buildings and thinking they were falling over because the clouds were going by. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2648.82s)]
*  In Bucks County it was always kind of there to go to. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2657.82s)]
*  It's always a culture shock in this time too. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2660.82s)]
*  Especially driving through, approaching from Jersey City and going through all the industrial complex that's laid out. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2667.82s)]
*  I think we came in on Highway 80 or 380. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2676.82s)]
*  380 and 80 we came. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2680.82s)]
*  Just looking at the density and the immensity of all the industrial stuff, the electronic stuff and the tanks and the gas and whatever. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2683.82s)]
*  It's always a shock. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2698.82s)]
*  The subway is even always a shock. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2700.82s)]
*  Like last night. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2703.82s)]
*  That would be the first time I'd been in a subway for maybe two years or something. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2705.82s)]
*  And the population itself is... [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2714.82s)]
*  All these things in rural Oregon, you don't get the sense of how many people we are. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2717.82s)]
*  What was the village music scene like in the 60s? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2732.82s)]
*  Can you describe it to people? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2737.82s)]
*  Where were you in New York City? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2740.82s)]
*  There was only one year that I lived in the city through, but I could visit it at will. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2743.82s)]
*  I hitchhiked into the city a lot from Bucks County. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2752.82s)]
*  The first scene I was interested in, you know, about the beatniks era. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2755.82s)]
*  Before it was all folk singers there entertaining. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2765.82s)]
*  There were the beatnik poets. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2769.82s)]
*  That was the game in the village. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2772.82s)]
*  If the cafes didn't have folk singers, at first they had beatnik poets. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2775.82s)]
*  That's what the tourists came to see. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2782.82s)]
*  Like Allen Ginsberg? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2783.82s)]
*  Well, he was one of them. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2786.82s)]
*  I never saw him, but I saw a lot of the other ones. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2788.82s)]
*  Especially Jack Michelin. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2794.82s)]
*  Bunches of them. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2799.82s)]
*  A lot of them that you would never hear of again. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2801.82s)]
*  Shortly after that, it began to be a lot of folk singers. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2806.82s)]
*  Can you play Portland Water for us? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=letOfJmWb2k&t=2813.82s)]
