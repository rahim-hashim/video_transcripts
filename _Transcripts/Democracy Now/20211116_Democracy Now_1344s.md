# Historian Alfred McCoy Predicts the U.S. Empire is Collapsing as China’s Power Grows
**Democracy Now!:** [November 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HendU4zRg9A)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
*  President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have spoken for three and a half hours in
*  a virtual summit Monday night.
*  The meeting took place just days after the U.S. and China announced plans to work together
*  to confront the climate emergency.
*  Tensions have been rising between the two nations, with some saying a new Cold War is
*  During the summit, Xi warned Biden supporting Taiwanese independence would be, quote,
*  playing with fire.
*  He also criticized the U.S. for building new alliances in the Pacific region to counter
*  China's rise.
*  Xi said dividing the world into blocks would, quote,
*  inevitably bring disaster to the world.
*  Biden raised concerns about China's human rights record and what the U.S. has described
*  as unfair trade and economic policies.
*  Both leaders spoke publicly as the summit began.
*  This is Xi Jinping.
*  As the world's two largest economies and the permanent members of the UN Security Council,
*  China and the United States need to increase communications and cooperation.
*  We should each run our domestic affairs well and at the same time shoulder our share of
*  international responsibilities and work together for the most noble cause of world peace and
*  development.
*  This is the common aspiration of our people in China and the United States as well as
*  the people of all countries in the world, and it is also the common mission of the leaders
*  of China and the United States.
*  A sound Chinese-U.S. relationship is required for advancing our two countries, respective
*  development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable international environment, including
*  finding effective responses to global challenges such as climate change and the COVID pandemic.
*  And this is President Biden speaking from the Roosevelt Room at the White House at the
*  start of the virtual summit with the Chinese president.
*  I'm happy we had some time to meet, and I look forward to a candid and forthright
*  discussion like all the discussions we've had thus far.
*  It seems to me our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States to ensure that
*  the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or
*  unintended.
*  It seems to me we need to establish some common-sense guardrails to be clear and honest where we
*  disagree and work together where interests intersect, especially on vital global issues
*  like climate change.
*  Our bilateral relationship evolves seems to me to have a profound impact not only on our
*  countries but, quite frankly, the rest of the world.
*  Both men were surrounded by each flag of China and the United States.
*  To talk more about the U.S.-China relations, we're joined by Alfred McCoy, professor
*  of history at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
*  His latest book is out today, To Govern the Globe, World Orders and Catastrophic Change.
*  McCoy writes, While Washington was spilling its blood and treasure into desert sands,
*  Beijing had been investing much of its accumulated trade surplus in the integration of the world
*  island of Africa, Asia and Europe into an economic powerhouse.
*  Alfred McCoy, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  So, if you can talk about this summit, you wouldn't quite understand the kind of tension
*  that is between the United States and China right now, the world's two largest economies.
*  But if you can talk about the significance of this and then how close we are to a Cold
*  War or hot war with China.
*  The key issue in terms of immediate conflict between Washington and Beijing is Taiwan.
*  As you said earlier, Amy, you know, President Xi of China said that the United States was
*  playing with fire over Taiwan.
*  By way of background, President Xi has committed himself within China to the reunification
*  of Taiwan with China.
*  He wants that to be a critical part of his legacy.
*  And on the other side, President Biden stated just last month in his town meeting that the
*  United States was committed to the defense of Taiwan.
*  So here we have two leaders taking positions over Taiwan, which if they're fully pursued,
*  will lead to conflict.
*  This is another problem for the United States.
*  The New York Times has reported that the Pentagon has wargamed a war over Taiwan between the
*  United States and China.
*  And in the last 18 of these war games, the United States has lost 18 times.
*  China has the world's most sophisticated anti-ballistic missiles, the most sophisticated missile defense.
*  Taiwan is extremely close to China.
*  And if the United States moved aircraft carriers into the Taiwan Straits, like we did in the
*  last conflict back in the 1990s, China could destroy those aircraft carriers.
*  It could sink those aircraft carriers.
*  So the United States, in the immediate future, is faced with the possibility of fighting
*  war over Taiwan.
*  And if that conflict emerged, the United States would have to either retreat in defeat and
*  see Taiwan conquered, or the United States would have to go to war and fight a war that
*  it would probably lose.
*  And that's one issue, but there's also a deeper geopolitical struggle going on.
*  Over the past five centuries, every world hegemon has done one thing the same way.
*  Every world hegemon, from Portugal to Holland to Britain to the United States and now China,
*  has dominated the Eurasian landmass, which today is home to 70 percent of the world's
*  population and productivity.
*  And with the $4 trillion that China made by 2014 as a result of its open trade with the
*  United States, China's invested $1.2 trillion in this massive infrastructure, laying down
*  a steel grid of rail, road, and gas pipeline, integrating the vast Eurasian landmass into
*  a single market in which trade and power, as if by natural law, is going to flow towards
*  Beijing.
*  China is also working to break the U.S. geopolitical hold over the Eurasian landmass.
*  During the Cold War, we controlled what are known as the axial ends of Eurasia through
*  the NATO alliance in Western Europe and four bilateral treaties with mutual defense treaties
*  with Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and Australia.
*  And from these two axial positions, we ringed Eurasia with bands of steel, aircraft carriers,
*  jets, fighter bombers to dominate Eurasia.
*  And now China is punching through those circles of steel, breaking the U.S. geopolitical grip
*  over Eurasia and, through the Belt and Road Initiative, consolidating its control.
*  Moreover, China has built 40 ports ringing the Eurasian landmass down the coast of Africa.
*  So the combination of this geopolitical circling of the coastlines of Eurasia combined with
*  this massive grid of infrastructure across the continent is placing China in control
*  where it is going to dominate the Eurasian landmass.
*  And that is the key to geopolitical power, has been for the last five centuries and will
*  likely be for the rest of this century as well.
*  Well, Professor McCoy, I'd like to ask you a couple of things about that.
*  First of all, we talk about China and the U.S. as if they are two separate economic
*  spheres, so often they're regarded that way in competition.
*  But hasn't American capitalism depended for decades on the Chinese working class to produce
*  its goods at low-wage levels?
*  So in a growing rift between China and the U.S., which economy is likely to suffer the
*  more profound upheaval?
*  That's the key difference when people talk about a new Cold War.
*  That's the difference between the old Cold War and the new Cold War, as you absolutely
*  correctly pointed out.
*  It is the economic interdependence between these two global superpowers.
*  Since 2001, China has integrated its economy into the U.S. supply chain.
*  The two economies are absolutely intertwined.
*  They account arguably for as much as 40 percent of world trade together.
*  And there's no way that this is going to be disaggregated.
*  China is economically dependent on its exports to the United States.
*  That's the source of this vast amount of money.
*  The $4 trillion all came primarily from U.S. trade.
*  Simultaneously, the U.S. consumer economy is integrated with Chinese factories.
*  So they're economically interdependent.
*  That's the key difference.
*  On the other hand, the competition is also very, very real.
*  And China is hoping to surpass the United States economically.
*  By the end of this decade, China's economy is going to be, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers,
*  the international accounting firm, going to be at least 50 percent larger than the U.S. economy.
*  And that is going to give China enormous economic leverage.
*  Moreover, by the end of this decade, I think that they will be able to survive an economic
*  break with the United States because, of course, they're spreading that economic control around
*  the globe.
*  So they are superseding us.
*  In terms of real value, what you can buy for yuan or a dollar, China's economy is already
*  right now probably larger than the U.S. economy.
*  But by the end of the decade, it'll be clearly larger, at least 50 percent larger.
*  And from that economic control, China will be able to expand its military in a number of military
*  fields like any ballistic missiles.
*  They're already ahead of us.
*  They're building their navy.
*  They're going to be working very hard to push us beyond what China calls the first island chain,
*  which America calls the Pacific littoral, that string of islands off the coast of Asia from Japan
*  through Okinawa, Taiwan, and all the way down to Australia.
*  China wants to push us out of that.
*  They want to push us back to the mid-Pacific.
*  They want to split the Pacific Ocean down the middle.
*  And China's navy is getting to the point where they might be able to do that.
*  Well, but let me ask you, on this issue of the move toward hegemony, let's say, of the Chinese
*  nation and economy, isn't there a big difference in terms of the use of military force?
*  The last time that I recall China was engaged in a shooting war was more than 40 years ago in
*  Vietnam or with Vietnam.
*  But in that 40-year period, the United States has been involved in military—this is a declining
*  economic power—has been involved in military interventions in Panama, Grenada, Libya,
*  Afghanistan, two wars in Iraq, the Balkans, and not to mention all the military attacks and drone
*  strikes in Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan.
*  This is all in the period from which China has been involved in no military intervention.
*  China has all these ports, but it doesn't have the worldwide military presence that would
*  make it what would be called an aggressor nation, don't you think?
*  Well, first of all, your recounting of our recent history is absolutely accurate, of course.
*  Two things about that.
*  First of all, over the last 20 years, the bulk of our military operations, as we all know,
*  has been focused in the greater Middle East.
*  And the strategic logic of that was, in effect, securing the Middle Eastern oil, giving us kind
*  of a permanent presence that will give us absolute access to Middle East oil.
*  And we were doing that at the time when that oil was about to join
*  cordwood and coal as superseded sources of fuel.
*  So we invested $8 trillion, $10 trillion in securing a commodity
*  which was passing into the dustbin of history.
*  So it was a gross strategic miscalculation.
*  When the history of the U.S. Empire is written in 2030, when it's over,
*  that will probably go down as one of the greatest strategic miscalculations in U.S. history.
*  And then militarily, the point of naval expansion is not so much conflict.
*  Most people don't understand that.
*  Most people think of naval history just in terms of wars.
*  But what do navies do?
*  The oceans are a global commons.
*  And the way that a rising global hegemon secures oceans is through weaving an invisible
*  line of constant patrols and dominance over those open spaces to claim it strategically,
*  and also in terms of the minerals and values and fishing beneath the sea, to claim that as well.
*  So that's what China's doing.
*  China is weaving those lines of constant patrols by air and sea all the way to the First Island
*  Chain, pushing us back, building seven island bases in the Spratly Islands and the South China
*  Sea, pushing in the East China Sea.
*  So it's part of an imperial game that's been played for 500 years.
*  And China is doing that quite successfully.
*  Professor McCoy, you recently wrote a piece for Tom Dispatch headlined
*  The Winner in Afghanistan, China.
*  Why do you believe that China has emerged stronger after the U.S.
*  withdrawal from Afghanistan?
*  Talk about what geopolitical role Afghanistan plays and the difference in how the U.S.
*  engaged in this forever war in Afghanistan and China's relationship with it.
*  Sure. In terms of President Xi's strategy, which he announced in 2013,
*  under the Belt and Road Initiative, what he was going to do and what he's been doing
*  is turning the vast Eurasian landmass into a single market linked by infrastructure.
*  And if you will, the kind of hole in the doughnut,
*  crude metaphor, apologies, the hole in the doughnut was Afghanistan.
*  In terms of that network of massive natural gas pipelines going across the heart of Central Asia,
*  the one connection that couldn't be made was from Central Asia down to the energy
*  deficit areas of Pakistan and India.
*  And that had to pass through Afghanistan.
*  And by bringing Afghanistan with the gas pipelines to the north,
*  the China-Pakistan economic corridor to the east, and then just this year,
*  a massive economic agreement between China and Iran to build rail and gas pipelines,
*  in effect, China surrounded Afghanistan with these lines of steel and was just waiting for
*  Afghanistan to fall into its hands without a shot fired. And in July, a month before the Taliban
*  took power, they sent a top-level delegation to China and met with China's foreign minister.
*  And they worked out an agreement that the Taliban would promote and allow Chinese investment.
*  And there's another great prize in Afghanistan. Geologists estimate that there's about a billion
*  dollars of rare earth minerals critical for the construction of lithium batteries, which are going
*  to fuel our transport and much of our reserve power as we switch from fossil fuels to solar power.
*  That Afghanistan has a billion dollars of rare earth minerals that are very valuable to China,
*  indeed to the whole international economy. And China will begin developing those in conjunction
*  with the Taliban. So, in effect, China just sat back, surrounded Afghanistan with its geopolitical
*  network and waited for it to fall right into its hands. And they didn't pay at all. And we spent
*  a trillion dollars on Afghanistan and got nothing. It was a great deal.
*  And Professor McCoy, I wanted to ask you, in this conflict between China and the United States,
*  these two countries are not alone, obviously. The Belt and Road Initiative is meant to win
*  friendship and support to China from other parts of the world. I'm wondering if you would talk
*  about countries like Russia and Iran you mentioned, in terms of where they would stand in a developing
*  conflict with the United States, and also about Latin America, which China has probably been the
*  only major power to make significant inroads into a continent or an area of the world that
*  used to be considered the U.S. backyard. Sure. First of all, in Latin America,
*  China has an explicit strategy of resource development with Latin America,
*  and its trade with our own southern neighbors is already larger than our own.
*  China, the core of China's strategy is what the father of modern geopolitics, a British
*  geographer named Sir Halford McKinder called the World Island. And he looked at the map in an
*  article in 1904, over 100 years ago, and he said, let's look at the map critically. And he said,
*  what we see is that there are three continents that are close together that form the World Island,
*  Europe, Asia, and Africa. And he said, whoever dominates the pivot region, the heart in Central
*  Asia of this World Island dominates the world. And from his perspective, these three continents
*  were the core of geopolitical power. And then there were some small outlying islands like Greenland
*  and North America and South America. So part of China's strategy has been, and actually this
*  dates back all the way to the 1970s, to very seriously develop Africa and to bring Africa
*  into the world economy through Chinese aid development and trade links. And at the same
*  time during the Cold War that we were playing a 20-year game in Angola to disrupt and break
*  the Marxist government there, which didn't work in the end, and we were allied with apartheid South
*  Africa, China was building the Tanzan Railroad from Tanzania ultimately across the breadth of
*  Africa, its first major international development aid project. And so China, from that basis all the
*  way back to 1970s, built relations with the liberation governments, which are now of course
*  the main governments in the southern half of Africa. And so China has brought Africa very
*  much into the international economy. China is by far and away the key investor in Africa.
*  We regard Africa as kind of a band-aid and it's very well motivated of course, but again,
*  we see sort of Africa as a charity case. China, by contrast, sees Africa as a key to its emerging
*  world power. It's the home to nearly a third of humanity, enormous amount of natural resources,
*  potential markets. So China is building a very close relationship with Africa as a part of this
*  tricontinental world island strategy to dominate the core of humanity, the core of the modern
*  economy. Finally, Professor McCoy, I wanted to end in a different place, but there may be a connection
*  and that's the insurrection of January 6th. You write in another piece about how this reminded you
*  of a Kuiw witness in the Philippines decades ago.
*  Yeah, in 1986, I was in the Philippines and one of my sources in the Philippine military
*  tipped me off that the Marcos government, the Marcos had fled into exile in Hawaii
*  and the great people power uprising of a million Filipinos in the streets of Manila had established
*  her democracy. His loyalists met and they seized the Manila hotel and they shook Philippine
*  democracy to the point that there were a succession of major coups, armed coups that really shook
*  the Philippine democracy. And what I learned from this is that democracy is very fragile
*  and that January 6th uprising in Washington, D.C. was a coup and it has shaken our democracy to the
*  core and we have to be very serious about reconstructing our democracy after that episode.
*  We will leave it there, but so many other issues to discuss. Alfred McCoy,
*  professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His newest book is out
*  today. It's called To Govern the Globe, World Orders and Catastrophic Change.
