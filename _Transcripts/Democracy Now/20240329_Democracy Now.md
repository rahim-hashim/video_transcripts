# Top U.S. & World Headlines — March 29, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bofOHgXeSXc)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, DemocracyNow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to ensure unhindered aid can get into
*  Gaza.
*  The legally binding order was issued after a request by South Africa, which brought the
*  genocide case against Israel to the ICJ in January.
*  The court noted in its latest order, quote, Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing
*  only a risk of famine, but famine is setting in, they said.
*  The judges also cite U.N. data, which finds, quote, at least 31 people, including 27 children,
*  having already died of malnutrition and dehydration, unquote.
*  Israel is required to submit a report to the ICJ in a month showing how it has implemented
*  the order.
*  In northern Gaza, where the U.N. warns famine is imminent, the Kamal Adwan Hospital is seeing
*  an increasing number of extremely underweight babies and children.
*  This is Nurse Ahmed Al-Ali.
*  We received this case about an hour ago, a malnutrition case.
*  We got used to receiving such cases daily.
*  She is suffering as a result of a lack of nutrients she's receiving.
*  You can tell that her age doesn't match her weight.
*  She's two months old, and yet she's only two kilos and some fractions.
*  My shift in the intensive care does not go without three or four cases of this kind,
*  from bad to worse, and the result is death.
*  The official death toll in Gaza has now topped 32,600.
*  In Syria, Israeli airstrikes near Aleppo killed some 40 people, according to the U.K.-based
*  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
*  State media reports civilians are among the dead and injured.
*  The attack struck missile depots used by Hezbollah and reportedly killed at least five Hezbollah
*  fighters.
*  Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in near-daily skirmishes across the Israel-Lebanon border
*  since October 7th.
*  Hebrew University in Jerusalem has reinstated Professor Nedra Shalhub Kavorkian, the internationally
*  renowned feminist Palestinian professor who was suspended earlier this month after saying
*  in an interview Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.
*  Hebrew University reportedly did not demand she recount those remarks, but did reinstate
*  her after she clarified her remarks on reports of sexual assaults during the October 7th
*  attacks.
*  The suspension had been met with protests from students and faculty of the school.
*  You can see our interview with Nedra Shalhub Kavorkian at democracynow.org.
*  Here in New York, President Biden appeared with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill
*  Clinton in a massive campaign fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall Thursday night.
*  The star-studded event featured musical performances, and the conversation with the three presidents
*  was moderated by The Late Show host Stephen Colbert.
*  Outside the venue, thousands of activists gathered to protest U.S. support for Israel's
*  war on Gaza.
*  It's an issue of them funding and facilitating this genocide that's carried out by Israel.
*  They are supporting the death of over 40,000 people, and this is not the first time they've
*  supported death and war.
*  And people are sick of that.
*  People are going hungry in this city.
*  People don't have a place to sleep.
*  And all the while, we're sending billions of dollars to Israel to kill Palestinians
*  and to steal their land.
*  Inside the event, the largest presidential campaign fundraiser in history, activists
*  repeatedly disrupted Biden's conversation, shouting, Stop arming Israel, let Gaza live,
*  and shame on you.
*  We'll hear more of those voices later in the broadcast.
*  A new Gallup poll found that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of Israel's military
*  actions in Gaza, up 10 percentage points from November.
*  Earlier in the day, activists held vigil on the steps of New York City Hall.
*  Organized by the Slow Factory, activists read out names of Palestinians killed since October
*  7th.
*  This is Viviane Sansour from the Palestine Heirloom Seed Library.
*  The soil has become so toxic because of the amount of bombs, from white phosphorus to
*  all kinds of other ammunition.
*  And, you know, the infrastructure was destroyed, so there's also sewage.
*  There's so many diseases.
*  So, a lot of our trees, which for us, our trees are part of our family, they are part
*  of our kin, and they are being destroyed, too.
*  In voting news, a federal court ruled South Carolina can use a Republican gerrymandered
*  congressional map for the upcoming U.S. House election.
*  This despite the same court ruling last year, it was unconstitutional and that it exiled
*  more than 30,000 black residents from the Charleston area district.
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to issue a decision on the ruling's challenge, allowing
*  it to stay in place at least through the 2024 elections.
*  The seat is currently held by the Trump endorsed Congressmember Nancy Mace, who's running
*  for reelection.
*  Meanwhile, in Florida, a federal court allowed a gerrymandered map that sidelines black voters
*  to remain in place.
*  The map was created in 2022 after Republican Governor Ron DeSantis set out to dismantle
*  the northern district of former Congressmember Al Lawson, a black Democrat.
*  In other voting news, a Texas court of appeals has reversed the conviction of Crystal Mason,
*  a black woman who faced five years in prison for submitting a provisional ballot in 2016,
*  even though she was barred from voting due to a past felony conviction.
*  Mason was unaware she was not eligible to vote and the provisional ballot was never
*  counted as a vote.
*  Crystal Mason celebrated the win Thursday saying, quote, I was thrown into this fight
*  for voting rights and will keep swinging to ensure no one else has to face what I've
*  endured for over six years, a political ploy where minority voting rights are under attack,
*  she said.
*  To see our interview with Crystal Mason, go to democracynow.org.
*  The Biden administration's restored a series of wildlife protections under the Endangered
*  Species Act that were rolled back under President Trump.
*  This includes reinstating certain protections for species classified as threatened with
*  extinction and taking into greater consideration the threat of climate change when issuing
*  protections.
*  Sam Bankman Fried, the disgraced founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX,
*  was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy.
*  District Judge Lewis Kaplan noted Bankman Fried's, quote, apparent lack of any remorse,
*  unquote, for defrauding FTX customers out of at least $8 billion.
*  Bankman Fried's lawyer said they plan to appeal.
*  A federal judge has tossed Elon Musk's lawsuit against the Watchdog Center for
*  Countering Digital Hate, writing in his ruling, quote, This case is about punishing the
*  defendants for their speech.
*  Elon Musk sued the nonprofit after they reported that hate speech, racism and misinformation
*  soared on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after the billionaire took
*  ownership of the site in 2022.
*  The Center for Countering Digital Hate welcomed the lawsuit's dismissal, writing on X, quote,
*  will continue exposing hate and lies on X and campaigning for social media bosses like
*  Musk to be held accountable.
*  To see our interview about this case with the head of the Center for Countering Digital
*  Hate, go to democracynow.org.
*  Colombia has expelled its Argentine diplomats as tensions between the Argentine President
*  Javier Millet and his leftist Latin American counterparts reach new heights this week.
*  Excerpts from a new CNN interview with Millet show the right-wing leader lashing out at
*  Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and
*  attacking Venezuela and Cuba.
*  GUSTAVO PETRO, Colombian President, Translator, Translator
*  The butchery in Venezuela is unheard of, same with the jail that is Cuba.
*  There are other cases that are on their way to becoming like Venezuela, such as Colombia
*  with Mr. Petro.
*  We cannot expect much from someone who was a murderer, terrorist and communist.
*  AMY GOODMAN, National Public Radio, CNN, The New York Times
*  President Millet was referencing Colombian President Petro's history as a former member
*  of the M-19 rebel movement.
*  Millet also called López Obrador ignorant.
*  Among other things, the leaders are at odds over their support for Israel's assault on
*  Gaza.
*  Millet is a staunch supporter of Israel, while Petro earlier this week threatened to
*  diplomatic ties with Israel if it ignores the U.N. Security Council resolution calling
*  for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  And Saudi Arabia was chosen to chair the U.N. commission on the status of women.
*  Rights groups expressed outrage at the news.
*  Amnesty International's deputy director of advocacy, Shireen Padra, said, quote,
*  Saudi Arabia's abysmal record when it comes to protecting and promoting the rights of women
*  puts a spotlight on the vast gulf between the lived reality for women and girls in Saudi Arabia
*  and the aspirations of the commission, unquote.
*  Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report condemning a leaked draft of Saudi
*  Arabia's first written penal code, which Amnesty says criminalizes free speech, homosexuality
*  and abortion, and fails to protect women and girls from all forms of gender-based violence.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
