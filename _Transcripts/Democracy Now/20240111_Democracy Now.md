# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 11, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkC1t35EHM)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The International Court of Justice in The Hague has begun hearing two days of arguments
*  in South Africa's historic genocide case against Israel.
*  South Africa has accused Israel of violating the 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention, saying
*  its three-month assault on Gaza is being conducted with the intent to bring about the destruction
*  of Palestinians as a group.
*  South Africa is outlining its case today.
*  Israel will defend itself on Friday.
*  During today's hearing, attorneys for the South African government laid out what they
*  described as Israel's genocidal intent.
*  Israel has a genocidal intent against the Palestinians in Gaza.
*  That is evident from the way in which Israel's military attack is being conducted.
*  Israel's special genocidal intent is rooted in the belief that, in fact, the enemy is
*  not just the military wing of Hamas or, indeed, Hamas generally, but is embedded in the fabric
*  of Palestinian life in Gaza.
*  We'll have more on the genocide hearing after headlines.
*  An Israeli airstrike hit an ambulance in central Gaza Wednesday, killing two patients and four
*  members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
*  The aid group said, quote, Our colleagues were intentionally targeted while inside an
*  ambulance clearly marked with the Red Crescent emblem, unquote.
*  Another Israeli attack near the entrance to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital killed eight
*  people and wounded over 30.
*  On Wednesday, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adnan Ghebreyesus, called
*  on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza.
*  Delivering humanitarian aid in Gaza continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges.
*  Intense bombardment, restrictions on movement, fuel shortages, and interrupted communications
*  make it impossible for WHO and our partners to reach those in need.
*  We have the supplies, the teams, and the plans in place.
*  What we don't have is access.
*  Five armed men wearing military uniforms have reportedly seized an oil tanker in the Gulf
*  of Oman.
*  This comes as tensions have been soaring for weeks in the Red Sea.
*  On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for Yemen's Houthi forces
*  to stop attacking ships in the Red Sea.
*  The vote came a day after U.S. and British forces shot down 21 drones and missiles fired
*  by the Houthis, who vowed to continue attacks until Israel halts its assault on Gaza.
*  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis squared
*  off at a CNN-hosted debate in Iowa ahead of the state's January 15th caucus.
*  Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who's yet to participate in a primary debate, had
*  been invited to attend but opted to take part in a Fox News town hall instead.
*  DeSantis criticized Haley for supporting sending more money in arms to Ukraine.
*  She supports this $106 billion that they're trying to get through Congress.
*  Where's some of that money going?
*  They've done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats.
*  They've paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars.
*  We've got homeless veterans.
*  We have all these problems.
*  This is the U.N. way of thinking that we're somehow globalist and we have unlimited resources
*  to do.
*  You know, I think here's the problem.
*  You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can't take the United Nations
*  out of the ambassador.
*  Nikki Haley questioned Ron DeSantis about whether he's ready to run the country.
*  The best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they've run their campaign.
*  He has blown through $150 million.
*  I don't even know how you do that.
*  Through his campaign, he has nothing to show for it.
*  He spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans
*  to vote for him.
*  If you can't manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country?
*  Hours before the debate, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped out of the
*  race.
*  He was caught on a hot mic saying, she's going to get smoked, in an apparent reference
*  to Haley.
*  Christie also predicted DeSantis would drop out after Iowa.
*  In other Trump news, closing arguments are scheduled for today in New York in the civil
*  fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Donald Trump.
*  On Wednesday, the judge in the case struck down a request by Trump to deliver his own
*  closing statement because the former president's legal team refused to abide by the judge's
*  restrictions not to turn his remarks into a campaign speech.
*  On Capitol Hill, far-right Republicans are pushing back against House Speaker Mike Johnson
*  after he reached a bipartisan $1.59 trillion spending deal with Democratic Senate Majority
*  Leader Chuck Schumer.
*  On Wednesday, a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus joined Democrats to block an
*  unrelated bill to show their opposition to Johnson's deal.
*  Meanwhile, a pair of House committees have voted to endorse a report recommending Hunter
*  Biden's son be held in contempt of Congress.
*  On Wednesday, Hunter Biden made a surprise appearance at a House Oversight Committee
*  meeting and offered to testify publicly, but Republicans refused.
*  They've been insisting on questioning him in private.
*  In other House news, Republican lawmakers held their first impeachment hearing focused
*  on Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
*  Police have arrested at least 333 people in a nationwide crackdown after President Daniel
*  Niboa declared a state of emergency due to a surge in violence by drug cartels.
*  During an interview Wednesday, Niboa said,
*  Equador is now in a state of war.
*  Schools across Ecuador will remain shut down until at least Friday.
*  Authorities in South Korea have confirmed the recent stabbing of opposition leader Lee
*  Jae-mung was a politically motivated attack.
*  Lee Jae-mung, who survived the assassination attempt, ran for president in 2022 and narrowly
*  lost to conservative Yoon Suk-yul.
*  Police said the attacker wanted to prevent him from running for president again in 2027.
*  This is Busan Police Commissioner Woo Chol-moon.
*  The suspect stated that he held a grudge that the victim, Lee Jae-mung, was not properly
*  punished and he wanted to prevent the victim from becoming president, stop him from giving
*  nominations to certain groups and taking a majority of seats in the upcoming general
*  election.
*  That is why he decided to kill the victim.
*  In health news, wastewater testing shows the U.S. is in its greatest COVID-19 surge since
*  Omicron, making it the second largest surge of the pandemic.
*  Around 1,500 people in the U.S. are still dying from COVID every week.
*  Public health experts say two of the main reasons are waning immunity and not enough
*  people accessing treatments and vaccinations.
*  Rates of infection are up globally as well.
*  The World Health Organization reports 10,000 COVID deaths were recorded in December while
*  hospitalizations increased in dozens of countries.
*  In Spain, authorities have reissued face mask mandates and health facilities.
*  It's a basic and minimum measure, which we learned from the pandemic, and that is,
*  when we have an upward trend, the first thing we need to do is protect the most vulnerable
*  people, people who have some sort of infection that needs to be contained.
*  And the method that is most scientifically endorsed is the mask.
*  In Ohio, Republican House legislators voted Wednesday to overturn Republican Governor
*  Mike DeWine's veto of legislation that would ban gender-affirming health care for transgender
*  youth and bar trans athletes from playing on school sports teams.
*  Three-fifths of the Ohio Senate must also vote to override DeWine's veto for the bill
*  to become law.
*  The ACLU of Ohio slammed state Republicans, saying, quote, This state-sponsored vendetta
*  against some of Ohio's most vulnerable young people is beyond cruel, they said.
*  In related news, two transgender women vying for seats in the Ohio House of Representatives
*  have been challenged for not disclosing their birth names on nominating petitions.
*  Both women said they were unaware of the rule, but that they would have complied despite
*  the harmful nature of the requirement.
*  One of the women, Ariane Childry, said of the rule, quote, Having to use your dead name
*  is horrible.
*  It's an attack on who we are, unquote.
*  Vanessa Joy, who's appealing the decision last week to disqualify her, also warned that
*  transgender people should not be forced to share their dead names due to safety concerns.
*  Here in New York, lawsuits filed by prisoners at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility
*  accuse guards of abuse and torture.
*  Two men, 44-year-old Charles Wright and 32-year-old Eugene Taylor, say they were brutally beaten
*  by guards who also took them to another facility where they were waterboarded.
*  Both men say they were falsely accused of disciplinary infractions after the event.
*  A separate lawsuit filed by 44 prisoners says guards inflicted physical and psychological
*  abuse on prisoners during an October lockdown, including violently attacking them.
*  Great Meadow Prison is located in Comstock, about 200 miles north of New York City.
*  In North Carolina, Ronnie Long was awarded an historic $25 million settlement for his
*  wrongful conviction and 44-year-long imprisonment.
*  Long is a black man.
*  He was accused of raping a white woman by an all-white jury in 1976.
*  He was exonerated and released in 2020 after a court ruled his due process rights were
*  violated, citing extreme and continuous police misconduct, which included concealing lab evidence
*  that showed Long was not linked to the crime scene.
*  Ronnie Long has put some funds from a previous settlement towards efforts to reform the criminal
*  justice system.
*  The family of the late Eddie Bernice Johnson, the trailblazing black congressmember from
*  Texas, has blamed a Dallas rehabilitation facility for her death and say they'll file
*  a lawsuit for medical neglect.
*  Her family says the spine infection that led to her death December 31 developed following
*  back surgery after staff at the Baylor's Scott and White Institute left her lying in
*  her own feces.
*  Eddie Bernice Johnson was the first registered nurse elected to Congress, where she served
*  for three decades.
*  On Tuesday, loved ones and community members gathered for her funeral at Concord Church
*  in Dallas.
*  Among those who paid their respects were lawmakers who were inspired and guided by Johnson.
*  This is Royce West, Texas state senator.
*  What she made certain of is that issues concerning health care, accessible health care, that
*  we worked on those issues, higher education, education, historically underutilized businesses,
*  building coalitions based on interests, not based on the color of one's skin, gender,
*  a political affiliation.
*  And she often told us, just because you speak loud, don't mean you're going to be able
*  to get anything done.
*  Her life is a manifestation of that.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
