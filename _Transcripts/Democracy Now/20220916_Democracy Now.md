# "The Myth of Normal": Dr. Gabor Maté on Trauma, Illness and Healing in a Toxic Culture
**Democracy Now!:** [September 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvSL6RZCkyI)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  Today, we spend the hour with Dr. Gabor Mate, the acclaimed Canadian physician and author.
*  He's just out with a new book, The Myth of Normal, Trauma, Illness and Healing in a Toxic
*  Culture.
*  Dr. Mate has worked for decades in Vancouver as a family physician, palliative care director,
*  addiction clinician and observer of human health.
*  Dr. Mate's work has long focused on the centrality of early childhood experiences
*  to the development of the brain and how those experiences can impact everything from behavioral
*  patterns to physical and mental illness.
*  Over the years, he's written a number of bestselling books, including In the Realm
*  of Hungry Ghosts, Close Encounters with Addiction, When the Body Says No, Exploring the Stress-Disease
*  Connection and Scattered Minds, the Origins and Healing of Attention Deficit Disorder.
*  In a moment, we'll speak to Dr. Gabor Mate, but first I want to turn to a trailer of
*  a documentary about his work titled The Wisdom of Trauma.
*  In the U.S., the richest society in history, fully half of the citizens have a chronic
*  disorder such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
*  Anxiety amongst young people is growing rapidly.
*  Asthma and autoimmune diseases are on the rise as are addictions.
*  Depression is rising.
*  With suicides rising, all is not well.
*  I started heroin at 26.
*  That's what really destroyed me.
*  Just takes the pain away.
*  It's easy to want to escape reality completely instead of coping with it.
*  And so the question is, can we be human beings in the midst of civilization?
*  Because what we call civilization demands the denial of human needs.
*  Please welcome Dr. Gabor Mate.
*  I've been human being as a true, genuine, authentic self.
*  And the trauma is that disconnection from it and the healing is the reconnection with it.
*  Why do we get disconnected?
*  Because it's too painful to be ourselves.
*  So you sort of a bit like in The Matrix when Neo sees everything's made out of numbers,
*  you look at people and you see all their trauma and damage.
*  That's what I see.
*  So trauma is not the bad things that happen to you,
*  but what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you.
*  What do you want to tell me?
*  What comes up right now?
*  Shame.
*  Thank you.
*  My father, he would spank us and take a belt to us.
*  Who do you speak to about your pain?
*  Nobody.
*  Yeah, that's the trauma.
*  In other words, by the time you're five years old, you're completely alone.
*  People are much more lonely and isolated than they used to be.
*  Literally, it causes inflammation in the body and suppresses the immune system.
*  You've been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
*  Correct.
*  In my view, people that develop cancer have a hard time expressing healthy anger.
*  Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, there were two traumatized people fighting to govern a traumatized world.
*  That's exactly what I'm saying.
*  And these are the people that our society rewards with power.
*  Our schools are full of kids with learning difficulties, mental health issues that are
*  trauma-based, but the average teacher never gets a single lecture on trauma.
*  We need trauma-informed medical care, trauma-informed education.
*  If we had a trauma-informed society, we'd have a society that looks much more compassionate.
*  You did. You made a difference in my life.
*  Thank you for being in touch.
*  I don't feel like I'm a bad person anymore.
*  Hey, how are you?
*  I just want people to see the truth.
*  Solutions arise out of people when they confront themselves with the truth,
*  when they're not afraid of the truth.
*  I think the biggest thing that this whole healing journey has taught me is how to be human.
*  The trailer for the film The Wisdom of Trauma, featuring Dr. Gabor Matej, who is our guest for the hour,
*  he's just written a new book with his son Daniel titled The Myth of Normal, Trauma, Illness and
*  Healing in a Toxic Culture. Dr. Matej will be appearing tonight in New York City at the 92nd Street Y.
*  On Thursday, Democracy Now!'s Nermeen Shaikh and I spoke to Gabor Matej.
*  I began by asking him about the pandemic and the book title, The Myth of Normal.
*  So, the pandemic actually revealed to us how toxic our idea of normal has been,
*  because it showed us the desperate need for human connection that we all have.
*  But this is in a culture that has been isolating and atomizing individuals for a long time,
*  where loneliness has been an epidemic for decades.
*  It showed the noxious effect of racism and inequality, because the people who had the
*  the greatest risk for being affected by COVID were those of lower social class and of people of color.
*  The normal that we came from, in my perspective, was already a toxic normal.
*  We don't want to go back to it, because my contention in this book is
*  what we consider to be normal in this society is actually neither natural or healthy.
*  In fact, it's a cause of much human pathology, mental and physical.
*  And actually, people's pathologies, what we call abnormalities, whether it's mental or physical
*  illness, are actually normal responses to what is an abnormal culture.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKHIRI, M.D.
*  And, Dr. Gabor Matej, you say in the book, in fact, that there are no clear lines between normal
*  and abnormal. Could you explain what you mean by that and how you understand
*  the spectrum along which these things lie?
*  DR. GABOR MATEJ, M.D.
*  Well, the key here is trauma. Trauma is a psychological wound that people sustain.
*  And I'm saying that in this society, most of us, because of the nature of the culture,
*  the way we raise children, the way we have to relate to each other, the very values of a society
*  are traumatizing for a lot of people, so that it's false to say that some people are normal
*  and others are abnormal. In fact, we're all on the spectrum of
*  woundedness, which has great impact on how we relate to each other and on our health.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKHIRI, M.D.
*  And, Dr. Matej, explain how you understand, as you say in the book, that the term trauma has
*  Greek origins, but that it's come to mean something quite different. I mean, in the Greek
*  origin, it referred to a physical injury or a physical wound, but in psychiatry and the work
*  of Freud and psychoanalysis, in medical literature, generally now, trauma is understood as a wound
*  to the mind. DR. GABOR MATEJ, M.D.
*  It's a wound to the psyche, to our emotional being, to the soul. And trauma is not what happens
*  to us. People, when they think of trauma, they think usually of catastrophic events, like
*  a tsunami or a war or parents dying or sexual or physical emotional abuse of a child.
*  These events are traumatic, but they're not the trauma. The trauma is the psychic wound that we
*  sustain, and our psychological traumas have lifelong impacts. And in my medical work, I found
*  that psychological trauma, woundedness, underlies much of what we call disease, whether
*  autoimmune illness or cancer or the various mental health conditions. And in our society,
*  psychological woundedness is very prevalent, and it's rather an illusion to believe some people are
*  traumatized and others are not. I think there's a spectrum of trauma that crosses all layers and all
*  segments of society. Naturally, it falls heavier on certain sections, on people of color, people with
*  genders that are not fully accepted by society, people of economic inequality
*  who suffer more from inequality, but the traumatization is pretty general in our culture.
*  Gabor, I was wondering if you could take some time and talk about your own journey from trauma
*  and how it shaped you as an infant and Nazi-occupied, hungry to where you are today
*  and how that has influenced who you are. Well, you know, the first chapter of the book opens with
*  my arrival home to Vancouver, where I live, from a speaking trip. And I'm feeling really good about
*  myself because it was a good trip. My talk was well received and I had a good flight home.
*  And when I arrived back at the airport in Vancouver, I get a text from my wife saying,
*  I haven't left home yet. Do you still want me to come? And all of a sudden, my mood switches. I
*  become dark. I become angry. I become withdrawn. I become sullen. And when I get home, I'm barely
*  even looking at her. Now, what actually happened here? All that happened was that my artist wife,
*  typical of an artist, was in the middle of creative flow in her studio and she forgot that her husband
*  was arriving home at the airport. What was triggered in me, however, was the wound of a
*  one-year-old infant who was abandoned by his mother in an attempt to save my life, actually.
*  But the meaning I made of it is that I wasn't lovable, that I wasn't wanted. And even 71 years
*  later, when this woman I'm relying to be there for me doesn't show up, the woundedness of a
*  one-year-old infant shows up. And that's what my friend Peter Levine calls the tyranny of the past.
*  And so these early wounds, in my case, this sense of abandonment, could still show up seven decades
*  later over a relatively trivial incident. And these early wounds of ours—so that's one way that it
*  showed up. It shows up in my relationship to my work. So I was a workaholic physician
*  for many decades. Why was I a workaholic? Because the message I got as an infant under the Nazis
*  was that the world didn't want me. Now, if the world doesn't want you, one way to cope with it
*  is to make yourself very important, become a helper, become a physician, because now they're
*  going to want you all the time. But that's very addictive because you keep trying to prove to
*  yourself something you don't believe in the first place, which is that you're wanted. And so that
*  the more people rewarded me with either financially or with their attention or their gratitude for my
*  medical work, the more I needed it, the more I became dependent on it. So it shows up in so
*  many ways. These early wounds show up in so many ways. It shows up in our relationships, in our
*  marriages, in our relationship to our children, in our relationship to our work. It shows up in politics,
*  as we've seen during COVID. So these early wounds in my life had had wide-ranging implications,
*  and as they do in the lives of many people. Now you've intrigued us because you said at the time
*  you thought your mother abandoned you, but you, of course, now understand she was doing it to save
*  you. Can you explain what happened? Sure. So I was 11 months of age. My mother was a 24-year-old
*  Jewish woman living under the Nazi occupation, under a viciously anti-Semitic fascist regime
*  in December of 1944. And she found refuge in a safe home run by the Swiss embassy, but
*  there were 2,000 people living there in a home, meant 400 people. The sanitary conditions were
*  terrible. Food was very uncertain. She did—and I was very sick, and she didn't think I would live.
*  So she went under the street and gave me to a Christian woman, a complete stranger,
*  and asked her to take me to some relatives who were living under relatively safer conditions.
*  Her intention was simply to save my life, and she did. But as an 11-month-old, I could only
*  interpret that as an abandonment, because I don't understand the conditions. Now, who gets abandoned?
*  Somebody who is not wanted. So I developed this fixed belief. Okay, I'm not lovable. I'm not
*  wanted. Now, you don't need conditions of war and privation and such drama to give children the
*  sense that they're not wanted. In this society, a lot of parents are advised not to pick up the
*  kids when they're crying. That's enough to give the child the sense that they're not wanted,
*  they're not accepted. And so I was traumatized under very—and so the trauma is not that my
*  mother gave me to a stranger. The trauma is what I made it mean, the wound inside,
*  that I'm not lovable and that I'm not wanted.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH AL-ALI KHAN, M.D. Dr. Mate, let's go back precisely to how you understand and how we
*  should understand the event of trauma. First of all, can trauma arise from a single episode,
*  or is it something that has to, in some form, even if not precisely the same one, be repeated?
*  And to what extent is the fact that you cannot know the trauma when it actually occurs account
*  for the fact that its effects endure and, as you say, show up decades later?
*  Well, as your question implies, trauma can be induced in people in a number of ways. It
*  could be a single dramatic event, the death of a parent, a tremendous loss in life,
*  a terrible explosion. You know, it occurs that way sometimes. And those are relatively easy
*  to identify, and then actually they're easier to deal with. But for a lot of people, it's much more
*  insidious and much more chronic than that. For example, certain child-rearing practices. For
*  decades, Dr. Spock, who was kind of the guru of parenting, advised parents not to give in to the
*  infant's tyranny, the infant's resistance to sleep. Now, what he calls the infant's tyranny
*  is the infant's desperate need to be picked up and held by the parent. That's just a trait that
*  we share with all other mammals. You tell a mother baboon not to pick up their baby,
*  or a mother cat, not to respond to the child's distress. But here in North America, we've been
*  telling parents for decades to ignore their children's cries. Or, for example, when a child
*  is angry, a two-year-old is angry, to give them a timeout, which is to say, to threaten them with
*  the loss of the attachment relationship that they desperately need. Those events are just as traumatic
*  over the long term, but they're harder to identify because they seem so normal and they
*  don't seem dramatic. But they do show up later on in life in all kinds of dysfunctional patterns.
*  And, Dr. Monti, you speak in the book about unresolved traumas. So in the examples that
*  you're giving now, or indeed in the case of trauma more generally, if one can speak generally
*  about trauma, what kinds of practices can lead, if at all, to the resolution of a trauma?
*  Well, whether we're speaking about on a social level, which we have to speak, or whether on the
*  individual level, which is what strikes most of us, the first thing that has to happen is a recognition
*  that how are we living, or some aspect of our lives is not working for us, and that there's a cause for
*  it, which we can actually uncover by some compassionate inquiry. And very often, there needs
*  to be a wake-up call. Now, COVID could have been a wake-up call for this culture, but I don't think
*  it will have worked that way. It should have, but it didn't because of the nature of this society,
*  to transformation, to resistance, to social transformation in this culture so deep that
*  the COVID lessons, I don't think, have been learned nor will be applied. On the individual level,
*  very often it's an illness, whether of a depression and anxiety, a psychiatric diagnosis,
*  a relationship breakup, or a physical illness, like an autoimmune disease or malignancy.
*  That works as the wake-up call. So there's got to be some kind of event that happens that says to
*  us, hmm, this is not working. We need to understand why not. We need to move past it. And once we get
*  that wake-up call, in whatever form—and one of my intentions in this book is to
*  help people not get to that dire dramatic point where some significant illness has to wake them
*  up. But once we get to the point of waking up, then we conduct an inquiry. Okay, what was driving my
*  behaviors? Why was I always driving myself on the job, like as if my life depended on it? Why was
*  I a workaholic stressing myself? Why was I so hard on my children? What is it that makes me feel so
*  hurt when my partner doesn't pick me up at the airport? You know? So then we start looking at
*  what happened to our lives, and we find the answers in our history. And then it's a matter of letting
*  go of those patterns. And that takes some kind of work, usually therapy or some kind of spiritual
*  work or psychological work, some kind of different way of taking care of ourselves.
*  Usually it takes some inquiry, what I call a compassionate inquiry, of looking at ourselves
*  with real curiosity. What is causing me to live the way I'm living, and why is it not working for me?
*  Gabor Monte, your book comes out at an extraordinary time, given your topic. And I know it took you
*  years to write, but now in the pandemic, you have, according to the CDC, hospitals reported a 24%
*  increase in mental health emergencies for children between the ages of, what, 5 to 11.
*  And the issue of mental health overall, so critical at this point. You talk a lot also
*  about loneliness. But can you start by talking about this mental health crisis among youth
*  and the escalating suicide?
*  Yes. So the New York Times, about three weeks ago, as we speak now, had a front-page article
*  in their Sunday edition about a teenager who was on 10 different psychiatric medications.
*  Can you imagine? 10 different psychiatric medications. And there's been articles in
*  the New Yorker and the New York Times within the last four or five months about the rising
*  tide of childhood suicides. There is a vast increase in the number of children being diagnosed with ADHD,
*  attention deficit, hyperactive disorder, with anxiety, depression,
*  self-cutting, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and so on. Now, we can make two assumptions.
*  Either there's some accidental, totally unexplainable,
*  rise in childhood pathology that has no specific reason whatsoever for its instigation,
*  or we can recognize that we live in a toxic culture that by its very nature affects children
*  development in such unhealthy ways that children are increasingly mentally unbalanced and desperate
*  to the extent that they're cutting themselves and even trying to kill themselves. So we have
*  to look for those conditions, not in the individual mind or brain or personality of the child or youth.
*  We have to look at them into social conditions that drive children in those directions.
*  And unfortunately, in a public conversation around it, it's all about the pathology and how to treat
*  it, and it's not about the social-cultural causes that are driving children in those desperate
*  directions. So can you talk about how you view this and how this, not just this country,
*  the world can heal, especially focusing on youth? Well, we need to begin right at the beginning,
*  and the beginning is actually in the womb. Now, we already know from multiple, multiple studies,
*  not even controversial, that the more stress there is on pregnant women, the greater the impact,
*  even decades later, on the well-being of the infant. So how are we looking after pregnant women?
*  The average physician—I mean, I was trained as a medical doctor. To this day, the average physician,
*  when they're trained in prenatal care, they're not trained to ask about the woman's emotional
*  states. They're not trained to ask about, how are you doing? How's your relationship? How's
*  your work stress? What can we do to support you? We only look after the body, and we separate the
*  mind from the body. We know that stresses on the woman can already have an impact on the infant.
*  Then there's our birth practices. In North America now, the caesarian section rate is
*  approaching 40 percent. Now, modern obstetrics is miraculous in its capacity to save lives,
*  and it should be applied about 10 to 15 percent of cases for the benefit of the infant or the mother.
*  But the 40 percent C-section rate and the mechanization of birth—natural birth, as
*  evolved by nature, was designed to produce a bonding experience for mother and infant,
*  including the release of bonding chemicals that will bring them together for a lifelong
*  relationship. We'll memedicalize birth. We interfere with it. We mechanize it. We create
*  fear around it. We're actually interfering with the mother-child bond on which the child's
*  healthy development develops. Then, in the United States, 25 percent of women have to go back to
*  work within two weeks of giving birth. Now, nature would have that mom be with the child for at least
*  nine months, usually longer if you look at it historically. 25 percent of women having to go
*  back to work for economic reasons, for lack of social support, amounts to a massive abandonment
*  of infants, because that's how the infants experience it. That's the only way they can
*  interpret it. Just the way I interpreted it, my mother's giving me to a stranger as an abandonment.
*  Then there is the child-rearing practices that I've already mentioned of not picking up children
*  when they're crying, of parents being so stressed that their stresses are absorbed by the infant,
*  that the parent's economic, racial, social anxieties, relational anxieties, their own
*  unresolved trauma, are absorbed by the infants. Then there's parenting practices that focus on
*  trying to control the child's behavior without in any way trying to meet the child's needs.
*  The human child is born with certain needs for unconditional loving acceptance, for being held,
*  for the capacity to experience all their emotions with parental support. In this society,
*  those needs are denied over and over and over again, and most of our children spend most of
*  their time away from their parents, so they lose the connection with the parent. Do we wonder then
*  that the child's circuits of anxiety and panic in the brain are activated and extra over-activated?
*  These are natural consequences of an unnatural culture.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH AL-ALI, M.D. Doctor Mate, could you elaborate on what you've been talking about now,
*  namely the relationship between individual—the effects of an individual and social trauma? You
*  said in a recent interview, quote, being left with an emptiness and insatiable craving creates
*  addiction in the personal sense and capitalism in the social sense, and both these are taken
*  to be coping mechanisms for the experience of trauma, if you could explain.
*  NERMEEN SHAIKH AL-ALI, M.D. Doctor Mate, well, let me give you a more simple—I will answer
*  that question, but let me give you first a simpler example of social trauma and illness.
*  So it's been well shown that the more experiences of racism a black American woman has to endure,
*  the greater her risk for asthma. In other words, the constriction of her airways and the inflammation
*  of her airways are the physiological product of a social malaise. Now, who's got the pathology here,
*  society or the individual? Can we even make a separation between the two?
*  We know that if you look at the markers of aging, various biological markers of aging,
*  they are much more advanced in black people of the same age as their Caucasian cohorts,
*  simply because of racism, because social stress and trauma translate into the physiology of the
*  individual. You can't separate the mind from the body, and you cannot separate the individual from
*  the environment. In Canada, where I live, an indigenous woman—by the way, indigenous people
*  used to have no autoimmune disease whatsoever prior to colonization. Today, an indigenous woman
*  in Canada exists times the risk, six times the risk of rheumatoid arthritis. And the same thing
*  is true in the United States, by the way, that autoimmune disease strikes especially women and
*  especially women of color at much higher rates. These reasons have nothing to do with genetics
*  and everything to do with social trauma. Now, the emptiness that you refer to in a society that tells
*  you that you're not enough, that you're not good enough, that you don't look good enough,
*  that you don't have enough, that you don't own enough, that you haven't attained enough—creating
*  this sense of emptiness is the fuel that runs the consumer society, where it never is enough. You
*  always have to have more and more. You have to attain more and more, obtain more and more.
*  So, basically, it's a highly addictive culture that feeds off people's addiction to drive its
*  profits, and they do so quite deliberately. When it comes to the food industry, for example,
*  you probably remember this book a few years ago, Salt, Sugar and Fat, where the food companies
*  very deliberately try to identify, using sophisticated neuroscience, the sweet spot,
*  the bliss spot, that when you have the right combination of salt, sugar and fat in your junk
*  food, that's what gets people addicted. So that the digital companies
*  employ what's called neuromarketing. They try and find what's the best way to excite the circuits
*  in the brain of the customer that gets most addicted in order to get them hooked on their
*  products. What we're looking at here is the mass engineering of addiction. And we're not talking
*  conspiracy theory. This is conspiracy reality. That's how it works. But, of course, from the
*  point of view of profit, it works, because people are going to buy junk foods that are going to kill
*  them or make them ill. But those companies don't care. They just want—they just want—it's not
*  that they're trying to kill you, as I say in one chapter of the book. They just don't care if you die,
*  because what really matters is profits. So this society runs on people's sense of
*  deficient emptiness, where more and more is what they think is needed to fill that
*  hole inside themselves. Dr. Gabor Mate, part of the power of the myth of normal, your book,
*  is the examples that you use, particular people, especially women who are sick or chronically ill.
*  Some of them you name, like Vee, formerly known as Eve Ensler. You have a whole section talking
*  about her, and if you can talk about how she fits into this idea of healing from trauma.
*  To other people, give us some case studies.
*  Dr. Gabor Mate, part of the power of the myth of normal, your book, is the examples that you use,
*  particularly women who are sick or chronically ill. Sure. Well, Vee, in her astonishing book,
*  which I think you've discussed on your program, In the Body of the World,
*  where she describes her near death and then recovery from stage three and four uterine cancer,
*  she asked herself at some point, do I have rape cancer? Because her history was that she was
*  chronically, for years, sexually and physically and emotionally abused by her father.
*  Now, we know from multiple studies that the more trauma, the more abuse you suffered as a child,
*  the greater the risk for atumia disease or malignancy later on.
*  So, for example, young girls sexually abused have a much higher rate of endometriosis,
*  which is a risk factor for uterine cancer. We also know from a recent study from Harvard
*  that the more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder a woman has, the greater the risk for
*  ovarian cancer. So when Eve asks, do I have rape cancer? The answer is very much yes. She's got
*  rape cancer. And then she goes through this incredible process of healing, which involved
*  the best services, not always delivered in the best way, but certainly astonishing
*  achievements of modern medicine that really helped save her life. But Eve also underwent
*  a personal transformation, where she—what happens when you're traumatized, and Vee talks about this,
*  is you get disconnected from your body. You get disconnected from your body,
*  because when you're a child being abused by your father, it's too painful to be in your body,
*  so you disconnect. And all of a sudden, Vee has this massive surgery, and she wakes up with
*  all kinds of lymph nodes and organs removed from her body and tubes in and out of her body,
*  but she's back in her body, and she finds this exhilarating. So that loss of connection to the
*  body is one aspect of trauma. The reconnection that happened in Vee's case, not just because of the
*  medical treatment that she received, but because of the powerful emotional and spiritual support
*  that she received and that she opened herself to, resulted in a complete transformation of her
*  personality and her relationship to herself. The other thing that Vee has done is she became a
*  powerful activist, and that social engagement, which connects her to people and has given such
*  deep meaning to her life and her activity. That's a powerful healing modality as well,
*  and I talk about that in the book, and Vee is such a noble and inspiring example of that.
*  And in the book, I give many examples of people who are faced with serious diagnoses,
*  written off by Western medicine, but they have a powerful transformation in their relationship
*  to themselves. They regain that connection to themselves, that they lost their results of trauma,
*  and as a result, their illness takes very surprising trajectories, sometimes miraculous.
*  And so, in the book, I talk about women with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis,
*  who are told that you've got this disease for the rest of your life and it's just a physical
*  disease, nothing we can do about it. When they realize that both the rheumatoid arthritis and
*  the multiple sclerosis have to do with trauma and stress, for which, by the way, there's all kinds
*  of research evidence completely ignored in medical practice, or when they realize that how
*  they live their lives, that the disease is not an accident, the disease is a manifestation of how
*  they live their lives informed by their unresolved trauma, when they deal with the trauma and they
*  develop a different relationship to themselves, all of a sudden, the disease lightens up for them,
*  as you expect it would once you realize that the mind and body are inseparable. And by the way,
*  I'm not the only one who writes about this. There's been researchers from Harvard and elsewhere
*  who have documented similar cases. The point we're all making is that the mind and body is
*  inseparable, the individual is inseparable from the environment, and so that when you look at the
*  whole person and their whole environment and the whole context, we have powerful modalities of
*  healing available to us that Western medicine, unfortunately, seems unaware of.
*  And, Dr. Matei, if you could also talk about another aspect, another way in which
*  society might exacerbate individual trauma, you talk in the book, you're critical in the book,
*  about this idea that people should simply push through it, this idea of resilience.
*  What are the effects of that orientation towards trauma? And if you could link it
*  also with what you've just said about the way in which the medical establishment
*  and Western medicine understands the question of psychic wounds.
*  The average medical student—how the medical system deals with trauma is that it doesn't.
*  The average medical student does not get a single lecture on the relationship between trauma and
*  physical or mental illness, despite the voluminously documented evidence. So there's
*  this huge gap between our science and what we practice, so that so many physicians have to
*  figure this out after they leave medical school. They have to figure it out on their own, because
*  nothing in their training prepared them for it. As a matter of fact, their own training is often
*  so traumatic in itself, and their own traumas are not dealt with, that they're just not prepared
*  to deal with the traumas of their patients. It's just a subject that's almost completely ignored
*  across the practice of medicine. Now, in terms of the get over it and resilience aspect,
*  there's a beautiful story or truth that my friend Dr. Louis Mel Medrona, who's a Lakota Sioux
*  background psychiatrist and physician, and Louis Mel Medrona told me, and he's an author as well,
*  and he told me that in the Lakota tradition, when somebody gets ill, the community says,
*  thank you. Your illness represents some dysfunction in our whole community,
*  because we're not separate. Your body is not separate from your mind, and your mind is not
*  separate from the rest of our minds. We co-create each other. So your illness represents some
*  dysfunction, some imbalance in our whole community. So your healing is our healing.
*  How can we support you? That's the traditional, indigenous way of looking at human beings, which,
*  modern science, by the way, is more than amply validated, but which modern medicine still
*  ignores. So now, the onus is not just on this individual to get over it. It's actually
*  resilience, as seen as a communal endeavor and as a communal attribute. And when you isolate people,
*  atomize them, you make them feel guilty or weak for their illness and tell them to get over their
*  trauma, you're just shaming them more, you're isolating them more, and you're entrenching them more
*  in the traumatic imprint. What people need is community, contact, compassion, safety.
*  That's what allows people to work through their traumas. And unfortunately, that's not readily available.
*  There's this amazing figure out from the National Center for Health Statistics revealing that U.S. life
*  expectancy fell from 79 years old in 2019 to 76 in 2021, the largest two-year decline
*  in almost a century. With advances in modern medicine, it's astounding, but maybe not
*  astounding when you look at the kind of health system we have in this country that increases the
*  disparities between those who have wealth and those who don't, when you look at, you know, health
*  and a capitalist system. I was wondering if you could comment on that, Dr. Rattay.
*  Dr. Rattay Well, the impact of inequality has been studied by Sir Michael Marmot,
*  who is a British epidemiologist and he was former head of the World Medical Association, and
*  they talk about a social gradient, that the lower social class you are, the greater the risk to your
*  health. And this has been known for decades. Now, these decline in the U.S. national life expectancy,
*  you can look upon it again as sort of mysterious individual pathology, or you can actually look at
*  the social conditions that drive it. And much of that is due to the hollowing out of the American
*  industrial heartland due to globalization and the loss of meaning and purpose and meaningful
*  employment in people's lives. This is what has been called in the United States deaths of despair.
*  So many of these deaths are due to suicide and to drug overdoses and to alcoholism. And suicide
*  and drug overdoses and alcoholism are direct outcomes of a society that deprives people of
*  meaning and belonging, a sense of connection, a sense of value, a sense of purpose. So again,
*  we can look upon these manifestations as individual pathology, which yields no explanation
*  whatsoever, or we can see them as the outcomes of a toxic culture. You experience the same thing in
*  the former Soviet Union, when the—with the collapse of the former Soviet Union, loss of jobs,
*  loss of employment, loss of meaning and purpose, that the life expectancy of men plummeted
*  drastically within a few years. Now we're seeing the same phenomenon in the United States.
*  The title of your book, Dr. Gabor Maté, is The Myth of Normal, Trauma, Illness and Healing in a
*  Toxic Culture. So why don't we end with that question of healing, both individually and as a
*  society? Yes. So healing, again, if you look at word origins, which I often do, comes to my word
*  for wholeness. So healing actually is a movement towards our wholeness. Now, if trauma is a split
*  from ourselves, for example, a split from our bodies, as in the case of V, who had to disconnect
*  from her body to survive her childhood, then healing is that reconnection with ourselves.
*  And that—and if trauma is not what the terrible things that happen to us, but trauma is the wound
*  that we sustained and are carrying, that's a very positive message, because it means that that wound
*  can be healed at any time. You see, if the trauma is what happened to me now 77 years ago, that my
*  mother gave me to a stranger, that will never not have happened. But if the trauma is what I made it
*  mean, the wound that I sustained, that I wasn't a lovable, worthwhile human being, that wound can be
*  healed at any moment in all of us. So the last and longest section of the book explores what we call
*  pathways to healing or pathways to wholeness. That's the meaning of healing. There are many different
*  pathways. There's no one-size-fits-for-all. It needs to begin with the recognition that how are we
*  living and how we are relating to ourselves and others is not healthy. It may be the norm in this
*  culture, but it's neither healthy or natural, and there are better ways. And the same thing is true
*  for our culture. And the essential first step is what I call being disillusioned. Now, people
*  usually think of disillusionment as discouraging and somehow negative. No. Would we rather be
*  illusioned or disillusioned? Would we rather see the world through rose-colored glasses,
*  not seeing what's in front of us? Or would we rather deal with reality the way it is? In the
*  final chapter, I quote James Baldwin, the great, great James Baldwin, who said that,
*  not everything that's faced can be healed, but nothing that's not faced can be healed.
