# “Divide and Rule”: How Israel Helped Start Hamas to Weaken Palestinian Hopes for Statehood
**Democracy Now!:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrvEJ3IdeY)
*  The death toll in Gaza from Israel's 14-day bombardment has topped 4,100, as Israel continues
*  to block food, water and fuel from entering the besieged territory.
*  Over 13,000 Palestinians have been injured over the past two weeks.
*  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres traveled today to the Egyptian side of the Ra'fa border
*  crossing to Gaza to demand humanitarian aid convoys be allowed entry.
*  These trucks are not just trucks.
*  They are a lifeline.
*  They are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza.
*  Guterres said the U.N. is actively engaging with Israel and Egypt to get the aid trucks
*  into Gaza.
*  The BBC is reporting Hamas has offered to release some of the hostages it seized during
*  its attack on October 7th in exchange for a ceasefire, but Israel has rejected the deal.
*  Earlier today, the Israeli military said it believes the majority of the 200 hostages
*  seized are still alive.
*  Israel's defense minister hinted Thursday a ground invasion of Gaza is imminent, telling
*  troops they will soon see Gaza, quote, from inside.
*  Israel's ramping up its crackdown on the occupied West Bank.
*  forces killed 13 Palestinians in a raid on the North Shams refugee camp near the city
*  of Tolkham.
*  In recent days, Israel has also detained 750 Palestinians, including lawmakers and journalists.
*  On Thursday night, President Biden gave a primetime speech from the Oval Office calling
*  for Congress to approve $14 billion for Israel, another $60 billion for Ukraine and some for
*  Taiwan.
*  This comes as HuffPoach is reporting there is a quote mutiny brewing inside the State
*  Department over Biden's policy on Israel.
*  Joining us now in New York is Tarek Baconi, Palestinian analyst and writer, president
*  of the board of al-Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network, and former senior analyst for
*  the International Crisis Group on Israel-Palestine.
*  His recent piece for the New York Review is headlined, Gaza Without Pretenses.
*  For years, Israel and Hamas maintained an unstable equilibrium that kept the Gaza Strip
*  contained, but it was always likely to be temporary.
*  Tarek is author of the book Hamas Contained, The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance.
*  Tarek, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  Before we go to the history of Hamas, I wanted to ask you about the current situation, the
*  latest that we hear.
*  The looks like a ground invasion is imminent.
*  The RAF border is still closed, although there had been a deal to allow in 20 trucks of aid
*  coming from Egypt into Gaza, though those inside, medical groups are saying even 100
*  trucks a day wouldn't quite deal with the crisis and the need inside.
*  Well, Amy, yes, the situation in the Gaza Strip is quite dire.
*  What we see today is really a continuation of efforts by Israel to place the Gaza Strip
*  under a complete blockade, and this has been ongoing for about 16 years now.
*  And then after the offensive by Hamas on the 7th of October, Israel placed the Gaza Strip
*  under what it called a total siege.
*  What this means is that it's prevented the entry of water, fuel, electricity and medicine
*  into the Gaza Strip.
*  Now, this is a form of collective punishment.
*  We have to understand that Gaza Strip has about 2.3 million Palestinians.
*  About two-thirds of them are refugees from homes in what is now Israel, and about half
*  of that are minors and children.
*  This is a form of collective punishment and is essentially reliant on a total dehumanization
*  of Palestinians in Gaza.
*  What we're seeing happening at the moment is that humanitarian aid is being politicized,
*  that humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Gaza is linked to political goals, and
*  any form of effort to try to de-escalate is being blocked by the U.S.
*  The fact that the U.S. vetoed the UN Security Council resolution yesterday is an indication
*  of its willingness to allow Israel to continue both its bombardment of the Gaza Strip as
*  well as its strangulation of Gaza's civilian population through the blocking of entry of
*  humanitarian aid.
*  Can you explain what that resolution was that the U.S. rejected?
*  Well, it was a resolution that was tabled by Brazil, and it called for an immediate
*  de-escalation and a ceasefire.
*  It was a humanitarian ceasefire, which meant that the bombardment from the Israeli authorities
*  would have to cease and allow for humanitarian aid to come into the Gaza Strip and for the
*  restrictions to be eased.
*  However, we see that this continues to, first of all, the U.S. blocked the resolution, and
*  then when there were agreements to have, as you said, 20 truckloads to enter the Gaza
*  Strip, which is far less than the minimum that would be required to sustain Gaza's civilian
*  population, there are still obstacles to the entry of those trucks.
*  We also have to understand that Gaza's population has been forced by Israeli authorities to
*  evacuate the majority of the northern parts of the Strip.
*  This has resulted in a forced displacement of about one, or the orders was for the forced
*  displacement of 1.1 million Palestinians.
*  Now, the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated strips of land in the world.
*  Any form of evacuation is really impossible.
*  There's nowhere for Palestinians to leave.
*  What that means is that any kind of bombardment that the Israeli authorities are carrying
*  out in the Gaza Strip are killing Palestinians in their thousands.
*  And unlike in previous military assaults, here Israel is actually quite explicit about
*  wanting to target civilian infrastructure, ambulances, health care centers, clinics,
*  and the bombing is indiscriminate, as Palestinians in Gaza are reporting by intent.
*  This is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking Tuesday about Hamas.
*  This is part of an axis of evil of Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas.
*  Their goal, open goal, is to eradicate the state of Israel.
*  The open goal of Hamas is to kill as many Jews as they could, and the only difference
*  is they would have killed every last one of us, murdered every last one of us.
*  If they could, they just don't have the capacity, but they murdered an extraordinary 1,300
*  civilians, which in American terms is like many, many, many 9-11s.
*  That's Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Tarek Baconi, you wrote the book Hamas Contained.
*  Can you respond?
*  Well, I mean, this language that the Israelis and the American officials have been using
*  to demonize Hamas has been entirely based in the effort to depoliticize the Palestinian
*  and to present any form of armed resistance against what is a violent apartheid regime
*  as a form of terrorism.
*  The impact of this is really to try to give Israel a carte blanche, to continue dealing
*  with the question of Palestine, with the quest by the Palestinian people to gain their inalienable
*  rights through force and through a security doctrine.
*  The President Biden's linking of the attack that happened on 7th October to 9-11 is really
*  a carte blanche for Israel to do what it wants to in the Gaza Strip.
*  And it's an affirmation that all the lessons that have been learned after Israel's, after
*  America's own 9-11 have really been lost.
*  Now, this isn't, this language isn't new.
*  Successive Israeli governments have linked Palestinian resistance generally and Hamas
*  specifically to 9-11 and to terrorism and has used that link in order to reinforce and
*  re-entrench its occupation.
*  What we have to understand here is that this isn't an effort to try to quell, to destroy
*  Hamas specifically.
*  This is an effort to pursue an ethnic cleansing campaign in the Gaza Strip and beyond the
*  Gaza Strip as we see the violence rising in the West Bank.
*  The effort to link Hamas's attack to 9-11 is really to give cover to pursue genocidal
*  tendencies that the Israeli political establishment has articulated long before October 7th.
*  So, the Israeli military, also Biden, very much bonded, sort of bound to this analysis
*  as well, talks about the Hamas attack on October 7th, killing over 1,300 Israelis.
*  Over 200 are being held by Hamas.
*  Looks like the majority of them, according to the Israeli government, are still alive.
*  The Israeli government says Hamas uses civilians as human shields.
*  And in this comment of the Israeli military saying they've given a green light to move
*  into Gaza whenever it's ready, the economy minister near Barakat said in an interview
*  with ABC News, concerns over hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying
*  the country.
*  So, Hamas, were you surprised by the October 7th attack?
*  And talk about what Israel is saying right now and, of course, what's happening in
*  Gaza.
*  Well, the 7th of October attack was certainly surprising for someone like myself, who's
*  been studying Hamas for a long time, but I imagine also for many Palestinians in the
*  Gaza Strip, as well as probably for Hamas's leadership.
*  It was surprising not in its timing, obviously, and not in the offensive, the nature of the
*  offensive and how it took place, but it was surprising mostly in the scale of it and the
*  ability of Hamas to really penetrate into Israeli-controlled territory around the Gaza
*  Strip and to spend the length of time that fighters, Hamas and otherwise, were able to
*  spend in Israeli towns.
*  You have to understand that for many Palestinians and more broadly, there's a myth of an Israeli
*  invincibility, that Israel is impenetrable, at least from the Gaza Strip, and that its
*  army is unparalleled.
*  And that expectation was probably in the minds of Hamas's leadership when they were planning
*  and staging this attack.
*  And instead of any form of effective defense on the Israeli side, what we saw was a complete
*  shattering of this illusion.
*  We saw the reality that actually Israel's army is not invincible and that the blockade
*  that is placed around the Gaza Strip is perfectly penetrable and that Hamas was able to overturn
*  Israel's myth of invincibility very, very quickly.
*  Now, the scale of the attack and the number of hostages that Hamas was able to capture
*  and take back into the Gaza Strip probably exceeded its expectations, which also meant
*  that the retaliation that we now see is also probably far worse than Hamas might have anticipated.
*  Now, that's not to say that Hamas didn't anticipate some form of retaliation, because that has
*  always been, at least in the past 16 years, the equilibrium between Hamas and Israel,
*  that Hamas would try to pressure Israel through rockets or otherwise to lift or ease restrictions
*  on the blockade, because the blockade itself is a form of violence that's triangulating
*  2 million Palestinians in Gaza.
*  And Israel would respond with disproportionate military force, military force that would
*  result in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
*  Now, the expectation has always been from the Israeli side that this situation is tenable,
*  that it can be sustained, and it adopted what it called the military doctrine of mowing
*  the lawn, that it would do this every few years, and then that this equilibrium would
*  be sustained indefinitely.
*  What we saw on the 7th of October was Hamas overturning that equilibrium and saying, actually,
*  you cannot have any kind of calm or security for your citizens as long as your boot remains
*  on our necks.
*  The Palestinians will not acquiesce to their imprisonment silently.
*  So that equilibrium has now shattered.
*  I wanted to ask you if you could talk about Israel's involvement in Hamas gaining power.
*  In 2009, Avner Kohn, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for over
*  20 years, told The Wall Street Journal, quote,
*  "'Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel's creation.'"
*  Another former Israeli official, Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, said he was given a
*  budget to help finance Islamist movements in Gaza to counter Yasser Arafat and his
*  Fatah movement.
*  Another former Israeli military official, David Hachem, said, quote,
*  "'When I look back at the chain of events, I think we made a mistake, but at the time
*  nobody thought about the possible results.'"
*  Your response, Tarek Balkhoni?
*  Well, the origins of that is really Hamas.
*  Hamas emerged as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood chapter in the Gaza Strip.
*  And the Muslim Brotherhood chapter was not a political party.
*  It was a social party.
*  And its operations in the Gaza Strip and throughout the Palestinian territories were actually
*  granted licenses by Israeli occupying forces at the time.
*  So there was a license for the Muslim Brotherhood chapter to operate openly in the Gaza Strip.
*  When Hamas was established in 1987 and became a political party and a military party that
*  was engaged in active resistance against Israel's occupation, the policies within the Israeli
*  government shifted.
*  And obviously it became less open to allowing Hamas to function.
*  However, that did not deter Israeli authorities from encouraging and promoting divide-and-rule
*  tactics between the Islamist nationalist movement, Hamas, and secular nationalism around
*  Fatah.
*  And this has always been a tactic that the colonial forces have used globally.
*  And obviously Israeli colonialism is no different.
*  So it has directly and implicitly attempted divide-and-rule policies.
*  This really turned and came to a head in 2007 when Hamas, after winning democratic elections
*  in 2006, rose to power.
*  And the Israeli authorities, along with the U.S., attempted to initiate a regime change
*  operation, which facilitated a civil war between Hamas and Fatah and allowed Hamas to take
*  over the Gaza Strip.
*  Since then, Israeli authorities have actively embraced the idea that Hamas would be accepted
*  as a governing authority in the Gaza Strip.
*  Now, part of the calculus in that is because of Gaza's two million Palestinians.
*  This is a demographic issue.
*  Israel wanted to sever the Gaza Strip from the rest of historic Palestine in order to
*  reinforce its claim that it's a Jewish-majority state.
*  By getting rid of two million Palestinians, two-thirds of whom are refugees demanding
*  return, Israel can claim to be both a Jewish state and a democracy and restructure what
*  is its apartheid regime.
*  Now, in order to do that, it acquiesced to maintaining Hamas in governance, and it claimed
*  that it placed a blockade around the Gaza Strip because Hamas was in power.
*  And obviously, this was bought in the international community using what we were just talking
*  about, the idea that Hamas is a terrorist organization, axis of evil, and therefore
*  that this blockade makes sense.
*  What policymakers don't understand is that Israel has engaged in blockades around the
*  Gaza Strip and attempted to get rid of the population in the Gaza Strip long before Hamas
*  was even established as a party.
*  But with Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip, this created a perfect fig leaf for Israel
*  to maintain the Gaza Strip as a separate strip of land.
*  And to do that, it had to acquiesce and in some ways even enable Hamas to maintain its
*  position as a governing authority there.
*  And this also further reinforced its efforts to try to maintain division among the Palestinian
*  leadership and play divide-and-rule policies between the PA and Hamas.
*  What would you like to see happen, Tarek, right now?
*  It looks like Israel is on the verge of a ground invasion of Gaza.
*  What do you think needs to happen?
*  Well, the most immediate need right now is for a de-escalation.
*  World leaders, and specifically the U.S. and the Biden administration, need to understand
*  that this is not a retaliation by Israel towards Hamas.
*  What we are seeing now is the effort by Israel to pursue an ethnic cleansing campaign and
*  to continue the Nakba, which began in 1948 and which has been ongoing since, in fits
*  and starts here and there.
*  What we're seeing is a massive rupture in the daily ethnic cleansing that Israeli authorities
*  are going, are implementing against the Palestinians in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, as
*  well as in the Gaza Strip.
*  And now we're seeing that rupture take the ethnic cleansing campaign from a daily, continual
*  basis into a significantly more focused attempt at getting rid of millions of Palestinians.
*  We need to de-escalate and we need to ensure that humanitarian aid comes into the Gaza
*  Strip because this is impacting Gaza's civilian population.
*  This is a starting step.
*  The next step needs to be an acknowledgement that Israel is an apartheid regime that is
*  maintaining a system of domination against millions of Palestinians.
*  It's the only sovereign power in the land of historic Palestine and it allows rights
*  only to Israeli Jewish citizens, not to Palestinians.
*  What happened on October 7th is a testament to the fact that that reality cannot go on.
*  And that overturns the assumption that the U.S. administration, as well as regional powers,
*  have always had, which is that Israel can continue to act with impunity without any
*  cost to its citizens.
*  And I believe we cannot go back to that paradigm anymore.
*  Tarik Bakoni, I want to thank you very much for being with us.
