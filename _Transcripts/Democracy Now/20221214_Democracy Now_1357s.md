# Indict Us Too: Daniel Ellsberg & Cryptome's John Young Demand US Drop Charges Against Julian Assange
**Democracy Now!:** [December 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wln56odE7oo)
*  Pressure is growing on President Biden to drop charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian
*  Assange, who's been jailed in Britain since his arrest in April of 2019.
*  The Biden administration is asking the U.K.
*  government to extradite him to the U.S., where he faces up to 175 years in prison on espionage
*  and hacking charges if he's found guilty at trial.
*  WikiLeaks says Assange could be extradited within weeks.
*  Assange was first arrested 12 years ago this month, on December 7, 2010.
*  After a period under house arrest, he lived in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where
*  he had political asylum from 2012 to 2019.
*  Five major news organizations, including The New York Times, which once partnered with
*  WikiLeaks, recently called on the Biden administration to drop charges against Assange, writing,
*  This indictment sets a dangerous precedent and threatens to undermine America's First
*  Amendment and the freedom of the press."
*  The letter goes on to say publishing is not a crime.
*  The letter was signed by The New York Times, The Guardian in Britain, Le Monde in France,
*  Der Spiegel in Germany and El País in Spain.
*  Meanwhile, Pentagon papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg recently revealed he was in possession
*  of confidential documents containing evidence of U.S. war crimes leaked by former military
*  analyst Chelsea Manning and given to him as backup by WikiLeaks.
*  In a recent message to President Biden and the Justice Department, Ellsberg wrote on
*  Twitter, quote,
*  The founder of the website Cryptome.org has also written to the Justice Department asking
*  to be indicted as well.
*  Cryptome's founder, John Young, says he should be added as a co-defendant in the prosecution
*  of Assange because he published some of the same leaked government documents at the center
*  of the U.S. case against Assange.
*  Cryptome is a website that began in 1996 and is seen by many as a precursor to WikiLeaks.
*  Young also helped Assange start WikiLeaks in 2006.
*  While Assange faces 175 years in U.S. prison if he's extradited and convicted, the U.S.
*  government has never moved to prosecute Young, who says he published the unredacted State
*  Department cables two days prior to WikiLeaks.
*  The U.S. government has never even asked Young to remove the documents.
*  Well, today, in a Democracy Now! exclusive, we're joined by both Pentagon papers whistleblower
*  Dan Ellsberg in Berkeley, California, and Cryptome's John Young here in New York.
*  We welcome you both to Democracy Now!, Dan Ellsberg.
*  Let's begin with you.
*  Why don't you lay out what you're asking the Justice Department to do?
*  I'm asking them to look closely at the charges they have brought against—actually past
*  whistleblowers, all past—and Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange, potentially against me
*  and John Young.
*  Because as lawyers said at the time of my first trial back in 1971, Melville Nimr, the
*  leading scholar of law of information at that point, said that if the Espionage Act were
*  against someone who had done what I had admittedly done, copy and distribute 7,000 pages of top
*  secret documents, that law was unconstitutional.
*  And that's been true ever since.
*  It's unconstitutional, used against sources, as it has been done several dozen times, especially
*  in this century under Presidents Obama and Trump and now Biden.
*  It's also unconstitutional, used against journalists.
*  That's blatantly unconstitutional.
*  They never tried it, even under President Obama when President Biden was vice president.
*  They backed off because of the clear unconstitutionalality under the First Amendment,
*  which says no law should be passed abridging freedom of the press.
*  And finally, by raising this constitutional issue that I focus on in particular, I'm showing that
*  the law can be used absurdly, at least absurdly broadly, against someone like me who admittedly
*  retained and failed to deliver.
*  These are the words of 18 USC 793 paragraph E.
*  And I know that so well as a non-lawyer, I'm a defendant, because I was the first person
*  charged with that for giving information to the public.
*  So I am as guilty in their eyes as Assange.
*  How come they haven't come after me for this?
*  I did much the same a year ago and raised this challenge.
*  If at last the media, who have been derelict in informing themselves on a law which was
*  always potentially there to indict them, if they do this and really raise the issue of the
*  necessity to abandon or strongly amend the Espionage Act so as to exclude journalists
*  and exclude whistleblowers who are trying to inform the American public, if they want
*  to continue as they are, they can come after me, which means anyone who retains a copy
*  of the New York Times, which has the word classified in it, and who fails to turn over
*  that copy to authorities authorized to receive it, mail it in to the Justice Department,
*  I guess, is as guilty as I am under the plain language of that act.
*  A British-type official secrets act is barred from America after our revolution by the First
*  Amendment to the United States, freedom of the press.
*  They don't have that.
*  Since my prosecution, the Justice Department has been using the Espionage Act,
*  intended obviously for entirely different reasons, spies who secretly give information
*  to America's enemies, especially in wartime.
*  They've been using it as if it were an official secrets act.
*  If they succeed with Julian Assange in extraditing him, which Biden could stop
*  tomorrow and should, if they succeed in that, prosecute him and convict him,
*  we will not have the First Amendment.
*  It's as if we didn't fight a war of independence, actually, with respect to anything
*  they regarded as related to national defense.
*  Free speech is pretty much out the door.
*  And I want to raise the issue that the act even promotes the possibility of prosecuting
*  people like me, who do not even publish—I was a backup for Julian Assange,
*  didn't have to publish—but can get anybody who handles that material, any secretary at
*  the newspaper and any reader of The New York Times.
*  John Young, Dan Ellsberg is perhaps the most famous whistleblower in the world in
*  releasing the Pentagon Papers. You are not as well known.
*  You founded Cryptome.org back in the 90s. Explain why you are saying,
*  if Julian Assange is guilty, you should be jailed as well.
*  I'm pretty clear in looking at the indictment of Julian Assange and the 18 citations at
*  each charge. Or as I could tell, all those apply to me and Cryptome.
*  We've been doing this now since 1996. We publish classified information, secret information
*  from other countries within the United States. And so I'm unclear why, if they're charging him,
*  why they've never charged someone like us. By the way, we're only one of dozens of people who
*  are putting out this kind of information from the Federation of American Scientists to the
*  National Security Archive. This has been going on there quite a long while.
*  So our sense is that they're trying to use Assange as an example to frighten people.
*  That to me is selective vindication against him. And he should not face this alone.
*  I think all of those of us who are doing similar kind of work to serve the public rather than the
*  government should do more than just protest. I think we've got to raise more hell and take
*  more legal action and publish more. And as our obligation as citizens,
*  I think intelligence agencies are completely out of control. National security people are
*  completely out of control. They're actually trying to use Assange as a threat against everyone else,
*  not only in the U.S., but around the world. And this to us seems to be anti-democratic.
*  And we'd like to help combat that by sharing the responsibility that Mr. Ellsberg and
*  the security union Assange is facing. And we hope others will step up as well.
*  By the way, we're not publishers. We're private citizens practicing architects. And so we are not
*  doing anything more than exerting our constitutional rights under the First Amendment.
*  So this accusation against Assange would be illegal against an American citizen.
*  So we think it's selective prosecution and it should cease.
*  On Monday, you filed this motion against the U.S. government for violating your
*  constitutional rights to provide unlimited documents to the public.
*  Now, specifically in the case of Julian Assange, you say you published at Cryptome.org
*  two days before WikiLeaks did, State Department cables explain you're saying the same thing
*  that WikiLeaks revealed, and so you are guilty of the same crime.
*  Yes, except we don't see that as a crime. It's just revelation of privilege information.
*  We don't see it as criminal. We see it as free speech. And it's all the citizen has to work with
*  if they're not part of the press is to speak up and take responsibility for their abuse.
*  So that's why we did it. It said it was available,
*  but it was worthwhile for the public to know. It's been there now for 12 years,
*  hundreds of downloads. No complaint from the U.S. government against us.
*  I wanted to ask you, John Young, the U.K. Crown Prosecution Service
*  responded to your request to be included as a co-defendant. What did they say?
*  They said that the prosecution service is not the one to take this up with. They said it's the U.S.
*  government which is handling this, and they are just a minor party to it. So they basically
*  disavowed responsibility for this vindictive attack on Julian Assange, which I thought was
*  interesting. So they're actually acting as a hand servant to the U.S. government, is what they're
*  saying. Dan Ellsberg, if Julian Assange were extradited, he would go to trial here. If
*  convicted, he faces up to 175 years in prison. Talk about what you think that trial would look like.
*  I presume that his lawyers would begin, would raise the constitutional issue right at the beginning.
*  Here's something that I think has never gone public, but I've been well aware of it.
*  The legal aide to my judge, facing these same charges 50 years ago, told me many years later,
*  decades later, that his recommendation was to Judge Byrne—he's now a law professor or even
*  retired, I believe—that his recommendation was that our defense brief, that this prosecution was
*  manifestly unconstitutional, and that the Espionage Act should be rescinded as unconstitutional,
*  right at that, should be followed. It was his understanding that Matthew Byrne, my judge,
*  agreed with that, but it was Byrne's first case. To rule a major piece of legislation like the
*  Espionage Act unconstitutional in the first days of his first case was something he didn't want
*  to take on. So he took that under advisement to judge on it at the end of the trial.
*  And since the trial ended just before it went to the jury, or he made his closing comments
*  because of governmental crimes against me that had just been revealed—crimes, by the way,
*  that have been now revealed to be committed exactly against Julian Assange. These were crimes that led
*  to dismissal of all charges against me, as they should have. Assange, like me, was illegally
*  surveilled. In his case, even his lawyers and his doctors' discussions were surveilled.
*  And efforts, discussions were made of kidnapping and killing him, or poisoning, just as a dozen
*  CIA assets were brought up from Miami on May 3, 1973, by President Nixon, with orders to
*  incapacitate Daniel Ellsworth totally, whatever that means. But obviously Assange should be
*  let out for that. The lawyers will undoubtedly move to introduce that evidence as well,
*  if their constitutional argument is still being under advisement.
*  That argument has, by the way, never been addressed by the Supreme Court.
*  The classification system rests on no legislation. It's an executive branch set of regulations
*  like the non-disclosure agreements in any corporation or union or whatever private group.
*  No legislation backs it as a government regulation. But the First Amendment does keep
*  the government from enacting acts that would limit speech to that extreme extent. Then, while perhaps
*  this is pending, maybe they have that under advisement, and the acts that should end his
*  prosecution of listening in in his bathroom, in case he went into there for private discussions,
*  with his lawyers, and all that went to the CIA, that should end the trial. If it continues,
*  then I presume he will very strongly—I am certain he will plead not guilty, not with respect to the
*  facts, which I stipulated entirely. I did what I did. But to the very point that John Young made
*  a moment ago, if I may say, correcting you, Amy, we were not admitting to—and Julian would not be
*  admitting to any crime and would not feel that he had made any crime any more than I did. He had
*  violated regulations which, put into criminal law, constitute a constitutional violation
*  of his rights and of the possibility of democracy. So we're pleading not guilty on the grounds that
*  we had violated no constitutional law. There would be a lot of discussion and effects.
*  Dan, I wanted to read from the joint open letter from The New York Times, The Guardian,
*  Lamond of France, Der Spiegel of Germany and El País of Spain, who wrote against the prosecution
*  of Julian Assange under the Espionage Act, saying it, quote, sets a dangerous precedent
*  that threatens to undermine the First Amendment and the freedom of the press,
*  quote, obtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public
*  interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work has criminalized our
*  public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker. It continues holding
*  governments accountable as part of the core mission of a free press and a democracy.
*  Can you talk about having the Pentagon Papers published by The New York Times decades ago,
*  Dan Ellsberg, what it means to have The Times and these other major papers in the world
*  demanding the Biden administration drop this case and whether you've heard from the Biden
*  administration? Well, I'm very happy that The Times, El País, Lamond, The Guardian and the
*  the other El País, Lamond, The Guardian, Times, I'm missing somebody there.
*  Spiegel. Der Spiegel. Have all finally realized, the foreign ones, that they can be extradited,
*  just like Julian, an Australian who happened to be in England, and he's being extradited for this,
*  meaning that any one of those editors is as indictable as he is on exactly the same charges.
*  And there are secretaries on the charges that could be brought against me, of holding this
*  material, not delivering it up, not telling the FBI, et cetera. So they finally realized what I've
*  been telling them for 50 years, literally since my trial, without success. And that is that the
*  plain language of this act applies to them as well as to their sources and to their readers,
*  as a matter of fact, or to anybody who handles this information. They paid no attention for 50
*  years. To my knowledge, none of those papers ever lifted a finger for any of their sources,
*  their legal processes, or anything. They don't seem to regard sources as any responsibility
*  there is, even if they've gotten a Pulitzer Prize for those efforts. So no effort to the defense,
*  no nothing, nor have they informed themselves about the law. Well, for decades, they probably
*  saw me as crying wolf. There hadn't yet been a case against a journalist, although the language
*  was right there to do it. If a president came along and a Justice Department that was prepared
*  to experiment with using it more broadly against the journalist, well, finally that happened under
*  Trump. And they have suddenly come to realize that he's right against now extradition and a court case,
*  which will raise these issues. And I'm trying to point out to them that it can go even further.
*  I had all of the material that Julian Assange had from Chelsea Manning. I did not publish it,
*  because I was a backup and the newspapers ended up publishing it, except, by the way, Amy, for a
*  particularly atrocious attack, a video and report on Guarani in the Middle East War that killed over
*  100 women and children. And although it was known that it happened, the report and the video of that,
*  like the collateral murder video of the killing of civilians in Iraq, was held. It may not even
*  have been classified as the collateral murder wasn't classified, but that doesn't mean it wasn't
*  held closely. Chelsea got it only under—and she saw it initially. It was very moved by it.
*  She says in her wonderful book, Read Me, I just read that, and describes the impact of seeing that.
*  Carrie says, much more than just reading words about it. But I had that at the time,
*  but I didn't know it. It was among 100,000 documents, and I was merely retaining, and
*  any discussion of what to do about them would await if it was blocked otherwise.
*  I didn't know about the Guarani video. We've been trying to get—now there's a Freedom of
*  Information Act, of course, for 12 years that hasn't gotten anywhere. But you and I discussed
*  that when we heard about the attack and that it had not been released for reasons we didn't know.
*  Turns out it's still too enciphered. By the way, President Biden has no problem
*  in disclosing it any day, and he should have done that. Trump the same, Obama the same.
*  It's been 12 years, and we discuss it here on Democracy Now! But the questions all still remain.
*  AMY GOODMAN
*  Before we end the segment, we just have 30 seconds, but John Young, founder of Cryptome.org,
*  you still have these documents up that—on Cryptome.org—that Julian Assange has been
*  charged for at WikiLeaks?
*  JOHN YOUNG, FUNDER COUNCIL FOR CRIPTOME.ORG
*  Yes.
*  AMY GOODMAN Are you going to take them down?
*  JOHN YOUNG, FUNDER COUNCIL FOR CRIPTOME.ORG
*  No.
*  AMY GOODMAN As the government asked you to?
*  JOHN YOUNG, FUNDER COUNCIL FOR CRIPTOME.ORG
*  I'd just like to make a kind of a quip here, but I think that this whole thing might be called
*  espionage theater. I think the intelligence agencies are looking for a spectacle.
*  In the field of cybersecurity, there's something called cybersecurity theater,
*  which is fake threats. I think that there are—if you read these charges, they are
*  repetitious. They cited just a few paragraphs of Title 18. And I think that they want this
*  trial for their own purposes. There was a hearing a few days ago in which all these
*  intelligence agencies were patting each other on the back at Assange's expense.
*  So I think intelligence agencies want this spectacle to feather their own nest,
*  and it's an unfair treatment of Assange for this purpose.
*  AMY GOODMAN Well, I want to thank you, John Young, for joining us, founder of Cryptome.org.
*  And Dan Ellsberg, Pentagon Papers Whistleblower, if you could stay with us,
*  want to ask you a question about the growing threat of nuclear war. Stay with us.
