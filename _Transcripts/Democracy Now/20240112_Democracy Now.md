# Top U.S. & World Headlines â€” January 12, 2024
**Democracy Now!:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLK4zh3qwKk)
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  The United States and Britain have launched dozens of strikes from the Aran Sea, targeting
*  Yemen in a move many fear could trigger a broader regional war.
*  At least five people were killed.
*  The strikes targeted areas in Yemen controlled by Houthi forces, who've been attacking Israeli-linked
*  ships in the Red Sea to protest Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
*  So far, the Houthis have not killed anyone aboard the ships, but the group's actions
*  have disrupted a key global trade route.
*  In a statement, President Biden said, quote,
*  These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will
*  not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,
*  unquote.
*  President Biden is the fourth U.S. president in a row to bomb Yemen.
*  Houthi officials have vowed to retaliate against the strikes and continue targeting Israeli-linked
*  ships in the Red Sea until a ceasefire in Gaza is declared.
*  We say to all countries, to Asian countries like China and others, we say to European
*  countries in the West, we say to everyone in the world, there is no problem for you
*  to transverse and pass through the Red Sea.
*  The only targets exclusively are ships linked to Israel.
*  The Houthis, who control parts of Yemen, are seen as a member of the Iranian-backed Axis
*  of Resistance, a loose-knit group of forces in the region that also include Hamas and
*  Hezbollah.
*  Meanwhile, in Washington, President Biden is facing pushback from some lawmakers for
*  bombing Yemen without congressional approval.
*  In a message on social media, Congressmember Rashida Tlaib said the president's violating
*  Article 1 of the Constitution.
*  She went on to say, quote,
*  The American people are tired of endless war.
*  At the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Israel rejected claims by South
*  Africa that it's committing genocide against Palestinians.
*  On Thursday, South Africa demanded an emergency suspension of Israel's aerial and ground
*  assault on Gaza, which it said was intended to bring about, quote,
*  The destruction of the population of the territory.
*  Earlier today in court, Israel accused South Africa of distorting the situation in Gaza.
*  If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated
*  against Israel.
*  If there is a concern about the obligations of states under the Genocide Convention,
*  then it is in relation to their responsibilities to act against Hamas's proudly declared
*  agenda of annihilation.
*  On Thursday, pro-Palestinian rallies were held in South Africa as the ICJ began hearings.
*  Many South Africans praised their government for supporting the people of Gaza.
*  South Africa is very brave to have done what it's done, and I'm hoping that this does
*  not work against us as a country, but really it works to ensure that the people of Palestine
*  get the justice that they deserve.
*  In more news on Gaza, the NGO Save the Children says more than 10,000 Palestinian children
*  have been killed by Israel's assault.
*  That's 1 percent of the total child population in Gaza.
*  At least 1,000 children have lost one or both limbs.
*  This comes as doctors warn conditions inside Gaza's remaining hospitals continue to deteriorate
*  amidst Israeli attacks and dwindling supplies.
*  Today, the area around Al-Aqsa was hit.
*  All ambulances were destroyed.
*  We even started to run out of medical supplies.
*  And sadly, we have cases we can't do anything about.
*  We have nothing to offer, so we feel completely helpless.
*  This is very sad and bad, to be honest.
*  We hope that any side will be able to at least ensure the ability for the medical staff to
*  work.
*  The Intercept has obtained documents suggesting the U.S. Air Force sent officers to Israel
*  in November to help provide intelligence, including satellite data, to help Israel pick
*  targets to bomb in Gaza.
*  The document from November 21st references the deployment of an air defense liaison team
*  to Israel.
*  Craig MacKibber, a former U.N. official who resigned over the war in Gaza, said the Intercept's
*  report is, quote,
*  Here in New York, Donald Trump's $370 million civil fraud trial wrapped up Thursday with
*  Trump insulting the judge overseeing the case and accusing New York Attorney General Letitia
*  James of persecuting him, saying she should pay him for what he called a political witch
*  hunt.
*  An extraordinary courtroom scene unfolded.
*  Judge Arthur Nguyen, who had denied Trump's request to deliver his own closing statement,
*  instructed his lawyer to, quote,
*  Attorney General James spoke to reporters outside the courthouse.
*  This is our last day in our case against Donald Trump for persistent and repeated fraud.
*  Illegality.
*  This case has never been about politics or personal vendetta or about name-calling.
*  This case is about the facts and the law.
*  And Mr. Donald Trump violated the law.
*  And as you know, the judge has already found that he, in fact, violated the law for repeated
*  fraud over a period of years.
*  In Ohio, a grand jury has refused to indict a woman who was charged with felony abuse
*  of a corpse after having a miscarriage at home.
*  Thirty-four-year-old Brittany Watts was then treated in a hospital where a nurse called
*  the police after Watts said she had to dispose of the contents of her miscarriage.
*  She was criminally charged two weeks later.
*  She had been refused abortion care prior to her miscarriage.
*  Brittany Watts spoke to supporters at a rally Thursday.
*  I want to thank my community, Warren, Warren, Ohio.
*  I was born here, I was raised here, I graduated high school here, and I'm going to continue
*  to stay here because I have to continue to fight.
*  The Abortion Fund for Ohio said, quote, We're grateful for today's decision, but remain
*  livid at the circumstances that brought us here.
*  Ohioans, especially black women, fear for their lives and freedom during pregnancy,
*  pregnancy loss and abortion.
*  It's unacceptable.
*  We deserve so much better, and we demand it, they said.
*  The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into Boeing and whether the
*  company failed to ensure its 737 MAX 9 planes were safe following last week's incident
*  in which a cabin panel blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight, causing the cabin
*  to depressurize.
*  The FAA has since grounded the MAX 9 pending inspection of the aircraft.
*  Meanwhile, passengers from Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 have sued Boeing for injuries
*  sustained during the ordeal.
*  In related news, the Lever is reporting Republican presidential hopeful former Boeing board member
*  Nikki Haley helped quash a proposal to compel Boeing to be more transparent about its spending.
*  The measure sought to uncover whether Boeing's lobbying led to more lax regulations in the
*  wake of two major crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed all
*  346 people on board.
*  The Pentagon's inspector general says the Pentagon has failed to track some $1 billion
*  in military equipment provided to Ukraine for its fight against Russia's invasion.
*  The weapons in question include javelins, Stinger missiles, night vision devices and
*  one-way attack drones.
*  This comes as the White House said Thursday U.S. support for Ukraine, quote, has now ground
*  to a halt, unquote, amidst snarled negotiations over a new funding package that congressional
*  Republicans are demanding be conditioned on further militarizing the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  In Taiwan, voters are preparing to cast ballots Saturday in a high-stakes presidential and
*  parliamentary election that's being closely watched by China and the United States.
*  Three candidates are in a tight race to succeed President Tsai Ing-wen, who is not eligible
*  to run again after serving her two four-year terms.
*  The election could help decide whether Taiwan continues to assert its autonomy and strengthen
*  ties to the U.S., moves closer to China or takes what one candidate calls a middle path.
*  And a retrial is underway on the Greek island of Lesbos for 16 rescue workers who helped
*  save the lives of refugees who crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2015 and 16.
*  Greek authorities have accused the aid workers of crimes, including espionage, on what's
*  been slammed as the criminalization of humanitarian work.
*  Just this week, at least three migrants died after their boat sank off Lesbos.
*  And those are some of the headlines.
