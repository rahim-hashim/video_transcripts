# “Russia & China, Together at Last”: Historian Al McCoy Predicts Ukraine War to Birth New World Order
**Democracy Now!:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzotonmeTn0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours Friday, with much
*  of the discussion focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  Biden reportedly warned Xi that China will face consequences if it provides material
*  support to Russia.
*  It was the first call between the two leaders of the world's two largest economies in
*  four months.
*  In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Beijing for talks with Xi ahead
*  of the invasion.
*  Earlier this month, China joined India, Iran, Pakistan and 32 other nations from the global
*  South in abstaining from a United Nations vote condemning Russia's war in Ukraine.
*  On Saturday, China's vice foreign minister criticized NATO as a, quote, "'cold war
*  vestige' and criticized Western sanctions and Russia saying globalization is being used
*  as a weapon.
*  To look more at China's evolving relations with both Russia and the United States, we're
*  joined by Alfred McCoy, professor of history at University of Wisconsin-Madison, author
*  of numerous books, most recently To Govern the Globe, World Orders and Catastrophic Change.
*  His recent article for The Nation is headlined, Russia and China Together at Last.
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Professor McCoy.
*  Why don't you start off by responding to the talk that President Biden and Xi Jinping
*  had on Friday, what we learned of what they said?
*  Apparently, what President Biden was hoping to accomplish in his phone conversation with
*  Xi Jinping was to draw on their successful video meeting last November and kind of encourage
*  or even pressure President Xi to back away from China's strong support for Russia's
*  invasion of Ukraine.
*  And that did not happen.
*  President Xi's quote, the most memorable, the most important quote, was he wanted the
*  United States to untie the knot of Ukrainian and Russian security.
*  And that was a kind of oblique reference to the idea that the United States and NATO are
*  responsible for Russia's invasion of Ukraine by expanding NATO right up to the borders
*  of Russia and threatening Russian security.
*  And that's also a reference to the historic meeting between Putin and Xi Jinping on February
*  4th of this year when the two met during the Winter Olympics and they issued an historic
*  5,300-word declaration that laid claim to establishing a kind of new global order to
*  attacking U.S. global hegemony and to build upon their strong bilateral alliance, their
*  very close economic integration in the field of energy, and to simultaneously block NATO
*  from threatening Russia and block the United States from supporting Taiwan against China's
*  legitimate claims to Taiwan.
*  And so, in effect, what that meeting failed to accomplish was it simply failed to break
*  this emerging alliance between China and Russia, which is literally shaking the current world
*  order.
*  I wanted to turn to Cheng Gang, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, appearing
*  on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday.
*  He was questioned by Margaret Brennan.
*  Has Xi Jinping, your president, told Vladimir Putin to stop the invasion?
*  Do you condemn it?
*  Actually, on the second day of Russia's military operation, President Xi Jinping did
*  talk to President Putin.
*  Was that their last phone call?
*  Asking President Putin to think about resuming peace talks with Ukraine.
*  And President Putin listened to it, and we have seen four rounds of peace talks have
*  happened.
*  Let me continue.
*  China's trusted relations with Russia is not a liability.
*  It is an asset in the international efforts to solve the crisis in a peaceful way, you
*  know.
*  And China is part of the solution.
*  It's not part of the problem.
*  Professor McQuay, can you respond to the significance of what the Chinese ambassador to the United
*  States said?
*  Of course.
*  He is again kind of affirming what President Xi said in that meeting last Friday with President
*  Biden.
*  In essence, that China is not going to rupture its relations with Russia.
*  It's not going to apply pressure on Russia.
*  It's not going to blame Russia.
*  It's not going to call the Russian invasion of Ukraine an invasion.
*  And it is going to affirm that Russia has legitimate security concerns in Ukraine that
*  must be met, and that if China's going to do anything, it is going to apply its considerable
*  international power and prestige to support Russia in establishing its security in Eastern
*  Europe.
*  What I think was going on more broadly is that we're seeing a sense of extraordinary
*  confidence from Moscow and Beijing that literally history and more importantly geopolitics is
*  on their side.
*  They believe that their alliance gives them such dominance, such power on the massive
*  Eurasian landmass that they can prevail, that they can not only dominate the landmass, they
*  can dominate international politics.
*  In essence, they are pursuing a geopolitical strategy to break U.S. control over the Eurasian
*  landmass and thereby break U.S. global power.
*  They think that they are witnessing the birth, the historic birth of a new world order in
*  which the great global hegemon, the United States, which has dominated the world for
*  the past 70 years, in which its global power is broken and its dominance over Eurasia,
*  something the United States has maintained since the start of the Cold War in the early
*  1950s, but that is coming also to an end.
*  This is the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, talking about Biden's meeting with
*  Xi Jinping on video phone call.
*  The movement of China to align with Russia or to—yeah, the movement of them to align
*  with Russia or their proximity of moving closer together is certainly of great concern to
*  as we have expressed.
*  And we are not the only country that has expressed that concern, including many other members
*  of the G7 have expressed exactly that concern.
*  So this is part of the discussion.
*  It has been an ongoing part of the discussion.
*  Expect it certainly would be when the president goes to Europe next week, but we're not
*  in a place at this point to outline the specifics.
*  We're still discussing.
*  So, if you can talk more about, Professor McCoy, what Biden threatened, if it has an
*  effect.
*  You know, he is going to Europe this week.
*  He's speaking with a lot of European nations today, then meeting in Brussels with other
*  NATO members, then going to Poland to hold bilateral talks Friday and Saturday.
*  What this means for Russia and then for Russia and China?
*  The United States is concerned, I think, in two areas.
*  One that China will provide weaponry and financial support.
*  And in fact, China can break the financial embargo that the United States is trying to
*  impose upon Russia in order to restrain them in their invasion of Ukraine.
*  And so what Washington is monitoring is flows of weapon and flows of financial support from
*  China to Russia.
*  That's the United States is trying to restrain.
*  And the weapons may have a short-term impact.
*  The financial flows are a medium-term impact.
*  That's the U.S. concern.
*  But I think we need to sort of analyze the situation in dual tracks.
*  One, focus on the diplomacy, the military activity in Ukraine, the course of the war
*  on the battlefield.
*  OK?
*  That may or may not go Putin's way.
*  But underlying that, there is this extraordinary confidence in Moscow and Beijing that the
*  geopolitics of Eurasia are on their side, that because of their alliance and their dominant
*  position in this great landmass that comprises 70 percent of the world's population and productivity,
*  that almost inevitably they are going to emerge as the new centers of global power on the
*  planet.
*  And that, I think, is underlying their boldness and their resistance to Washington's pressure.
*  So we can, from their perspective, we can provide weapons.
*  We can mount financial pressure.
*  We can even impact the situation on the battlefield by providing anti-tank missiles and hand-held
*  weapons that can—they can bring—like Stinger missiles that can bring down Russian helicopters
*  and aircraft.
*  We can do all that.
*  But that is not material.
*  That's not what's going to matter.
*  They believe, because of the theory of geopolitics, that being the dominant powers in this great
*  Eurasian landmass, that they can slowly break the controls that the United States has imposed
*  over Eurasia since the start of the Cold War.
*  And they can break U.S. global power, and they together can construct a new global order.
*  And every global hegemon—and that's the word that Beijing and Moscow use—every global
*  hegemon for the last 500 years, from the Portuguese to the Spanish, the Dutch, the British, the
*  United States, and now the Chinese, have done one thing in common.
*  They have all dominated Eurasia.
*  Their rise to global power, including the U.S. rise to global power after World War II,
*  was accompanied by dominance over Eurasia.
*  And decline of all of these global powers, including the United States, has been marked
*  by their declining control over Eurasia.
*  And together, Beijing and Moscow are pursuing a strategy that I call, you know, push, push,
*  punch.
*  So, they're pushing at these great chains of geopolitical control that the United States
*  has ringed around Eurasia since the Cold War.
*  Naval fleets, air bases, mutual defense pacts.
*  They're pushing slowly at the east and west ends of Eurasia, hoping to strain and break
*  those chains of control that the United States has imposed over Eurasia, until, in succession
*  of these punches, those chains of control snap.
*  U.S. dominance over Eurasia comes to an end, and correspondingly, in the theory of geopolitics,
*  U.S. global power also declines.
*  So, Professor McCoy, one of the key reasons binding Russia to China, in addition to what
*  you've been talking about, is that Russia is a major energy exporter.
*  China is one of the world's leading energy importers.
*  Put that together with The Wall Street Journal reporting last week Saudi Arabia's and
*  active talks with Beijing to price some of its oil sales to China and yuan, a move that
*  would dent the U.S. dollar's dominance of the global petroleum market.
*  China buys more than a quarter of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports.
*  If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China's currency.
*  Can you talk about the significance of both the currency and energy politics?
*  Sure.
*  One of the foundations of U.S. global powers, right since the end of World War II, has been
*  that the dollar has been the functional global reserve currency.
*  That was set at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.
*  In 1971, when President Nixon ended the automatic convertibility of dollars to gold, Saudi Arabia
*  announced that they would keep conducting their petroleum transactions in dollars.
*  Since oil is the most negotiated of all international commodities, if the world is doing its oil
*  business in dollars, that means the dollar has that continuing support as global reserve
*  currency.
*  Since 2015, the Chinese currency has become a part of the international basket of currencies
*  recognized by the International Monetary Fund.
*  As China's dominance over the global economy grows and it becomes the world's largest
*  economy, the Chinese currency's role in that international economy is going to increase.
*  And once the dollar declines, that is the most negotiable, the most visible part of
*  U.S. global dominance.
*  Global dominance will follow the decline of the dollar downward.
*  How do you see all of this playing out, Professor McCoy?
*  Short term, I think that what we're looking at is kind of a parallel of what happened
*  with the last time China and Russia were allied.
*  In the early 1950s, Mao Zedong went to Moscow.
*  He was a supplicant.
*  He formed an alliance with Joseph Stalin, and Joseph Stalin cashed in that alliance
*  very quickly by using China to enter the Korean War.
*  China fought in Korea for three years.
*  It cost them about 40 percent of China's budget, 200,000 dead Chinese soldiers.
*  We're looking at it as kind of a reprise of that.
*  Putin comes to Beijing in February in the Winter Olympics.
*  He's now the supplicant.
*  He needs China's diplomatic and economic support for his Ukraine invasion.
*  At the moment of this very strong alliance, again, this time Putin attacks.
*  He's sacrificing his budget, his soldiers, in this strategy of pushing and pushing and
*  breaking the U.S. dominance over Eurasia.
*  I see long term the growing power of China over the Eurasian continent, their Belt and
*  Road Initiative, this trillion dollar development program that now incorporates around 70 nations
*  in Eurasia and Africa, laying down infrastructure, pipelines, railroads and roads across the
*  whole Eurasian landmass.
*  If this development project succeeds, and it's ten times the size of the Marshall Plan
*  that the United States used to rebuild Europe after World War II, it's the biggest development
*  scheme in human history.
*  If this scheme works in laying down infrastructure of rails, pipelines and roads across the Eurasian
*  landmass, and that draws the commerce of Eurasia, home to 70 percent of the world's population,
*  towards Beijing, then almost as if by natural law, power and prestige and global leadership
*  will flow towards Beijing.
*  And so what we're witnessing is the violent eruptions of a great tectonic shift in global
*  power.
*  As U.S. global power declines, China ascends, power shifts from the West, Europe and the
*  United States, towards Asia.
*  And we're witnessing then an historic change that is for the—I'd say by 2030, by the
*  end of this decade, it will become clear that U.S. global power has eclipsed, that power
*  has shifted to Beijing and the Eurasian landmass, and they are the new global hegemony.
*  Constructing a new kind of world order, far less concerned with human rights, far less
*  concerned with law, a kind of transactional world order of mutual convenience.
