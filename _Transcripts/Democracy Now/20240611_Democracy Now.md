We speak with U.S. Army Major Harrison Mann, the first military and intelligence officer to publicly resign over the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza. Mann left his role at the Defense Intelligence Agency after a 13-year career, saying in a public letter explaining his resignation that "nearly unqualified support for the government of Israel … has enabled and empowered the killing and starvation of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians." Mann submitted his resignation on November 1, just over three weeks into Israel's assault on Gaza, but his separation from the military became effective last week. "Even in the first weeks after October 7 … it was really clear that they were prepared to inflict huge numbers of civilian casualties," Mann tells Democracy Now! "I understood that every day that I was going to go into the office, I was going to be contributing to the Israeli campaign." Mann also explains how his Jewish background impacted his decision to resign, saying that while he was proud to wear the same uniform of soldiers who liberated Nazi concentration camps during World War II, it was "impossible" not to see echoes of the Holocaust in the devastation of Gaza. "Seeing photos of charred bodies and burnt corpses and starved, emaciated children that are from 2023, 2024, not the '40s, it's impossible not to make that connection," says Mann. "The situations are not perfectly analogous, but the moral similarities were very clear to me."

# U.S. Jewish Army Intel Officer Quits over Gaza, Says Impossible Not to See Echoes of Holocaust
**Democracy Now:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0PuMRCRlYQ)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  We end today's show with the first military and intelligence officer to publicly resign
*  over the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza.
*  Jewish-American Army Major Harrison Mann resigned from his role at the Defense Intelligence
*  Agency after a 13-year career.
*  The DIA is essentially the Pentagon's CIA.
*  In a letter explaining his resignation he posted online last month, Mann wrote, quote,
*  "...this office does not only inform policy, it facilitates and at times directly executes
*  policy.
*  And the policy that's never been far from my mind for the past six months is the nearly
*  unqualified support for the government of Israel, which has enabled and empowered the
*  killing and starvation of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians.
*  As we were recently reminded, this unconditional support also encourages reckless escalation
*  that risks wider war," he wrote.
*  Mann submitted his resignation November 1st, just over three weeks into Israel's assault
*  on Gaza.
*  His separation from the military became effective last week.
*  Harrison Mann joins us now from Washington, D.C.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Harrison, if you can go back to November and talk about what drove you to decide to separate
*  from the U.S. military.
*  You were a U.S. Army Major who worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency and explain
*  exactly what your role was and what the DIA does.
*  Yes, and thank you for having me.
*  So just in terms of what I was seeing, what drove my decision back in October is even
*  in the first weeks after October 7th, with the start of the Israeli air campaign on Gaza,
*  it was really clear that they were prepared to inflict huge numbers of civilian casualties,
*  which they did and which are a trend your last guest described in really heartbreaking
*  detail.
*  So there's very high tolerance and willingness to inflict civilian casualties, which we already
*  saw.
*  We already saw the autoimmune response from U.S. and Israeli adversaries or Iranian proxies
*  in the region with, I think, the first Houthi attack starting in mid-October.
*  And really beyond those risks and the humanitarian cost, it was really clear both at the national
*  level and from what I was hearing from the senior leadership in my community that our
*  support for Israel was going to be really unshakable and unconditional, no matter how
*  many people they killed and how they conducted the war.
*  And my job at the time was assistant to the director of basically the Middle East and
*  Africa Office for the agency, who was also the official who oversaw the Israel crisis
*  response.
*  So I was very well placed to understand some of the higher level discussions happening
*  about the war and about U.S. support to the war.
*  And that really left me feeling hopeless that we were going to condition or moderate our
*  aid or our support in any way.
*  And Harrison, I'm wondering if you could talk about, from the perspective of what the Defense
*  Intelligence Agency, the kind of information it was collecting, even before the events
*  of October 7th and this new war, to your knowledge, has there ever been a situation like Gaza,
*  where basically people were in an open air prison, where the Israelis essentially controlled
*  all ingress and egress from the territory and were able to cut off any kind of contact
*  with the outside world whenever they wanted to?
*  Yeah, I mean, there's certainly been other conflicts, including in our region, where
*  other forces did some level of siege or cut off access to the population they were attacking.
*  And I think the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen against the Houthis, which until
*  recently had wound down, was probably the next closest example of a man-made humanitarian
*  crisis cutting off the entry of food and medication while bombing the population.
*  And in terms of what were the, why you decided specifically in the first few weeks as the
*  conflict began to resign, what were the main reasons that you felt you had to resign?
*  I mean, fundamentally, I understood that every day that I was going to go into the office,
*  I was going to be contributing to the Israeli campaign.
*  That was something that DOD was supporting.
*  It's something that DIA was supporting.
*  And I think it's open that we have a very close intelligence relationship with Israel.
*  And so I was tangentially involved in that.
*  And I kind of got more and more discouraged and hopeless that we were going to stop.
*  The U.S. was going to stop its support.
*  And I understood early on and was unfortunately validated in this that nobody was going to
*  come tell me to stop, nobody at any level in my chain of command, even people who I
*  think were sympathetic to what was happening to Palestinians, was going to ask me or anybody
*  I worked with to reconsider the support that we were facilitating.
*  Harrison Mann, you're an American Jew as well as an Army major working at the DIA.
*  How did your Jewish background influence your decision?
*  My Jewish background influenced both my service and my decision to leave.
*  I have a very distinct memory of several years ago going to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
*  Museum in Israel on a trip that was actually sponsored and hosted by the IDF.
*  And you go through that museum and you see all these sites of the Holocaust victims.
*  And then at the end, there's this giant blow up photo that I think is still there showing
*  a lot of U.S. Army soldiers interspersed with Holocaust camp survivors.
*  And they're attending a service led by a U.S. Army rabbi after their camp has been liberated.
*  And that, I think seeing that photo, which I hadn't seen before, was like one of my proudest
*  moments of my service, understanding that I got to wear the same uniform and be in the
*  same army as the men who liberated that camp.
*  And today, seeing photos of charred bodies and burnt corpses and starved emaciated children
*  that are from, you know, 2023, 2024, not the 40s, it's impossible not to make that connection.
*  And I guess it forced me to realize that that's what I was contributing to in the same uniform
*  instead of saving those people.
*  And so, I think the, you know, the situations are not perfectly analogous, but the moral
*  logic was very clear to me, because I'm Jewish.
*  I wanted to ask you about more recent events, like this weekend, and as your role as a DIA
*  officer, if you could explain what's really going on here.
*  Talking about the role of U.S. intelligence support in Israel's war in Gaza, this is
*  National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan speaking on CNNs from Paris.
*  The United States has been providing support to Israel for several months in its efforts
*  to help identify the locations of hostages in Gaza and to support efforts to try to secure
*  their rescue or recovery.
*  I'm not going to get into the specific operational or intelligence-related matters associated
*  with that because we need to protect those.
*  I can only just say that we have generally provided support to the IDF so that we can
*  try to get all of the hostages home, including the American hostages who are still being
*  held.
*  So I understand that intelligence, U.S. intelligence, assisted, but will you say anything about
*  U.S. personnel, U.S. weapons?
*  Well, the one thing I can say is that there were no U.S. forces, no U.S. boots on the
*  ground involved in this operation.
*  We did not participate militarily in this operation.
*  So no boots on the ground, Jake Sullivan says to Dan Abash of CNN.
*  He's talking about this weekend, when more than 270 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli
*  operation that freed four Israeli hostages in Nusadat in Gaza.
*  Israeli intelligence officials told the New York Times, this is in an article today, that
*  U.S. military officials in Israel provided some of the intelligence about the hostages
*  rescued on Saturday.
*  According to the Times, the Pentagon and the CIA have been providing information collected
*  from drone flights over Gaza, communications intercepts and other sources about the potential
*  location of hostages.
*  While Israel has its own intelligence, the United States and Britain have been able to
*  provide intelligence from the air and cyberspace that Israel cannot collect on its own, the
*  New York Times reports.
*  So Harrison Mann, talk more about this and what kind of support was, it looks like, provided
*  this weekend?
*  We can go more generally into, well, President Biden more recently said he's approving
*  a billion dollars more of just outright weapons to Israel.
*  Yeah, I think the operation this weekend is a kind of unusually public example of the
*  value of intelligence support that the U.S. provides to Israel, which is, you know, we've
*  had a longstanding and very strong relationship, and usually it's not discussed.
*  I think this weekend we saw how intel support, even if it's for a goal that I think is nominally,
*  you know, quite something that's difficult to dispute, which is rescuing hostages, can
*  nonetheless contribute to operations that kill what looks like a very large number of
*  civilians.
*  And I think it's also indicative of the value of the intel support that we give Israel.
*  And I just highlight that because that's the area that I worked in or adjacent to.
*  And it's another form of valuable support that we give Israel that helps them prosecute
*  this war.
*  And it's another less discussed form of leverage that we also have over the Israeli government.
*  And Harrison Mann, I'm wondering your moral concerns about what was going on in Gaza,
*  to what extent you shared it with other fellow military or defense intelligence people, and
*  what advice you would have to those in the military or the intelligence community that
*  are still grappling with their ethical concerns.
*  So for the first months after I initiated my resignation process, which did not actually
*  conclude until last week, I was really kind of afraid.
*  I didn't feel comfortable talking about this with anybody because nobody else was discussing
*  it.
*  And it felt like it was way outside of our norms and outside of what would be culturally
*  acceptable where I worked.
*  But in April, when I finally shared my resignation letter with my office, I got really overwhelmingly
*  positive and supportive feedback from the people that I worked with.
*  And I discovered that there were a lot of people who felt pretty much the same way that
*  I did and also felt like they could not openly discuss their concerns.
*  And since I've publicized my letter, more people from both my office and elsewhere in
*  the Department of Defense and the military have also reached out.
*  And my number one piece of advice or kind of tough love here is understanding again
*  that nobody is going to tell you to stop.
*  I do not think we are near an end to this conflict.
*  And so you are nowhere near the end of being finally told that you can stop participating
*  in it.
*  And so understanding that, you then have to realize that moderating your level of support
*  or participation is a choice the same way that going to work tomorrow and continuing
*  to support the Israeli campaign is a choice.
*  And I know that what I did is not feasible for a lot of people.
*  I understand that.
*  I know other folks in our line of work who have asked for a transfer or who have asked
*  their supervisor, hey, I'm going to keep doing all of the portfolios you give me but find
*  somebody else for Israel.
*  I think another possibly effective option is asking for an assurance in writing that
*  what you're doing is both legal and consistent with your organization's ethical standards
*  and value statements.
*  That's something I wish I had done, which I think would have given some people pause
*  because we're asking each other, we're asking our subordinates to do a lot of these
*  things and contribute to this conflict without really pausing to think about the ethical
*  dimension.
*  That's something I'm guilty of as well.
*  Harrison, man, we have—
*  And just finally—
*  Sorry, go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  I would just finally say if you can't do that, just start talking about it and letting
*  somebody that you work with know that they're not alone might be incredibly valuable in
*  and of itself.
*  We just have 10 seconds.
*  What effect did the protests have on you?
*  Do they make it inside?
*  The campus protests?
*  Yes.
*  I was just—it was further indication about whether or not I was on the right side of
*  history and, you know, how I'd be able to look back at this years from now, which is
*  what helped drive my decision.
