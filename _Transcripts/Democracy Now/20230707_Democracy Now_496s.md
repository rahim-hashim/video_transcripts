# "Directly Complicit": Shadi Hamid on How Obama Greenlighted 2013 Egypt Coup, Killing the Arab Spring
**Democracy Now!:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CWELoSyYN0)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman, as we end today's show, looking at this 10th anniversary of the 2013
*  coup in Egypt.
*  When General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi removed Egypt's first democratically elected president
*  from power, then led a purge of Muslim Brotherhood, government leaders and a crackdown on dissent.
*  Lessons for the Next Arab Spring is the headline of a new piece by Shabi Hamid, senior fellow
*  at the Brookings Institution, author of The Problem of Democracy, America, the Middle
*  East and the Rise and Fall of an Ideal.
*  Welcome to Democracy Now!
*  It's great to have you with us.
*  If you can start off by laying out what we now know about the role of the U.S., particularly
*  of President Obama, in response to the coup.
*  Yep.
*  Hi, Amy.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So Washington was directly complicit.
*  I think up until relatively recently, and certainly right after the coup 10 years ago,
*  there was a sense that the U.S. was caught off guard, that the Obama administration wanted
*  to do the right thing, but didn't know how and they didn't really have leverage.
*  That sort of kind of innocent bystander theory where America acts like, oh, what could we
*  do?
*  We're only the superpower of the world.
*  In recent years, more and more information has come out that suggests that the U.S.
*  played a quite negative role in the months and days leading up to the July 3, 2013 military
*  coup.
*  In my piece and in the book from which it's adapted, The Problem of Democracy, I interviewed
*  around 30 former and current senior U.S. officials and was able to get some spicy information
*  on certain key moments in those final days.
*  And it's not a positive picture.
*  And I do argue explicitly that Washington and Obama in particular gave what amounted
*  to a green light to the Egyptian military to proceed with the coup.
*  We could have done quite a bit more to stop it.
*  We could have threatened an immediate aid suspension before the coup happened.
*  And even after the coup happened, there was a chance to declare it a coup and cut assistance.
*  And that's what U.S. law requires in any coup d'etat where the military plays a decisive
*  role.
*  It is a legal obligation to cut aid.
*  Of course, President Obama got away from that or avoided that by not declaring it a coup.
*  So there are a number of these different things that when you sort of piece them together,
*  we can't really say that the U.S. didn't know what was going on.
*  And in fact, some senior officials, in particular John Kerry, was actually quite enthusiastic
*  about the coup.
*  And there was this very memorable phrase where he said that Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was, quote,
*  unquote, restoring democracy.
*  He said this after two massacres of Muslim Brotherhood supporters.
*  I mean, your piece is really interesting.
*  And I just want to read from it, because it really tells people how, you know, the government
*  works.
*  You write, A White House adviser who was there walked me through how the conversation unfolded.
*  He said, I came in all hot and bothered, and so did a few others, that there was a clear
*  letter of the law that said, declare the coup, cut off military assistance.
*  Actually, we weren't even focused on the first thing, because only somebody who was
*  purposefully obfuscating what would say that it wasn't a coup.
*  So it was like, when do we announce this?
*  That's when I came in, expecting the conversation was going to be about that.
*  And then, Obama, for the only time that I can recall in the years I worked for him,
*  the only time, he came in and said, well, so we're not going to declare this a coup,
*  so what should we do?
*  I was totally taken aback by that, and so were many other people.
*  And so it completely changed the tenor of the conversation.
*  I mean, this is fascinating.
*  I don't know if you want to reveal now who it was who was talking to you, but explain
*  what this means and why you think Obama took this stance and what now this has meant.
*  I mean, we're talking about thousands of people imprisoned, political prisoners.
*  Yeah, and it's really worth underscoring what kind ofâ€”how this is such a moral stain
*  on the Obama administration's legacy.
*  I do consider the coup to be the day that the Arab Spring ended.
*  After that, there was no hope of getting back.
*  Egypt is the most populous country in the region.
*  Egypt sets the tone.
*  So this was not just a minor thing.
*  This was decisive, and I hope it will be remembered in that way.
*  And that quote, just hearing you read it back to me, I still find it remarkable.
*  I can't share who it was because that's not the sort of thing this person would want to
*  be known for, but it is really remarkable.
*  And as for the reasons behind it, I think there's a couple of things going on here.
*  Obama also had this very pragmatic side to him where he would say, well, you know, if
*  a coup already happened, let me try to do business with the people who are in power.
*  Let me try to get things done.
*  I don't want too much headache of some big pro-democracy agenda.
*  Let's also keep in mind that Obama, when he assumed the presidency, wanted to distance
*  himself from the Bush administration's so-called freedom agenda.
*  So there was always a kind of discomfort with a very strong emphasis on democracy promotion.
*  But I think there's actually a darker undercurrent where Obama, after some initial enthusiasm
*  for the Arab Spring when it started in 2011, he gets very disillusioned very quickly.
*  And one of the things I discuss at length in the book is the sorts of things that Obama
*  would say privately and even sometimes publicly about Arabs and Muslims.
*  And there was that famous Atlantic profile from 2016 that reported that Obama was known
*  to privately joke, quote unquote, all I need in the Middle East is a few smart autocrats.
*  He also had another joke where he would say he would wonder out loud why people in the
*  Middle East can't be just like the Scandinavians.
*  So there was this sense of like, why can't the Muslims get their act together?
*  Why are they always fighting?
*  And Obama almost felt betrayed because he supported the Arab Spring, or at least he
*  thought he did in the beginning.
*  And then he kind of went and said, well, was I right to support it if it led to all this
*  civil conflict and all these clashes between different parties and ideological orientations?
*  And of course, let's remember too that Obama wanted to pivot away from the Middle East.
*  So there was a sense that he was always being dragged back in.
*  And I think at some point, there was just a sense of, well, maybe if they were all autocrats,
*  things would be a lot easier.
*  And then just the last thing is we have a we have a democratic dilemma in the Middle
*  East.
*  We like democracy in theory, but we don't like democracy's outcomes in practice.
*  Why?
*  Because it's Islamist parties that tend to win elections or at least do quite well in
*  them when elections are held in the Middle East.
*  And the coup was committed against a Muslim Brotherhood led government.
*  Here's an Islamist party that believes that Sharia or Islamic law should play a central
*  role in public life.
*  And then we as Americans are just instinct instinctually uncomfortable with that.
*  We think democracy should lead to good outcomes.
*  But when it leads to Islamist outcomes, we struggle with that.
