*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!
*  co-host Juan González in Chicago.
*  Hi Juan, happy new year.
*  JUAN GONZÁLEZ DE LA CÁRLEA Happy new year to you, Amy, and welcome to
*  all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.
*  AMY GOODMAN As the death toll from Israel's bombardment
*  of Gaza since the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel now exceeds 22,000, South Africa's
*  filed a case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague accusing Israel of genocide
*  and trying to, quote, destroy Palestinians in Gaza.
*  This comes as this separate international criminal court is already investigating alleged
*  war crimes committed by both Israel and Hamas.
*  In its filing to the ICJ, the main judicial body for the United Nations, South Africa
*  says, quote, the acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa are genocidal
*  in character because they're intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial
*  part of the Palestinian national racial and ethnical group, unquote.
*  South Africa accused Israel of violating the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment
*  of the crime of genocide, which Israel has signed onto.
*  Israel responded by calling the charge, quote, without legal merit.
*  The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of, quote, collaborating with a terrorist
*  group that calls for Israel's annihilation, unquote.
*  South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians
*  in the occupied territories to the racist system of apartheid in his own country, which
*  ended in 1994 after nearly half a century.
*  In November, Ramaphosa responded to Israel's assault on Gaza by recalling South Africa's
*  diplomats from Israel.
*  The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians through the unlawful use of force by Israel
*  is a war crime.
*  The deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount
*  to genocide.
*  Meanwhile, in October, South African lawmaker and the grandson of Nelson Mandela and Kossi
*  Mandela joined a Palestinian solidarity protest in Cape Town.
*  For more, we're joined by Frances Boyle.
*  Professor of International Law at the University of Illinois College of Law.
*  He previously applied the Genocide Convention for Bosnia and won two requests for provisional
*  protection from the ICJ against Yugoslavia and thinks the same could apply here.
*  His books include The Bosnian People Charge Genocide, as well as Palestine, Palestinians
*  and International Law, and World Politics, Human Rights and International Law.
*  Professor Boyle, welcome back to Democracy Now!
*  It's good to have you with us in this new year, but under very serious circumstances.
*  If you can explain why it's South Africa that's bringing this charge and what exactly
*  is the International Court of Justice, where it fits into the world justice system, and
*  talk about the charge of genocide.
*  Well, thank you very much for having me on, Amy, my best year listening audience.
*  Not to toot my own horn here, but I was the first lawyer ever to win anything under the
*  Genocide Convention from the International Court of Justice that goes back to 1921.
*  I single-handedly won two world court orders for the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina against
*  Yugoslavia to cease and desist from committing all acts of genocide.
*  And based on my careful review of all the documents so far submitted by the Republic
*  of South Africa, I believe South Africa will win an order against Israel to cease and desist
*  from committing all acts of genocide against the Palestinians.
*  And then we will have an official determination by the International Court of Justice itself,
*  the highest legal authority in the United Nations system, that genocide is going on.
*  And under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention, all contracting parties, 153 states, will
*  then be obliged, quote, to prevent, unquote, the genocide by Israel against the Palestinians.
*  Second, when the world court gives the cease and desist order against Israel, the Biden
*  administration will stand condemned under Article 3, paragraph E of the Genocide Convention,
*  that criminalizes complicity in genocide.
*  And clearly we know that the Biden administration has been aiding and abetting Israeli genocide
*  against the Palestinians here for quite some time.
*  This has also been raised by my friends in the Center for Constitutional Rights and in
*  the National Lawyers Guild in a lawsuit against Biden, Blinken, and Austin.
*  So I believe we will be able to use the world court order.
*  Right now, my sources tell me the hearing will be January 11, January 12.
*  Based on my experience with the Bosnians, we can expect an order within a week.
*  I would also say, with respect to the Biden administration, they are currently in violation
*  of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act that makes genocide a crime under United
*  States law.
*  And again, once South Africa wins this order, the Biden administration also will stand in
*  violation of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act.
*  So I believe this is where we will be going between now, I would say, and the end of this
*  month.
*  And it is up to all of us as American citizens to figure out and support what South Africa
*  is doing at the International Court of Justice here.
*  Francis Boyle, what's the difference between the International Court of Justice and the
*  International Criminal Court, which is already considering allegations of war crimes by both
*  Israel as well as the Palestinian militant groups?
*  Right, Juan.
*  The International Court of Justice was originally established back in 1921, its predecessor,
*  legal predecessor in law.
*  And that is where I filed the genocide case.
*  I was the first lawyer ever to win two orders in one such case since the World Court was
*  founded in 1921, and it was on the basis of the Genocide Convention.
*  The International Criminal Court is a separate international organization set up in 2000.
*  The problem, Juan, is this.
*  Back in 2009, after Operation Cast Lead, I advised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
*  to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for Palestine, which he did.
*  I regret to report that the International Criminal Court has not done one darn thing
*  to help the Palestinians since 2009.
*  The International Criminal Court has all the blood of the Palestinian people on its hands
*  since 2009.
*  And Juan, that is why we set up a campaign to find a state willing to file a lawsuit
*  at the International Court of Justice, the World Court.
*  The ICC basically operates at the behest of its funders and founders and masters, which
*  is the U.S., the NATO states, the European states, etc.
*  Until their expedited indictment of President Putin as U.S.-NATO lawfare against Russia,
*  the International Criminal Court had not indicted one American, one European, one Brit, one
*  NATO citizen and one Israeli and one white person.
*  So we've gone, we have a campaign now to support the Republic of South Africa at the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  And we are asking, we're starting this campaign today, I'm part of a coalition, we're starting
*  this campaign today to get members of the Genocide Convention to file declarations of
*  intervention at the World Court in support and solidarity with South Africa against Israel
*  and in support of the Palestinians.
*  That material hopefully will go out today.
*  Francis, I wanted to ask you, though, Joan Donahue is the president of the International
*  Court of Justice.
*  She previously worked in the U.S.
*  State Department.
*  How do you think she will approach South Africa's application?
*  What power does she have to shape the proceedings?
*  That's a good question, Juan.
*  Yes.
*  Donahue is a lifelong, career-long U.S.
*  State Department legal operative, which is how she got the job.
*  And I'm sure she's in contact right now today with the U.S.
*  State Department, giving them a heads up on everything going on over there at The Hague
*  behind the scenes.
*  She will toe the State Department party line in these proceedings.
*  I regret to report the president does have a lot of power there to shape these proceedings.
*  I suspect she will use that power to shape the proceedings in favor of Israel.
*  However, I have also been advised that the Republic of South Africa is, as of now, nominating
*  a Judge Ad Hoc that is there right under the statute of the International Court of
*  Justice.
*  I don't have a name yet, but I would hope the South African Judge Ad Hoc will do his
*  or her best to try to keep Donahue straight.
*  I want to go back to South Africa, who has done this genocide filing.
*  In 2008, I had the opportunity to speak with the South African anti-apartheid icon, the
*  Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
*  I caught up with him at the South African Vice Consul's apartment in New York right
*  before Archbishop Tutu received the Global Citizens Circle Award.
*  I asked him about Palestine.
*  Would you compare the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank to apartheid in South Africa?
*  I have to speak about what I know.
*  I mean, most people, Jews, will usually speak about their experiences and maybe compare
*  whatever it is that is happening with what happened in the days of the Holocaust.
*  For me, coming from South Africa and going, I mean, and looking at the checkpoints and
*  the arrogance of those young soldiers, probably scared, maybe covering up their apprehension.
*  There was no way in which I couldn't see.
*  Of course, that is the truth.
*  It reminds me of the kind of experiences that we underwent.
*  So, that was Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
*  Francis Boyle, talk about the significance of it being South Africa and what it means
*  for one state to bring a charge against another state, who are signatories here, and how binding
*  is this?
*  Explain what happened, for example, in Bosnia.
*  Sure.
*  Well, first, the connection there with the late, great Archbishop Tutu.
*  The current lead counsel now in the lawsuit for South Africa is Professor John Dugard,
*  a longtime friend of mine.
*  Professor Dugard was one of the very few courageous white professors of international law,
*  who internationally opposed the criminal apartheid system in South Africa at risk to his life.
*  Second, later on, Professor Dugard became UN Special Rapporteur for Palestine.
*  I read all of his reports.
*  They are excellent.
*  Professor Dugard's heart and head are in the right place with the Palestinians,
*  and he is one of the top professors of international law in the world.
*  So, there is a direct comparison between the Israeli apartheid system on all the Palestinians,
*  including Palestinian citizens of Israel, and what happened in apartheid South Africa.
*  Indeed, Professor Dugard has written that the Israeli system of apartheid
*  against the Palestinians is worse than the apartheid that the Afrikaners
*  applied to the Black people in South Africa.
*  I was involved in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and that is my assessment, too.
*  Indeed, the parallels here then led me, in November 2000, to call for the establishment
*  in a speech, the establishment of the divestment-disinvestment campaign against Israel,
*  for the exact same reasons we had a divestment-disinvestment campaign
*  against the criminal apartheid regime in South Africa.
*  And then, in 2005, Palestinian civil society contacted me to go in with them on establishing
*  the Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel, against apartheid Israel,
*  for the exact same reason we had a BDS campaign against the criminal apartheid regime in South
*  Africa. So Tutu, Dugard, I, and I would, Ramaphosa, the foreign minister in South Africa,
*  who's made very compelling speeches, they all understand what's going on here and what's at stake.
*  AMY GOODMAN The issue of genocide in Bosnia, if you could explain for people who are not familiar
*  with what happened and then what came of the charges at the International Court of Justice.
*  DUDAR KUZMINIC Yes, well, Yugoslavia exterminated about
*  200,000 Bosnians, raped about 40,000 Bosnian women. I was the lawyer for all of them,
*  arguing their case at the International Court of Justice, and I won these two orders on 8 April 1993
*  and 13 September 1993. Until I won that order, 8 April 1993, everyone was denying that genocide
*  was going on. And once I won that order, that was massive and overwhelming in favor of the Bosnians,
*  no one could deny anymore that genocide was going on. As for the effectiveness,
*  when I walked out of the World Court on 8 April 1993 and won that order, I walked into the foyer
*  there outside the grand courtroom. The whole world news media were there, and I said at the time,
*  the World Court has just determined that genocide is going on in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
*  Under Article 1, every state party to the Genocide Convention has an obligation to prevent
*  genocide in Bosnia, and I hereby request direct military intervention by the United States and the
*  NATO states to save the Bosnians from genocide. Later that day, the United States and NATO
*  announced that they were instituting a no-fly zone, enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia.
*  So these orders by the World Court can have consequences, and it will be up to us here in
*  the United States to devise the strategy for consequences for the Biden administration,
*  because we have to pressure the Biden administration to order Israel to stop
*  the genocide. They will do what we Americans tell them to do. In Operation Cast Lead,
*  that had been going on for a period of time under President Bush Jr. Obama, the Obama people were
*  coming into power. Obama was about to be inaugurated, and in order not to spoil Obama's
*  inauguration, the United States government told Israel to stop Operation Cast Lead.
*  So we have to understand we here in the United States of America have the power to stop this,
*  but we have to figure out how to use the order that South Africa will win here in the United
*  States of America. This is exactly what happened in Nicaragua. You remember, Amy, I was involved
*  in advising almost every peace NGO and lawyer here in the United States on the legal issues
*  with respect to Reagan's war against Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala. My teacher, mentor and
*  friend, a late-grade Abe Jays at Harvard Law School, won a World Court order against the
*  Reagan administration in 1984, and then also a final judgment on the merits in 1986. We here
*  in the United States use that World Court order and the final judgment to stop Reagan's war
*  against Nicaragua. Regretfully—
*  We have 20 seconds.
*  Regretfully, 16,000 Nicaraguans were killed, including U.S. citizen Ben Linder,
*  but we did stop that. And I believe that with this World Court order that South Africa
*  will win, we can stop what Israel is doing to the Palestinians.
