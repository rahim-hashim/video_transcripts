# Jeffrey Sachs: U.S. Policy & "West's False Narrative" Stoking Tensions with Russia, China
**Democracy Now!:** [August 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmOePNsNFw0)
*  Well, Politico is reporting the Biden administration is preparing to ask Congress to approve a
*  new $1.1 billion arms sale to Taiwan.
*  The package reportedly includes 60 anti-ship missiles, 100 air-to-air missiles.
*  This comes after two U.S. warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait Sunday for the first
*  time since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan earlier this month.
*  China condemned the visit and launched major military drills near Taiwan.
*  Meanwhile, President Biden announced $3 billion in more military aid for Ukraine last week,
*  including money for missiles, artillery rounds and drones to help Ukrainian forces fight
*  Russia.
*  We begin today's show looking at U.S. policy on Russia and China.
*  We're joined by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development
*  at Columbia University.
*  He's president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
*  He served as adviser to three U.N. secretaries-general.
*  His latest article is headlined, The West's False Narrative About Russia and China.
*  He begins the article by writing, quote,
*  The world is on the edge of nuclear catastrophe in no small part because of the failure of
*  Western political leaders to be forthright about the causes of the escalating global
*  conflicts.
*  The relentless Western narrative that the West is noble while Russia and China are evil
*  is simple-minded and extraordinarily dangerous, Jeffrey Sachs writes.
*  Jeffrey Sachs, welcome to Democracy Now!
*  Why don't you take it from there?
*  Good to be with you.
*  What is the story that people in the West and around the world should understand about
*  what's happening right now with these conflicts with Russia, with Russia and Ukraine and with
*  China?
*  The main point, Amy, is that we are not using diplomacy.
*  We are using weaponry.
*  This sale now announced to Taiwan that you've been discussing this morning is just another
*  case in point.
*  This does not make Taiwan safer.
*  This does not make the world safer.
*  It certainly doesn't make the United States safer.
*  This goes back a long way.
*  I think it's useful to start.
*  Thirty years ago, the Soviet Union ended and some American leaders got it into their head
*  that there was now what they called the unipolar world, that the U.S. was the sole superpower
*  and we could run the show.
*  The results have been disastrous.
*  We have had now three decades of militarization of American foreign policy.
*  A new database that Tufts is maintaining has just shown that there have been more than
*  100 military interventions by the United States since 1991.
*  It's really unbelievable.
*  And I have seen in my own experience over the last 30 years, working extensively in
*  Russia, in Central Europe, in China, and in other parts of the world, how the U.S. approach
*  is a military first and often a military only approach.
*  We arm who we want.
*  We call for NATO enlargement no matter what other countries say may be harmful to their
*  security interests.
*  We brush aside anyone else's security interests.
*  And when they complain, we ship more armaments to our allies in that region.
*  We go to war when we want, where we want, whether it was Afghanistan or Iraq or the
*  covert war against Assad in Syria, which is even today not properly understood by the
*  American people, or the war in Libya.
*  And we say we're peace loving.
*  What's wrong with Russia and China?
*  They are so warlike.
*  They're out to undermine the world.
*  And we end up in terrible confrontations.
*  The war in Ukraine, just to finish the introductory view, could have been avoided and
*  should have been avoided through diplomacy.
*  What President Putin of Russia was saying for years was do not expand NATO into the
*  Black Sea, not to Ukraine, much less to Georgia, which if people look on the map, straight
*  across to the eastern edge of the Black Sea.
*  Russia said this will surround us.
*  This will jeopardize our security.
*  Let us have diplomacy.
*  The United States rejected all diplomacy.
*  I tried to contact the White House at the end of 2021.
*  In fact, I did contact the White House and said there will be war unless the U.S. enters
*  diplomatic talks with President Putin over this question of NATO enlargement.
*  I was told the U.S. will never do that.
*  That is off the table.
*  And it was off the table.
*  Now we have a war that's extraordinarily dangerous.
*  And we are taking exactly the same tactics in East Asia that led to the war in Ukraine.
*  We're organizing alliances, building up weaponry, trash-talking China, having Speaker Pelosi
*  fly to Taiwan when the Chinese government said, please, lower the temperature, lower
*  the tensions.
*  We say, no.
*  Do what we want and now send more arms.
*  This is a recipe for yet another war.
*  And to my mind, it's terrifying.
*  We are at the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which I've studied all my
*  life and I've written about, I've written a book about the aftermath.
*  We are driving to the precipice and we are filled with our enthusiasm as we do so.
*  And it's just unaccountably dangerous and wrongheaded, the whole approach of U.S. foreign
*  policy, and it's bipartisan.
*  Jeffrey Sachs, I wanted to ask you, one of the things that you mentioned in a recent
*  article that was published in Consortium News was this insistence of the United States
*  dragging Europe along as well in maintaining hegemony throughout the world at a time when
*  the economic power of the West is declining.
*  You mentioned, for instance, that the BRICS nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China and
*  South Africa, represent more than 40 percent of the world's population and have a greater
*  GDP than the G7 nations, yet their interests and their concerns are pretty much dismissed
*  or in the case, obviously, of Russia and China, portrayed to the American people as the aggressors,
*  the authoritarians, as the ones that are creating turmoil in the world.
*  I'm wondering if you could expand on that.
*  Absolutely.
*  And directing us to that is extremely important.
*  The disproportionate power of the Western world and especially the Anglo-Saxon world,
*  which started with the British Empire and now the United States, is about 250 years
*  old, so a short period in world history.
*  It happened for a lot of very interesting reasons that the Industrial Revolution came
*  to England first.
*  The steam engine was invented there.
*  That's probably the single most important invention of modern history.
*  Britain became militarily dominant in the 19th century, like the United States was in
*  the second half of the 20th century.
*  Britain ran the show.
*  Britain had the empire on which the sun never set.
*  And the West, meaning the United States and Western Europe, now meaning the U.S. and the
*  European Union, the UK, Canada, Japan, in other words, the G7, the European Union together,
*  is a small part of the world population, perhaps now roughly 10%, a little bit more, maybe
*  12.5% if you add in Japan to Western Europe and the U.S.
*  The mindset is we run the world.
*  And that was the way it was for 200 years in this industrial age.
*  But times have changed.
*  And really since the 1950s, the rest of the world, when it gained independence from European
*  imperialism, started to educate its populations, started to adopt and adapt and innovate technologies.
*  And lo and behold, a small sliver of the world really didn't run the world or didn't have
*  a monopoly on wisdom or knowledge or science or technology.
*  And this is wonderful.
*  The knowledge and possibility of decent lives is spreading throughout the whole world.
*  But in the United States, there's a resentment to this, a deep resentment.
*  And I think there's also a tremendous historical ignorance because I think a lot of U.S.
*  leaders have no clue as to modern history.
*  But they resent China's rise.
*  That is an affront to the United States.
*  How dare China rise?
*  This is our world.
*  This is our century.
*  And so starting around 2014, I saw step by step, I watched it with intense detail because
*  it's my daily activity, how the United States recast China, not as a country that was
*  recovering from a century and a half of great difficulty, but rather as an enemy.
*  And we consciously, as a matter of American foreign policy, started to say we need to
*  contain China.
*  China's rise is no longer in our interest, as if the United States is to determine whether
*  China is prosperous or not.
*  The Chinese are not naive.
*  In fact, they're extraordinarily sophisticated.
*  They watched all of this exactly the same way that I did.
*  I know the authors of the U.S.
*  texts there, my colleagues at Harvard or other places.
*  I was shocked when this kind of containment idea started to be applied.
*  But the basic point is the West has led the world for a brief period, 250 years, but feel
*  that's our right.
*  This is a Western world.
*  We are the G7.
*  We get to determine who writes the rules of the game.
*  Indeed, Obama, a good guy on the spectrum of what we have in foreign policy, said let's
*  write the rules of trade for Asia, but not have China write any of those rules.
*  The U.S. will write the rules.
*  This is an incredibly naive and dangerous and outmoded way to understand the world.
*  We in the United States are 4.2% of the world's population.
*  We do not run the world.
*  We are not world leader.
*  We are a country of 4.2% of the people in a big, diverse world.
*  And we should learn to get along, play in the sandbox peacefully, not demand that we
*  have all the toys in the sandbox.
*  We're not over that thinking yet.
*  Unfortunately, it's both political parties.
*  It's what motivates Speaker Pelosi to go to Taiwan in the middle of all of this, as if
*  she really had to go to stir up the tensions.
*  But it's the mindset that the U.S. is in charge.
*  JUAN GONZÁLEZ I wanted to go back a little bit, back into the 1990s.
*  You recall, I'm sure, the enormous financial collapse that occurred in Mexico in the 1990s,
*  where the Clinton administration authorized $50 billion in a bailout to Mexico, which was
*  really to Wall Street investors.
*  At the time, you were advising the post-Soviet Russian government, which also had a financial—had
*  deep financial problems at the time, but was unable to get any significant Western assistance,
*  or even from the International Monetary Fund.
*  You were critical of that at the time.
*  I'm wondering if you could talk about the differences, how the U.S. responded to the
*  Mexico crisis versus the Russian financial crisis, and what the roots of that may have
*  been in what the current situation is in Russia today.
*  MICHAEL ISIKOFF Absolutely.
*  I had a controlled experiment, because I was economic advisor both to Poland and to
*  the Soviet Union in the last year of President Gorbachev and to President Yeltsin in the first
*  two years of Russian independence, 1992-93.
*  My job was finance, to actually help Russia find a way to address, as you described it, a
*  massive financial crisis.
*  My basic recommendation in Poland, and then in Soviet Union and in Russia, was to avoid
*  a societal crisis and a geopolitical crisis.
*  The rich Western world should help to tamp down this extraordinary financial crisis that was
*  taking place with the breakdown of the former Soviet Union.
*  Well, interestingly, in the case of Poland, I made a series of very specific recommendations,
*  and they were all accepted by the U.S. government, creating a stabilization fund,
*  canceling part of Poland's debts, allowing many financial maneuvers to get Poland out of
*  the difficulty.
*  And I patted myself on the back, oh, look at this, I make a recommendation, and one of them,
*  for a billion dollars, stabilization fund was accepted within eight hours by the White House.
*  So I thought, pretty good.
*  Then came the analogous appeal on behalf of first Gorbachev in the final days, and then
*  President Yeltsin.
*  Everything I recommended, which was on the same basis of economic dynamics, was rejected
*  flat out by the White House.
*  I didn't understand it, I have to tell you, at the time.
*  I said, but it worked in Poland.
*  And they'd stare at me blankly.
*  In fact, an acting secretary of state in 1992 said, Professor Sacks, it doesn't even matter
*  whether I agree with you or not, it's not going to happen.
*  And it took me actually quite a while to understand the underlying geopolitics.
*  Those were exactly the days of Cheney and Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld and what became the
*  project for the new American century, meaning for the continuation of American hegemony.
*  I didn't see it at the moment because I was thinking as an economist how to help
*  overcome a financial crisis, but the unipolar politics was taking shape, and it was
*  devastating.
*  Of course, it left Russia in a massive financial crisis that led to a lot of instability that
*  had its own implications for years to come.
*  But even more than that, what these people were planning early on, despite explicit promises to
*  Gorbachev and Yeltsin, was the expansion of NATO.
*  And Clinton started the expansion of NATO with the three countries of Central Europe, Poland,
*  Hungary, and Czech Republic.
*  And then George W. Bush Jr. added seven countries, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
*  and the three Baltic states, but right up against Russia.
*  And then in 2008, the coup de grace, which was the U.S. insistence over the private opposition
*  of the European leaders.
*  And European leaders talked to me privately about it at the time.
*  But in 2008, Bush said NATO will expand to Ukraine and to Georgia.
*  And again, if you take out a map and look at the Black Sea, the explicit goal was to surround
*  Russia in the Black Sea.
*  By the way, it's an old playbook.
*  It's the same playbook as Palmerston in 1853 to 1856 in the first Crimean War.
*  Surround Russia in the Black Sea, cut off its ability to have a military presence and to
*  project any kind of influence into the Eastern Mediterranean.
*  Brzezinski himself said in 1997 that Ukraine would be the geographic pivot for Eurasia.
*  So what these neocons were doing in the early 1990s was building the U.S. unipolar world.
*  And they were already contemplating lots of wars in order to take out the former Soviet
*  allied countries.
*  Wars to overthrow Saddam, wars to overthrow Assad, wars to overthrow Gaddafi.
*  Those were all rolled out in the next 20 years.
*  They've been a complete disaster, debacle for those countries, horrible for the United States,
*  trillions of dollars wasted.
*  But it was a plan.
*  And that neoconservative plan is in its heyday right now on two fronts, in the Ukraine front
*  and on the Taiwan Straits front.
*  And it's extraordinarily dangerous what these people are doing to American foreign policy,
*  which hardly is a policy of democracy.
*  It's a policy of a small group that has the idea that
*  a unipolar world and U.S. hegemony is the way that we need to go.
*  Jeffrey Sachs, we don't have much time, but since this was such a big issue,
*  Naomi Klein took you on big time with the shock doctrine, talking about you
*  recommending shock therapy.
*  Can you draw a line between what happened as the Russian economy unraveled, to the conditions
*  leading up to the Ukraine invasion?
*  I mean, how did the economic catastrophe that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union
*  lead to the rise of the oligarchic class and indeed the presidency of Vladimir Putin?
*  Yeah, I've tried to explain to Naomi, whom I admire a great deal, for years that what
*  I was recommending was financial help to whether it was Poland or to the Soviet Union or to Russia.
*  I was absolutely aghast at the cheating and the corruption and the giveaways, and I
*  said so very explicitly at the time, and resigned over it, both because I was useless in trying to
*  get Western help and also because I did not like at all what was going on.
*  And I would say that the failure of an orderly approach, which was achieved in Poland,
*  but failed in the former Soviet Union because there was no Western constructive engagement,
*  definitely played a role in the instability in the 1990s, definitely played a role in the rise of
*  the oligarch class. In fact, I was absolutely explaining to the U.S. and to the IMF and the
*  World Bank in 1994-95 what was going on. They didn't care because they thought,
*  wow, that's okay, that's for Yeltsin, perhaps, all of that cheating in the shares for loans
*  process. Having said all of that—
*  We just have less than a minute.
*  Okay. Having said all of that, I think what is important to say is that there is no linear
*  determinism, even from events like that, which were destabilizing and very unhappy and unnecessary
*  to what is happening now, because when President Putin came in, he was not anti-European,
*  he was not anti-American. What he saw, though, was the incredible arrogance of the United States,
*  the expansion of NATO, the wars in Iraq, the covert war in Syria, the war in Libya against
*  the U.N. resolution. So we created so much of what we're facing right now through our own
*  ineptitude and arrogance. There was no linear determination. It was step-by-step U.S. arrogance
*  that has helped to bring us to where we are today.
*  Thank you.
