As the war on Gaza enters its second year and Israel expands its attacks on Lebanon, we speak with the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. His new book The Message is based in part on his visit last year to Israel and the occupied West Bank, where he says he saw a system of segregation and oppression reminiscent of Jim Crow in the United States. "It was revelatory," says Coates. "I don't think the average American has a real sense of what we're doing over there — and I emphasize 'what we're doing' because it's not possible without American support."

# Ta-Nehisi Coates I Was Told Palestine Was Complicated. Visiting Revealed a Simple, Brutal Truth
**Democracy Now:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTs70cNcmVo)
*  This news is funded by viewers like you.
*  Please support our work at democracynow.org.
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman with Juan González.
*  Last night, here in New York, hundreds of activists, Jewish and Jewish allies and Palestinians,
*  rallied in Union Square for a vigil on the first anniversary of October 7th.
*  To mourn Israelis and Palestinians who've been killed.
*  And to call for an end to the Israeli massacre in Gaza and beyond.
*  People performed prayers, there were rabbis there, and they read out the names of those
*  who've lost their lives.
*  One of those who spoke I talked to afterwards, Eva Bergwort.
*  She is a spokesperson for the group, If Not Now.
*  Right now, people are wearing signs that say, no U.S. money for bombs.
*  And talk about the motto of this October 7th vigil.
*  So, the motto is, Every Life a Universe.
*  And it's from Pikuach Nefesh, which says that to destroy a life is to destroy an entire
*  world and to save a life is to save an entire world.
*  And our government is not treating every single life as a universe.
*  They're treating Palestinian lives as less sacred.
*  How did you get so involved with this issue?
*  I got involved through the Ferguson uprising.
*  And I was watching black and Palestinian activists trading tips on Twitter about how to deal
*  with tear gas.
*  And it became clear that Palestinians in the West Bank are facing a military charged with
*  policing and black Americans are facing a militarized police force.
*  And that was my entry point where I said I need to organize my community, which was unable
*  to show or which was limited in being able to show up for the civil rights fight of our
*  time for the Black Lives Matter movement because they were upset about the messaging for a
*  free Palestine in those protests.
*  And so I've spent the last 10 years of my life working on building the movement of Jewish
*  Americans who are calling for equality, justice and a thriving future for all, no matter where
*  people live.
*  That's Eva Bergward of the group If Not Now, one of hundreds of people here in New
*  York City and Union Square for two large rallies on the anniversary of October 7th.
*  Our guest today is Ta-Nehisi Coates, the prize-winning journalist and author of the new book The
*  Message, in part about a visit he took last year organized by the Palestine Festival of
*  literature, Powfest, to the West Bank and Israel.
*  Talk about this whole journey you took.
*  You were part of the Powfest and then you also stayed.
*  Yeah, and I guess to be honest, my journey began 10 years ago when I published the case
*  for reparations.
*  And there was a section, again, as a writer, as a journalist, you're always trying to
*  make people feel things, make things real.
*  And there was a section where I offered an analog for reparations, for how it could possibly
*  look and it was from West Germany to the state of Israel.
*  And I need to be very specific about that, not to Holocaust survivors, but to the state
*  of Israel itself.
*  And that part of that essay came under quite a bit of critique.
*  And what became clear to me was deservedly so.
*  It took 10 years for me to get it fixed because writing takes a long time.
*  But I knew that I was going to have to go at some point.
*  I knew it wouldn't be enough for me to appear at a rally, do a slogan, whatever.
*  And long story short, I began talking to Powfest in 2016, finally got there in 2023, just in
*  time for The Message.
*  I spent five days with them, mostly traveling through the occupied territories and through
*  East Jerusalem as a Palestinian would, getting a sense of what their daily life was.
*  And then the next five days, I spent mostly in the company of a group called Breaking
*  the Silence, former IDF veterans who are against the occupation.
*  And I saw the country largely through the views of an Israeli, how they move through
*  the world, how they move through Jerusalem, how they move through the roads.
*  But I also, again, spent a lot of time actually talking more to Palestinians.
*  It was revelatory.
*  I don't think the average American has a real sense of what we're doing over there.
*  And I emphasize what we're doing, because it's not possible without American support.
*  I have heard people say over and over again that there are great evils happening in the
*  world, states across the world perpetrating evils against whole groups of people.
*  Why pick on Israel?
*  And the thing I say is, I'm an American.
*  This is the thing that we have our fingerprints on, those bombs over Gaza, the planes that
*  drop bombs on Gaza, the plaques that I saw, for instance, in Jerusalem.
*  All of that is America.
*  And we are going around the world, propping ourselves up as the front of democracy.
*  We are going around the world, propping Israel up as the only democracy in Middle East.
*  This is a deep, deep fiction, a very, very dangerous fiction that must be addressed.
*  And that's what I tried to do in the book.
*  You write in the book a quote,
*  It occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage
*  that resembled the world that my parents were born into.
*  Can you elaborate?
*  Yes.
*  And I think I talked about it the last time I was here, actually.
*  These are the words I have, even now.
*  And they are probably insufficient to what a Palestinian would offer who experiences
*  this.
*  But the words that come to me are segregation.
*  When you are on the West Bank, there are separate roads.
*  There are roads for Israeli settlers and citizens of Israel, and there are roads for Palestinians.
*  These roads are not separate and equal.
*  These roads tend to be separate and unequal.
*  It tends to take longer to get where you want to go if you're a Palestinian.
*  If you enter a city like Hebron, for instance, Hebron is quite literally segregated.
*  There are streets that Palestinians cannot walk down.
*  There are streets that Israeli settlers are given complete and free movement of, moving
*  throughout the West Bank in general.
*  There are checkpoints everywhere for Palestinians.
*  These checkpoints are sometimes normal checkpoints that they know are there.
*  Sometimes checkpoints appear out of the blue, what they call flying checkpoints.
*  Your basic movement is constantly in peril.
*  The justice system, which is deeply familiar for African Americans here, is quite literally
*  segregated.
*  There is a civil justice system that the minority of Israeli settlers as Israeli citizens enjoy.
*  And then there is an entirely separate justice system that Palestinians on the West Bank
*  are subject to.
*  You can be arrested, for instance, as an Israeli citizen, and you are, you know, due all the
*  due rights that we are familiar with.
*  You have to be told what the charges are, et cetera.
*  If you are arrested as a Palestinian, you can just be taken.
*  In another political context, we would call those hostages, because nobody has to say
*  why you're taken.
*  Nobody has to say what you were taken for.
*  Nobody has to inform your family.
*  It has been this way since 1967.
*  And the word we use for that is occupation, which is a kind of deeply vanilla word that
*  does not actually describe what is going on, how a country that maintains this separate
*  and unequal system, how a country that does not even allow the quote-unquote Palestinian
*  citizens of the state full equality with its Jewish Israeli citizens is allowed to
*  refer to itself as a democracy is a mystery to me.
*  And the closest analog I can think of is the time in which the United States of America
*  referred to itself as a democracy, even as it was disenfranchising whole swaths of black
*  people in the southern states.
*  And so when I say Jim Crow, when I say segregation, that is because that is the period that immediately
*  comes to mind for me.
*  Talk about being stopped by an Israeli soldier, Ta-Nehisi.
*  Oh.
*  Well, we were stopped all the time, to be clear, because we were on the roads.
*  We were constantly stopped.
*  You know, I was—you just kind of got used to it after a while, which was also weirdly
*  familiar.
*  But I think the instance you're referring to is when I was in Hebron, which is a flashpoint
*  for anybody that's been over there.
*  I was walking down the street attempting to patronize a Palestinian vendor, and a guard,
*  an IDF guard or IDF soldier stopped out.
*  He was young enough to be my son, stopped out and asked me what was my religion.
*  It was clear that I had to state my religion in order to pass.
*  When I told him that I was not religious, he asked what my mother's religion was.
*  When I told him my mother wasn't particularly religious, he asked what my grandmother's
*  religion was.
*  And this is a very, very important thing, because when you start asking what my mother
*  religion is and grandmother's religion is, you are referring to something beyond do I
*  accept Christ as my personal savior or what God I pray to.
*  You are asking a deeper question about my ancestry.
*  And it became clear that if I did not give the right answer to that question, I would
*  not be allowed to pass.
*  I highlight this because when you hear Palestinian and Palestinian-American activists make the
*  charge of racism, this is what they're talking about.
*  Why does who my grandmother or my mother worship matter if we're strictly talking about a
*  God?
*  Not that it would be right even in that sense.
*  But when you hear the charge of racism, this is what people are referring to.
*  Tana Hasee, this is a powerful book, and you went on CBS this morning recently to talk
*  about the publication of it.
*  And I want to go to that interview on CBS this morning.
*  The New York Times is now reporting, CBS News has rebuked one of the morning anchors.
*  Tony DeCoppola, over what he did in that interview to you.
*  And maybe you could also say to his fellow anchors as he dominated this.
*  CBS executives said the interview fell short of the network's editorial standards.
*  This is an excerpt of that interview.
*  Tana Hasee, I want to dive into the Israel-Palestine section of the book.
*  It's the largest section of the book.
*  And I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took
*  away the awards and the acclaim, took the cover off the book, the publishing house goes
*  away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.
*  And so then I found myself wondering, why does Tana Hasee Coates, who I've known for
*  a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much?
*  Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it?
*  Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it?
*  Why not detail anything of the first and the second intifada, the cafe bombings, the bus
*  bombings, the little kids blown to bits?
*  And is it because you just don't believe that Israel, in any condition, has a right to exist?
*  Well, I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that
*  perspective in American media.
*  That's the first thing I would say.
*  I am most concerned always with those who don't have a voice, with those who don't have
*  the ability to talk.
*  I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network mainstream organization
*  in America with a Palestinian American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a
*  voice to articulate their part of the world.
*  I've been a reporter for 20 years.
*  The reporters of those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't
*  have a problem getting their voice out.
*  But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel,
*  what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories that I have not heard.
*  So, Ta-Nehisi, you sitting on the set of CBS this morning with the former football player,
*  Nate Burleson, Gail King, very well known, both African American anchors, and Tony DeCoppo.
*  He dominated the discussion talking about your book could be found in an extremist backpack.
*  Talk about the backlash on this, the aftermath of this, and also who you felt was most wronged
*  in this.
*  Well, it wasn't me.
*  I mean, at that point, let me tell you, it was not me, you know.
*  And I don't know if there was anybody on that set.
*  Look, I think there is a meta conversation that happens here, where we end up, because
*  we're media, where we end up talking about media and media politics.
*  But I do think it's really important to broaden the frame from the few people that were there
*  and talk about what was actually excluded and who was actually excluded from that conversation
*  by the very structure itself.
*  I just don't want to lose sight of that.
*  I don't really have a problem with a tough interview.
*  You know, I knew what I wrote.
*  You know, I knew I'd be confronted.
*  I'd, you know, was he rude?
*  Was he aggressive?
*  You know, I like, I can't really get into that.
*  Like, it's not really something that I think too much about.
*  The question I would ask, though, is how often on CBS, on NBC, on ABC, or any major news
*  organization, do you see someone who is a defender of the Israeli state project get
*  confronted in that kind of way?
*  Get given a tough interview in that kind of way.
*  When was the last time you saw, for instance, a defender of Israel, a defender of Zionism,
*  confronted with the fact that major human rights organizations say that Israel is practicing
*  apartheid?
*  How do you defend that?
*  When is the last time you've seen an interviewer?
*  How often do you see interviews?
*  Because I don't want to say it never happens.
*  How often do you see interviewers say, listen, we have, you know, the former head of Human
*  Rights Watch.
*  You are practicing genocide right now in Gaza.
*  How do you respond to that?
*  How often do you say that?
*  How often do you see, how do you define yourself as a democracy when fully half the people
*  under your rule are not equal?
*  There is no problem with confronting me.
*  You know, I would like to see some other people confronted.
*  And the second part of that is who gets to do the confronting in the first place.
*  I have said, and I will continue to say, I am a little uncomfortable with this role and
*  a little uncomfortable with the publicity, not because I feel like I do not know, but
*  because I feel like there are people who are going through this experience and who have
*  gone through this experience who know so much more, who are completely out of the frame.
*  And those are Palestinians and Palestinian Americans.
*  So it's not just the issues that I raise in the confrontation.
*  The question I would ask is, you have to imagine a world where a Palestinian American journalist
*  could be on a mainstream show like CBS This Morning and confront someone who wrote a book
*  that say defended Israel or defended Zionism with that kind of aggression.
*  It's fine if I get it, but I want to live in that world too.
*  You know, and that really is, you know, like one of the things I was really, really trying
*  to get at in the book, in the message, you know, it's the questions we ask.
*  It's the stories we get to tell and the stories that we don't tell.
*  And perhaps most importantly, it's who gets to tell them and who doesn't.
*  And I just, I really feel this passionately.
*  This is not about me.
*  This is not about Tony.
*  This is not about Gail.
*  This is not about me.
*  We're going to be fine.
*  It's the people who are invisible.
*  It's the people who were not in that set, you know, on that set to begin with, who are
*  not part of that conversation.
*  And Ta-Nehisi, this criticism that you weren't sufficiently taking into account the history,
*  the reality is, here we are on the anniversary of the October 7th attacks and very little
*  discussion occurs about what was Gaza like before October 7th of last year and how were
*  the residents of Gaza being treated essentially in an open air prison?
*  Yes, no, I completely agree.
*  I love that the young lady who was saying earlier in the lead-in, every life is a uniform.
*  I truly, truly believe that.
*  And so, you know, as I've said before, like, there really is no part of my politics that
*  has the ability to look at October 7th and not mourn the death, the massacre, the atrocities
*  perpetrated.
*  I just wish that some of my countrymen, especially my countrymen, especially Americans who are
*  responsible for this, who are propping this up, had that same sort of compassion and that
*  same sort of energy for October 6th, October 5th, etc.
*  You know, this kind of abstracting events outside, you know, of their historical context
*  is really necessary to the political order because it allows us to justify ourselves
*  and not have to think harder and not have to ask, you know, much deeper questions.
*  You really have to be able to hold both.
*  And I know that sounds a bit cliché, but I truly do believe that you have to believe
*  in this idea that I actually just heard today, that every life is a universe.
*  I think that's a really, really beautiful articulation, you know?
*  And that has to be true for all life.
*  That has to be true on October 7th, you know, and loudly said, but it has to be true on
*  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 also.
*  And also, I wanted to go back for a second because we are running out of time and ask
*  you about...
*  I'm sorry my answers are so long.
*  Yeah, about President Trump and the upcoming election.
*  The great surprise to me of these years now is the enormous support that Donald Trump
*  still has among huge swaths of the American public.
*  So what do you attribute this?
*  Darkness.
*  There's a darkness in all of us.
*  I mean, this is not new, you know?
*  And if you just took American history from the perspective of an African American, and
*  I suspect from the perspective of the indigenous people of this continent, what they would
*  tell you is there is nothing new in people using power and people using, you know, the
*  worst tropes in the world to win and to dominate.
*  For any black person that grew up in the South from, I don't know, 1876 to 1964 and probably
*  beyond of being very conservative by saying that, this is what politics was.
*  Like this is just what we grew up under.
*  And so I think maybe we thought or we allowed ourselves to believe that somehow we had escaped
*  the gravity of history.
*  But no people.
*  No country escapes the gravity of history.
*  We live within it.
*  We are part of it.
*  And so, you know, I think it's a very, very dangerous thing that our leaders led us to
*  believe in 2016 that this was like a thing that could not happen in America, you know?
*  Whereas had we looked at history from another perspective, we would know that this actually
*  is very American, you know?
*  That doesn't make us, you know, inhuman or somehow demonically evil.
*  On the contrary, it just makes us human.
*  It means that we're subject to, you know, the darkness in our souls like any other
*  group of people would be.
*  Tanase, I wanted to go to that point you say of who gets heard.
*  We were at the Democratic convention, everywhere we were interviewing people.
*  We saw you in the background.
*  We were interviewing the delegate from, what, Michigan, from Florida and from Connecticut,
*  who unfurled a banner in the Florida delegation that said, stop arming Israel.
*  You were there as we were interviewing them in the hallway.
*  When we were outside, when they were about to begin the sleep-in overnight demanding
*  that Kamala Harris allow a Palestinian-American to speak, you were there.
*  And then the next day, and you wrote a piece in Vanity Fair about your experience, a Palestinian-American's
*  place under the Democrats' big tent, the piece looking at the uncommitted movement
*  and their unsuccessful efforts to have such a speaker.
*  This is Ruwa Roman of the Uncommitted Movement.
*  She's a Palestinian-American, Georgia state representative.
*  This is part of what she would have said if she was chosen.
*  For 320 days, we've stood together demanding to enforce our laws on friend and foe alike
*  to reach a ceasefire and the killing of Palestinians, free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages
*  and to begin the difficult work of building a path to collective peace and safety.
*  That's why we are here, members of this Democratic Party committed to equal rights and dignity
*  for all.
*  What we do here echoes around the world.
*  They'll say this is how it's always been, that nothing can change.
*  But remember, Fannie Lou Hamer shunned for her courage, yet she paved the way for an
*  integrated Democratic Party.
*  Her legacy lives on, and it's her example we follow.
*  So that's Georgia state representative Ruwa Roman.
*  And needless to say, there was not a Palestinian-American voice on the stage.
*  Last night, Kamala Harris did an interview with 60 Minutes.
*  At least they played it last night.
*  This is what she had to say about Israel-Palestine.
*  When we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is,
*  without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself
*  against those kinds of attacks.
*  Now the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit
*  around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the
*  need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages
*  and create a ceasefire.
*  And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the
*  region, including Arab leaders.
*  That's Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris speaking on 60 Minutes last night.
*  As we wrap up, you were just talking about Trump.
*  What the position of the Biden-Harris administration is right now.
*  They did hold two separate commemorations yesterday.
*  President Biden was at the White House and he lit a candle and also I think crossed himself
*  right after.
*  And Kamala Harris, the vice president and the Naval Observatory, planted a tree, a pomegranate
*  tree.
*  Well, you know, that's good and appropriate.
*  Like I said, we don't want to have a politic that does not take life serious and does not
*  take loss of life serious.
*  On the larger question, and maybe even as an extension of that, but we have to take
*  all life seriously, I don't think we're doing that.
*  This is morally untenable.
*  What I saw was, and this is the first time I've ever said this or put this in this frame,
*  and maybe the uncommitted delegates understood this, there was as much a moral gap between
*  what I saw in Chicago.
*  That is to say, to go on stage and promote these values of diversity, humanity, big tent,
*  and to exclude the peoples whose families are being bombed right now, as it was in the
*  early 1960s and before, when the Democratic Party claimed to be for the working man and
*  the working person, while millions of workers all through the South were effectively in
*  a system of indentured servitude, and they refused to give those people political representation.
*  It is a gigantic moral gulf that is troubling, disappointing, heartbreaking, and deeply,
*  deeply personally upsetting.
*  Tana Hasekot's award-winning journalist, author, professor, his new book is The Message.
*  That does it for our show.
*  I'm Amy Goodman in New York with Juan González in Chicago.
