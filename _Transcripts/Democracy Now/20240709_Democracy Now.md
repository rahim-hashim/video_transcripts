With the war on Gaza now in its 10th month, we speak with journalist Jeremy Scahill about the state of negotiations for a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Scahill recently spoke to senior Hamas officials about the ongoing ceasefire negotiations and the group’s broader goals. He is a co-founder of The Intercept, and he recently announced he was leaving after more than a decade to launch a new investigative journalism outlet, Drop Site News, alongside colleague Ryan Grim. Scahill’s new article, “On the Record with Hamas,” examines the militant group’s motivations to launch the October 7 attacks in Israel, as well as its stance on the negotiations, based on interviews with a number of senior Hamas officials and other sources. “October 7 didn’t happen in a vacuum,” says Scahill. “The primary motivation, Hamas members told me, was to try to shatter the status quo on Gaza. They felt that the situation was becoming untenable.”

# “On the Record with Hamas”: Jeremy Scahill Speaks with Hamas About Oct. 7, Ceasefire Talks & Israel
**Democracy Now:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc4atK6DzpM)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I'm Amy Goodman.
*  As we continue to look at Israel's war on Gaza, we turn now to look at the state of
*  negotiations for a possible ceasefire and hostage deal.
*  On Monday, CIA Director William Burns and President Biden's top Middle East adviser
*  Brett McGurk met with Israeli and Egyptian officials in Cairo.
*  Burns is headed next to Qatar.
*  This comes as Hamas's political leadership has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu of jeopardizing talks by intensifying its war on Gaza.
*  In a statement released Monday, Hamas said, quote,
*  Netanyahu's placing more obstacles to the negotiations escalating his aggression and
*  crimes against our people and increasing his attempts to forcibly displace them to hinder
*  all efforts to reach an agreement, unquote.
*  Hamas's comment comes as multiple news outlets report Hamas has dropped its demand that
*  Israel first agree to a permanent ceasefire before any agreement is signed.
*  We're joined now by the prize-winning investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill.
*  He has a new article today, headlined On the Record with Hamas.
*  It examines Hamas's motivations to launch the October 7 attacks in Israel, as well as
*  Hamas's stance on the negotiations.
*  The article is based on interviews with a number of senior Hamas officials and other
*  sources, as well as an Israeli negotiator.
*  Jeremy's article appears on DropSite News.
*  That's an investigative news site that has just been launched with Ryan Grim.
*  On Monday, Jeremy and Ryan announced they were leaving The Intercept, which Jeremy co-founded
*  11 years ago.
*  Jeremy Scahill joins us now from Germany.
*  Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Jeremy.
*  Why don't we start off with your article and talk about what's happening now with
*  these, what looks like a new intensity with the negotiations that are taking place from
*  Egypt to Qatar?
*  Yeah, well, Amy, you know, I've spent the past couple of months talking with officials
*  from Hamas, some of them on background, some of them on the record.
*  I also just returned from a reporting trip to the region, and I'm going to be doing more
*  reporting in the coming days on this.
*  But I think it's important to emphasize that October 7th didn't happen in a vacuum.
*  You know, often when American officials talk about what Hamas refers to as operational
*  oxaflood, it's characterized as Hamas shattered the peace.
*  The reality is that for 76 years, there has been no true peace for the Palestinian people
*  in general, and certainly not for the people of Gaza.
*  In the past 17 years, they've lived in an open air prison where they've been subjected
*  to calorie restricted diet, to sanctions, a blockade, regular airstrikes by the Israeli
*  military and a tactic that Israel calls mowing the lawn.
*  And prior to October 7th, you had a number of factors at play.
*  The primary motivation, Hamas members told me, was to try to shatter the status quo on
*  Gaza.
*  They felt that the situation was becoming untenable.
*  Israel's strategy of collective punishment was aimed at trying to force local people
*  in Gaza to rise up against Hamas.
*  And indeed, there were indications in public opinion polling that people were growing increasingly
*  frustrated with Hamas, which is not just an armed insurgency movement or a resistance
*  movement, but also was a governing authority.
*  But it was beyond just the horrifying conditions in Gaza and the sort of sense of hopelessness
*  Under President Trump, the United States initiated a series of diplomatic agreements that they
*  referred to as the Abraham Accords.
*  And essentially, what that amounted to was the United States trying to broker bilateral
*  agreements between Arab and Muslim nations and Israel.
*  And for 20 years, the status quo on any agreements with Arab nations had to include a resolution
*  of the Palestinian question and the question of a Palestinian state.
*  And what Trump and company did was to embrace Netanyahu's idea that the Palestinians should
*  not be given a veto over a relationship with other Arab nations.
*  And so when you combine that with the expansion of the annexations, with the ongoing tensions
*  at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holiest site in Islam that exists in Palestine, and you look
*  at the horrifying conditions in Gaza, Hamas's perspective was, we need to shatter all of
*  this.
*  And we don't believe that negotiation with Israel is going to be effective.
*  They invoke other revolutionary and resistance movements throughout history and gave a full
*  throated defense, even with the consequences that we've seen in a minimum of 40,000 Palestinians
*  killed, but likely much, much higher than that.
*  Jermia, I wanted to turn to a clip.
*  I think it was like eight days before the October 7th attacks last year.
*  This is a clip of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan speaking.
*  Jake Sullivan, National Security Adviser
*  When we came into office, you had the war in Yemen raging as the world's largest humanitarian
*  catastrophe.
*  You had, a few months before we came in, our embassy in Baghdad stormed and Secretary of
*  State Pompeo going out and talking about pulling the entire American mission out of Iraq.
*  You had Iranian groups in both Syria and Iraq firing missiles at U.S. forces.
*  All of that's what we walked into.
*  And what we said is we want to depressurize, de-escalate, and ultimately integrate the
*  Middle East region.
*  The war in Yemen is in.
*  It's 19 months of truce.
*  For now, the Iranian attacks against U.S. forces have stopped.
*  Our presence in Iraq is stable.
*  I emphasize for now because all of that can change.
*  And the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.
*  AMY GOODMAN That's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan
*  speaking at the Atlantic Magazine Festival at the end of September 2023.
*  Jeremy Scahill, your response, and in speaking with Hamas officials, talk about their response.
*  JEREMY SCAHILL Well, let's remember that in May of 2021,
*  Israel engaged in an 11-day heavy bombing campaign against Gaza.
*  And at the heart of that was the attempt to evict people from the Jerusalem—occupied
*  East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, as well as clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
*  where the Netanyahu government was effectively allowing Israeli settlers and others to come
*  and, in the views of Palestinians, sort of defile this holy site.
*  And so Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched a series of rockets into Israeli
*  territory.
*  About a dozen Israeli civilians were killed.
*  Netanyahu responded with a heavy bombardment, in which several hundred Palestinians were
*  killed.
*  And Joe Biden, who was very early in his presidency, fully endorsed that.
*  But he did eventually say, OK, the runway is up.
*  He calls Netanyahu.
*  And two days later, Netanyahu engages in a brokered ceasefire with Egypt—with Hamas,
*  but via Egypt.
*  And in the two years between those airstrikes in 2021 and the launch of Al-Aqsa Flood on
*  October 7, Hamas was watching the Biden administration.
*  And they watched how Biden picked up the mantle from Trump on the Abraham Accords and
*  started moving forward.
*  And also the fact that it really did seem—and I think this goes beyond the walls of Gaza
*  and into broader Palestinian community in historic Palestine, but also in the world—that
*  the United States and others were presiding over a definitive decay of the aspiration
*  for a Palestinian state.
*  And they, from their perspective, this was in the epic history of Israel-Palestine, the
*  opening salvo in what they hoped would be the definitive battle that would call the
*  question on the existence of the state of Palestine.
*  If we can fast forward, though, to what you were talking about earlier with the negotiations,
*  I spoke to members of Hamas's delegation that are right at this moment engaged in these
*  negotiations. And what they said is they've noticed over recent weeks that the U.S.
*  negotiators appear to be growing increasingly frustrated with Israel.
*  Now, of course, there's this whole fiction about how Biden is so frustrated with his
*  great, great friend Benjamin Netanyahu. That's not what they're referring to. They're talking
*  about on a tactical level that the United States negotiators, William Burns and others,
*  seem to really be fed up and wanting to make a deal.
*  And that's why I think it came as somewhat of a shock to people when, over the weekend,
*  Netanyahu leaked to the media, according to Israeli news organizations, his four non-negotiables.
*  And among them was he reserves the right to continue pummeling Gaza until he achieves
*  total victory. From Hamas's perspective, they also feel that they have their red lines.
*  While the fact remains that an enormous number of Palestinians have been slaughtered with U.S.
*  weapons in this genocidal war, the insurgency, the armed groups, Islamic Jihad and Hamas,
*  have waged a war of attrition against Israeli occupation forces. They've killed
*  a large number of Israeli troops. They've blown up tanks. Despite the fact that they're
*  characterized as rats hiding in tunnels, they've proven very effective at delivering
*  serious blows to the Israeli occupation forces. And Hamas is also keenly aware of the fact that
*  Netanyahu is under immense pressure inside of Israel because of the issue of the hostages.
*  And his insistence that they're going to liberate Israelis that are being held in
*  Gaza by military force has proven very deadly for the hostages themselves.
*  And so what I think we're seeing here is this utter hubris of Netanyahu, where he believes
*  that it's justifiable to link his personal political fate to the release of Israelis
*  who are being held. I think that's the perspective in Israel right now.
*  From Hamas's perspective, I don't think that they're willing to take the idea of a permanent
*  ceasefire off the table. What I've been told by sources is that they're willing to engage in what
*  they call an incremental series of agreements. And one of the prime demands beyond an end to
*  the genocidal war that Hamas is putting forward is they want more prisoners released. There are
*  thousands of Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons and jails and administrative detention.
*  Yes, they want the civilians, the women and children that Israel is holding, to be released.
*  But they also want prisoners that Israel calls the impossibles, people who are armed resistance
*  figures, some of whom have been convicted of murdering Israelis. Israel has said they will
*  not release Palestinians with Jewish blood on their hands. Hamas is insisting that they also
*  get to have their combatants returned if Israel wants its soldiers back. So there are huge issues
*  here. And the final thing I'll say is, remember, Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza-based head of Hamas,
*  who is widely believed to be one of the three main organizers of Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th,
*  himself spent nearly 23 years in an Israeli prison. And he was released in 2011 in a massive
*  prisoner exchange where more than 1,000 Palestinians were freed from Israeli jails
*  in return for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. So Hamas officials all emphasized to me that one
*  of the primary goals of their operations on October 7th was to take as many soldiers that they could
*  back to Gaza because they believed that that was the only way to free high-value prisoners,
*  including Marwan Barghouti, who is not a member of Hamas. He's Fatah, but he is widely viewed as the
*  top Palestinian who could unify the Palestinian cause and move forward in the effort to achieve
*  an independent, unified Palestinian state. In Jeremy Scahill, the Israeli newspaper
*  Haaretz has revealed new details about how Israeli military officials ordered repeated attacks
*  inside Israel on October 7th in an effort to prevent Hamas from taking hostages into Gaza.
*  It remains unknown how many Israelis killed on that day were actually killed by Israeli forces
*  implementing what is known as the Hannibal Directive. One military source told Haaretz,
*  quote, the instruction was to turn the area of the fence into an extermination zone to close
*  the line of contact towards the West. Can you elaborate on this?
*  Yeah. I mean, one thing that Hamas officials that I've spoken with and have talked to others
*  have emphasized, and you can take this with a grain of salt, but this is their position.
*  They're saying that they did not go into Israel with the intent to engage in the mass killing
*  of civilians. And they have their own definition of civilian that doesn't include male settlers.
*  And so you have to kind of go down a rabbit hole to fully understand what they're saying. But
*  what I think is relevant is that Hamas is saying, look, a lot of people got killed in crossfire
*  when we were battling against both armed settlers and Israeli military and police forces. And this
*  has been covered extensively in the Israeli media. There was a case in Kibbutz Biri where about a
*  dozen Israeli civilians were killed in a shelling by Israeli tanks of a house that there were
*  Palestinian gunmen in. And Yasmin Porat, one of the survivors of that, has been very outspoken.
*  Look, also independent news outlets that have covered this crisis for a long time,
*  like Electronic Intifada and Mando Weiss, Ali Abunimah, they said from the beginning that it
*  appeared that at least some form of a Hannibal doctrine-style operation was unleashed, and they
*  were ridiculed for it, and people were dismissing it. And now it seems clear—we don't know the
*  extent to which this was implemented—that a fair number of Israelis were in fact killed by their
*  own forces, either in so-called friendly fire incidents or, as Haaretz is indicating, deliberately
*  to prevent hostages from being taken back to Gaza.
*  AMY GOODMAN Can you talk about what happened to the so-called spotters? These were women,
*  Israeli soldiers, and their warnings to their higher-ups and what happened before October 7th.
*  A number of them killed, some taken hostage.
*  AARON MATEY Yeah, and you know, your previous guest was alluding to some of this as well.
*  We're learning, and I think we only understand a fraction of the intelligence warnings that were
*  delivered to the highest echelons of power in Israel. But we've known for months that there were
*  primarily female intelligence analysts that were basically sounding the alarms up their chain of
*  command, that it appeared as though Hamas and other organizations were engaged in a specific
*  sort of training exercise that looked like it was mimicking the kind of assaults that we then
*  ultimately saw unfold on October 7th. There's some indication, as your guest was saying,
*  that the U.S. may have also provided intelligence. And when you look at this
*  trail of crumbs of clues, it's very difficult to rule out that somewhere, at some point within
*  the Israeli security apparatus, someone was aware of this and decided that they didn't want to take
*  it seriously. I'm not engaged in conspiracy theorizing about any of this, but there is
*  a huge scandal, I think, that is going to continue to unfold in Israel.
*  And many Israelis are asking that question. Look, Israel is a nuclear power, armed, funded,
*  supported, bankrolled, backed by the United States of America. It has promoted an image of itself
*  around the world that it can reach its enemies wherever they are and assassinate them and take
*  them out. And that all crumbled on October 7th. When you had guys that are making sniper rifles
*  and buying equipment that you can get on Amazon, and they're taking out surveillance towers with
*  their low-end quality drones and using paragliders to go in or doing amphibious assault landings,
*  the idea that a modern military that is bankrolled, armed, and funded by the United States was not able
*  to repel that force raises a lot of questions that I think Israeli society is going to be
*  grappling with for quite some time. In your piece, you quote Rashid Khalidi,
*  the renowned Columbia University professor, now retired, author of the Hundred Years War
*  on Palestine, widely viewed as the leading U.S. historian of Palestine. He talked about the massive
*  civilian death toll in Gaza. He said to you, quote, These deaths should be on the conscience
*  of the Israeli leaders who decided to kill all these people, but they also, to some extent,
*  should be on the consciences of people who organized the October 7th operation. They should
*  have known and had to have known that Israel would inflict devastating revenge not just on them,
*  but mainly on the civilian population. Do you credit them for this? The end result may be the
*  permanent occupation, immiseration, and perhaps even expulsion of the population of Gaza, in which
*  case I don't think anybody would want to credit whoever organized this operation. Your response,
*  Jeremy? Yeah, I mean, one of the things I was trying to do in this reporting was to explore
*  the breadth of perspectives on this question of, you know, on the one hand, I don't think that
*  anybody who has a reasonable grasp of the history would deny that the Palestinian people have a
*  right to resist and that Israel and the international community have sent a message to Palestinians that
*  even nonviolent resistance is going to be met with force, as happened in 2018 and 2019
*  in the nonviolent demonstrations at the barriers of Gaza, where Israeli snipers had a competition
*  to see how many unarmed protesters they could shoot in the knee. So I don't think that there
*  is, there can really be any reasonable debate about whether or not the Palestinians have a
*  right to resist. This is a tactical question. Should Hamas have been able to predict that
*  the response from Israel was going to be far beyond any of the other recent bombing campaigns?
*  And I heard different answers from people within Hamas. Some said, look, we thought,
*  we knew that it was going to be a heavy response. We knew that a lot of people were going to die.
*  This is the nature of how Israel responds to our legitimate resistance. But we did not imagine that
*  it was going to be more than kind of what happened in 2014 or 2021, but maybe on some steroids.
*  But there were other officials that said no one within Hamas predicted that it was going to be
*  this scale of a genocidal war. So there isn't necessarily a party line on this. I got the
*  sense that this is a question also that Hamas itself is debating, because there are going to
*  be people that are going to confront them with these questions within Gaza itself.
*  There's an interesting dynamic that has played out, though, where you see Hamas' popularity and
*  also Islamic Jihad, the idea of armed resistance against Israel. In polls, it indicates that beyond
*  Gaza and other parts of Palestine and in the diaspora, that support for armed insurgency and
*  attacks against Israel has gone up. Hamas' political standing has certainly gone up in both the West
*  Bank and in Gaza. But whether that's going to translate into political power is a different
*  issue. Susan Abouhawa, who is a famous Palestinian novelist and activist who's been twice to Gaza,
*  she's also been on Democracy Now!, also was talking about this. And she said, yeah, when you
*  talk to people on the ground in Gaza, certainly some of them are saying very critical things about
*  Hamas, but everyone knows who's bombing them. And I think in a way this discussion becomes a trap
*  of sorts, because the fact is that the United States has enthusiastically backed and armed and
*  bankrolled a genocide for nine straight months. Joe Biden, his career has been marked by unapologetic
*  defense of Israel at its most extreme. I think that what is clear right now is that this is the
*  moment when the world needs to address in a definitive way the demands by Palestinians
*  for decades to have an independent, unified Palestinian state, because the Israeli negotiator
*  Gershon Baskin told me also, this has to be the last war. Israel is not going to survive if this
*  goes on. So even from his perspective, he wants this to be the end of it. There's big questions
*  about Biden pushing this notion of a two-state solution. I've heard different things from Hamas
*  individuals. Hamas does not want a two-state solution. They want a one-state solution, a unified
*  Palestine. But their official position is that if it's the democratic will of the Palestinian people,
*  they will accept a two-state arrangement along the 1967 border lines. But they also point out,
*  tell me where the borders of the current state of Israel even are, because of all of the illegal
*  annexations, the expansion, the land grabs, the expulsion of Palestinians from land that the whole
*  world recognizes as Palestinian territory. This is not just rhetoric from Hamas. This is basic
*  facts that they're relaying. You mentioned Gershon Baskin, one of the Israeli negotiators
*  who helped to negotiate the release of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier, for 1,000 Palestinians who
*  were imprisoned. If you can talk about his perspective on this, he's been behind the
*  scene since October 7th, negotiating around hostage issues. And then I'd like you to talk
*  about who exactly Yahya Sinwar is. Gershon Baskin is a well-known Israeli
*  peace activist who Hamas has been willing to deal with him. And he did play a central role
*  in this massive exchange of Palestinians who were in prison for Gilad Shalit in 2011. And as I
*  mentioned earlier, this is how Yahya Sinwar won his freedom. Gershon Baskin also said, look,
*  on day four, after October 7th, that he was in touch with Hamas negotiators.
*  And what he said, which Hamas had been telling me, but Gershon Baskin confirmed it,
*  that many civilians who were taken inside of Israel were not, in fact, taken by Hamas and
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, but by other people who came in in second and third waves from Gaza.
*  These are people that have been imprisoned in what they view as a concentration camp for their
*  entire lives, for multi-generational reality has been living in this prison. And so people pour in,
*  and they're taking hostages back to Gaza, including children and the elderly, sick people.
*  And my understanding is that Hamas was not prepared for this, and they didn't imagine that so many
*  people were going to be taken back. And so on day four, October 11th, Gershon Baskin and others were
*  talking to Hamas, and Hamas was saying, we want to hand these people back to you immediately.
*  And they were asking for very little in return for it. They wanted them off their hands. Also,
*  they were having to run around and track down all of these people. And Baskin tried to negotiate
*  that. The Israelis said no. Yair Kassinwar, the head of Gaza, then some weeks later, said he wanted
*  to end the war by making a comprehensive deal for the release of every single person that had been
*  taken back to Gaza as a prisoner or a captive or a hostage in return for emptying the prisons of
*  Palestinians, and the Israeli government rejected it. Now, Israel will have its own perspective on
*  that and say, oh, this isn't what Hamas would really mean, or they're not sincere. But this
*  is just the factual timeline based on Hamas's perspective that's been confirmed by Gershon Baskin.
*  On the issue of Yair Kassinwar, this was a guy who soon after Hamas was formed in 1987, and he was
*  an original member of Hamas, which was in effect an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
*  Sinwar was arrested on allegations that he was essentially an internal hitman for Hamas
*  murdering collaborators with the Israelis. And Israel also was accusing him of plotting to murder
*  Israeli soldiers, but they snatched him, they put him on trial, and he was sentenced to multiple
*  life sentences in prison for allegations that he had murdered four Palestinians that had
*  collaborated with Israel. And he spent nearly 23 years in prison. And while in prison, he became
*  fluent in Hebrew, and actually he wrote a number of books inside of prison himself, including a novel
*  that was semi-autobiographical. But also he translated by hand the memoirs of some heads of
*  the Israeli intelligence agency from Hebrew into Arabic. He spent two decades studying Israeli
*  society, Israeli culture, the history of the Mossad, the history of Shin Bet. And then he's
*  released back into Gaza in 2011, and then eventually consolidates his authority. And he has
*  militantly insisted for years since he won his freedom that he views it as a moral issue to
*  release the rest of the Palestinian prisoners. And that is something that he has really emphasized
*  as a central goal of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. And he himself was one of those prisoners and was in
*  the negotiating committees in multiple rounds of negotiation from prison with the Israelis. So
*  he understands very, very well the mentality of his adversaries in this war. And I would say that
*  they also understand him very well also because intelligence operatives spent a lot of time
*  debriefing Yahya Sinwar or trying to play mental chess with him over those 22, 23 years in prison.
*  Jeremy, this is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar back in 2021 speaking to Vice News comparing the
*  Palestinian struggle to the police murder of George Floyd. But this was 2021. This is before
*  October 7th. They want to take this opportunity to remember the racist murder of George Floyd.
*  George Floyd was killed as a result of a racist ideology held by some people.
*  The same type of racism that killed George Floyd is being used by Israel against the Palestinians
*  in Jerusalem, the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, and in the West Bank, and by the burning of our children,
*  and against the Gaza Strip, through siege, murder and starvation.
*  That is Yahya Sinwar speaking back in 2021 to Vice News. Your final comment on this,
*  Jeremy, and then we want to talk about, as we talk about news organizations,
*  your new news organization, DropSight, DropSight News. You've just left The Intercept after
*  co-founding it 11 years ago. Yeah, I mean, I think what's important to emphasize here is that,
*  Sinwar and other Hamas officials are very sophisticated thinkers. This is not ISIS or
*  al-Qaeda. These are people that are very fluent in UN resolutions and international law. They know
*  how to make an argument in defense of what they say is revolutionary violence. Many of the Hamas
*  officials I talked to are veterinarians or doctors, deeply educated people. So Sinwar is clever,
*  and he is trying to appeal to an American population in the same sense that some of the
*  announced objectives of the October 7 attacks were probably not the most important or central
*  objectives to Hamas, but they want to emphasize those as a message to the broader Palestinian
*  population in the world or to Arab populations to hold their own governments accountable for doing
*  in the eyes of Hamas nothing to defend the Palestinian people.
*  Regarding DropSight News, it's not any secret that the world that we live in right now
*  has a lot of dark things going on. We urgently need shows like Democracy Now, institutions of
*  investigative journalism. And what Ryan and I are trying to do is build a lean, sustainable,
*  reader-supported news organization that's going to take big swings at powerful people,
*  that's going to work with networks of independent journalists on the ground in countries around the
*  world and inside of the United States, and to operate with no fear or favor of those in power,
*  whether they're Democrats or Republicans. Our pledge is to, as I know yours is, Amy,
*  and has been for a long time as a journalist, is to be accountable to the readers, the viewers,
*  and the listeners. And I just want to say on a personal level, I said this in my introductory
*  essay for DropSight News, I'm looking forward to returning to why I got into journalism.
*  And Democracy Now gave me that opportunity I'll never forget when you let me beg my way into
*  cutting reel-to-reel tape on the old-fashioned analog reels. And you taught me about the
*  temerity to ask tough questions and to never back down.
*  AMY GOODMAN And finally, Jeremy, why the name DropSight?
*  JEREMY BROWNE Well, DropSight is a term of espionage,
*  where it's a place where spies can leave a secret for one another. It's an agreed-upon location. It
*  also is a place where you can drop supplies behind enemy lines to resupply your forces.
*  It's also a place where you can drop documents. So, we're looking forward to working also with
*  whistleblowers.
*  AMY GOODMAN Jeremy Scahill,
*  co-founder of the new investigative journalism organization DropSight News.
*  I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.
