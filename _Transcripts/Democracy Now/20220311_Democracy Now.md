# Andrew Bacevich: Ukraine is Paying the Price for the U.S. “Recklessly” Pushing NATO Expansion
**Democracy Now!:** [March 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCntlkpdr0k)
*  This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
*  I am Amy Goodman.
*  As we continue to look at the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Senate has passed a $1.5
*  trillion spending bill that includes $13.6 billion for military and economic aid for
*  Ukraine, that—twice the original amount requested by the Biden administration.
*  This comes as the U.S. and NATO are pouring weapons into Ukraine to help counter the Russian
*  invasion.
*  The New York Times recently reported the U.S. and its allies sent 17,000 anti-tank weapons
*  to Ukraine over a recent six-day period.
*  The Washington Post reported the U.S. is quietly preparing plans to back a Ukrainian insurgency
*  and a government in exile if Russia succeeds in seizing Ukraine.
*  We're joined now by Andrzej Bacewicz, president and co-founder of the Anti-War Think Tank
*  and Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, retired Colonel, Vietnam War veteran, professor
*  emeritus of international relations and history at Boston University, author of a number of
*  books, including his most recent just out, called After the Apocalypse, America's Role
*  in a World Transformed.
*  His most recent pieces include one headlined, U.S. Can't Obsolve Itself of Responsibility
*  for Putin's Ukraine Invasion.
*  Mr. Bacewicz, let's begin there.
*  Talk about the U.S.-Putin connection and why you feel the U.S. is partially responsible
*  for what's taking place.
*  Well, I think I would describe it as a U.S.-Russia connection, because it's not necessarily
*  limited to Mr. Putin.
*  And the key issue here, I think, is when the Cold War ended.
*  When the Cold War ended, of course, Russia was in a position of great weakness and vulnerability.
*  And the United States and its allies chose to exploit that weakness.
*  The most vivid expression of that was the eastward expansion of NATO.
*  Let's remind ourselves NATO was an anti-Soviet alliance when it was created in 1949.
*  The expansion of NATO basically moved it up to the borders of post-Soviet Russia.
*  At that time, there were many Americans, George Kennan, the diplomat, would be perhaps the
*  most prominent, that warned against NATO expansion as likely to cause us troubles down the road.
*  We ignored those warnings.
*  And I think that we're kind of in a chickens coming home to roost situation right here.
*  I am not a Putin apologist, and he's the principal cause of this catastrophe that we're experiencing.
*  But Putin had been quite candid in warning that the eastward movement of NATO, and in
*  particular, the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, constituted from his perspective a threat
*  to vital Russian security interests.
*  We ignored that.
*  And I think to some degree, this terrible, unnecessary war is the result of that.
*  Well, you know, you're not the only one who says this.
*  One person who warned years ago about NATO expansion in Eastern Europe is William Burns,
*  the current director of the CIA.
*  He served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008.
*  And in his memoir, The Back Channel, Burns wrote, quote,
*  "...sitting at the embassy in Moscow in the mid-'90s, it seemed to me that NATO expansion
*  was premature at best and needlessly provocative at worst."
*  And then in 1995, Burns wrote a memo saying, quote,
*  "...hostility to early NATO expansion is almost universally felt across the domestic
*  political spectrum here."
*  He's talking about Russia.
*  In another memo, Burns wrote, "...Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest
*  of all red lines for the Russian elite, not just Putin.
*  In more than two-and-a-half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers
*  and the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin's sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find
*  anyone who views Ukraine and NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests."
*  Again, those are the words of the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
*  William Burns.
*  Andrew Bacevich?
*  Well, so, one would say that given that kind of warning from a very senior official, highly
*  respected senior official, why did we go ahead and do it anyway?
*  And I think there are two answers to that question.
*  One is because Europeans so desperately wanted to join NATO and to join the EU,
*  seizing their chance to have democracy, to have liberalism, to have the possibility of
*  prosperity.
*  My paternal grandparents came from Lithuania.
*  Lithuania was in the vanguard of countries that wanted to join the EU and NATO.
*  I don't blame the Lithuanian people for that aspiration.
*  And in many respects, joining NATO and the EU has paid dividends for Lithuania.
*  That said, it was done in the face of objections by the Russians, and now we're paying the
*  consequences of those objections.
*  And I think the other reason we did it, of course, apart from what I think is really kind of a
*  deep-seated Russophobia that pervades many members of the American elite, was the belief at that
*  time, that is to say back in the 1990s, the belief that Russia couldn't do anything about it.
*  Russia was weak, Russia was disorganized, and therefore it seemed to be a low-risk proposition
*  to exploit Russian weakness, to advance our objectives, and also to advance the objectives
*  of other European countries, most of which had either been part of the Soviet Union or had been
*  Soviet satellites and saw the end of the Cold War as their chance to achieve freedom and prosperity.
*  I don't blame the Lithuanians.
*  I don't blame the Poles.
*  But I do think that American decision-makers acted impetuously and indeed recklessly, and now
*  we're facing the consequences.
*  Let's talk about this brutal invasion by Putin of Ukraine and also what Putin is demanding.
*  It hasn't gotten as much attention in the United States as in other places, but the demands and
*  written in documents submitted to the U.S. Ukraine ceased military action.
*  Ukraine changed its constitution to enshrine neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian
*  territory, acknowledge Crimea.
*  If you can talk about these demands and also the brutality of what Putin is doing right now.
*  Let's start with the brutality.
*  I must admit that to me the most striking thing about the war as it has evolved
*  has been the crudeness of the Russian war machine.
*  They had portrayed themselves as a modern army.
*  Modern armies know how to use force, to use violence in a controlled and purposeful way.
*  Yeah, people get killed.
*  Buildings get destroyed.
*  But it's not random violence.
*  That, I think, summarizes the conception of modern war.
*  And we believed, and I think the Russians themselves believed,
*  that they had embraced the methods of modern war.
*  It turns out that they did not.
*  And so everything that has happened thus far over the first couple of weeks
*  has demonstrated that they are incapable of using violence in a controlled and politically
*  purposeful way.
*  Which brings us to the present moment where it appears that what we are moving into is some form
*  of siege warfare where violence is used in a random way to punish, to terrorize, I guess,
*  among the Russian commanders with some vague hope that violence used in this way is going to
*  lead to the Ukrainians giving up, collapsing.
*  It remains to be seen if that's going to happen.
*  But that seems to be the current conception among the Russians of how they think
*  they're going to achieve their goals.
*  Whether or not they succeed, what we see, I think, is levels of violence far greater than
*  anybody expected, the probability of civilian deaths and destruction on an enormous scale,
*  and not insignificantly, at least from a Russian point of view, very high Russian casualties.
*  The press reports that say that the Russians have already lost
*  somewhere in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers killed in action is actually, in my view,
*  astonishing and is a powerful statement of how the Russians misread their own military capabilities
*  and therefore plunged into this morass where I don't think anybody on the Russian side,
*  whether Putin or his generals, has a clear picture of how they're going to get out of the mess that
*  they created.
*  AMY GOODMAN So they're calling for Ukraine, talk about what it means to remain neutral,
*  also recognition of Crimea and the independent states, the Donbas region.
*  But I also wanted to quote Zelensky here for a minute.
*  If we can see any movement in both of these parties when it will come to a ceasefire.
*  He made this very important statement on ABC.
*  He said,
*  "'Regarding NATO, I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago, after we understood
*  that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine.'"
*  Talk about what this means.
*  JOHN BARROWS Well, it's too bad people couldn't say that out loud before the war started.
*  I mean, I think—
*  AMY GOODMAN That was Zelensky—
*  JOHN BARROWS —based on what I hear—
*  AMY GOODMAN Pardon me?
*  AMY GOODMAN That was even—that was Zelensky himself, the president of Ukraine.
*  JOHN BARROWS Yeah.
*  I mean, but had Zelensky said, had the Americans said, had NATO said out loud prior to the beginning
*  of the war that we all collectively recognize that Ukraine is not going to be joining NATO
*  anytime soon, if we're willing to put that in writing, then I would argue that it would be
*  at least have been possible, not certain, it might have been possible to dissuade
*  Putin from taking the course that he chose.
*  Again, he chose the course.
*  He's the perpetrator.
*  He's the criminal.
*  But nonetheless, I think a wiser handling of the NATO issue might have given Putin a way to avoid
*  taking the terrible steps that he ended up taking.
*  AMY GOODMAN Zelensky also said—I'm talking about security guarantees, he said.
*  He went on to say,
*  I think that items regarding temporary occupied territories and unrecognized
*  republics that have not been recognized by anyone but Russia, these pseudo-republics,
*  but we can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on.
*  And this was followed by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Kuleba saying,
*  if we could reach an agreement where a similar system of guarantees, as envisaged by the North
*  Atlantic Charter, could be granted to Ukraine by the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
*  including Russia, as well as by Ukraine's neighbors, this is something we're ready to
*  discuss.
*  I mean, we're seeing the broad outline of a possible agreement or ceasefire here.
*  Well, I mean, it seems to me that what you just quoted is courageous, enlightened,
*  especially given the fact that Ukraine has been the victim of this entire thing.
*  And I guess the question is, on the Russian side, are there any signs of that willingness
*  to compromise?
*  And that's where, not that I know anything about discussions going on behind the scenes,
*  but it appears that Russia is not willing to seek a compromise.
*  Quite frankly, if Putin listens to any advisors whatsoever, those advisors should be urging him
*  to find a way to cut a deal, because the longer this war goes, the greater harm
*  this war will inflict on Russia and the Russian people.
*  Again, it's not my job to worry about Russia, but it seems to me if Putin cares at all about
*  the well-being of his nation, then he needs to be working real hard to find a way to back away from
*  the cliff that he's wandered onto.
*  AMY GOODMAN Finally, Andrew Bacevich, if you can explain
*  the argument you make in your piece, headline, The Ukraine Invasion is Nothing Compared to Iraq.
*  I mean, you're a retired colonel, you're a Vietnam War veteran, you lost your son in Iraq.
*  Explain your argument.
*  ANDREW BACEVICH Well, I mean, I don't—not for an instant
*  would I want to minimize the horrors that are unfolding in Ukraine today
*  and the deaths and the injuries inflicted on noncombatants.
*  But let's face it, the numbers are minuscule compared to the number of people that died,
*  were displaced, were injured as a consequence of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  The total number is—according to the Brown University Costs of War Project,
*  the total number is somewhere in the vicinity of 900,000 deaths resulted from
*  our invasion of Afghanistan and our invasion of Iraq.
*  Now, I understand that Americans don't want to talk about that, don't want to remember that.
*  The political establishment wants to move on from that.
*  But there is, I think, a moral dimension to the present war, to the Ukraine war,
*  that should cause us to be a little bit humble,
*  reticent about pointing our fingers at other people.
*  AMY GOODMAN Finally, we only have 30 seconds, but the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
*  been staggering. I mean, you've got not only the government response—of course,
*  Putin has strengthened NATO beyond any NATO activist's wildest imaginings—the corporate
*  response, all of these companies pulling out, the effect of all of this.
*  VINCENT COLLINS Well, I mean, it remains to be seen,
*  but I think your point is basically correct. The negative response that Putin has elicited
*  across—around the world, not everywhere, but most places around the world,
*  has been astonishing and heartening. But let's see. I think it remains to be seen
*  what the policy effects are going to be.
*  AMY GOODMAN We thank you so much for being with us, Andrew Bacevich, a retired colonel,
*  Vietnam War veteran, president and co-founder of the antiwar think tank,
*  Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. His latest book is After the Apocalypse.
