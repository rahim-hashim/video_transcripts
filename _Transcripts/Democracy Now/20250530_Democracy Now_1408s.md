We speak with esteemed historian scholar Ellen Schrecker about the Trump administration's assault on universities and the crackdown on dissent, a climate of fear and censorship she describes as "worse than McCarthyism." 
"During the McCarthy period, it was attacking only individual professors and only about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left. … Today, the repression that's coming out of Washington, D.C., it attacks everything that happens on American campuses," says Schrecker. "The damage that the Trump administration is doing is absolutely beyond the pale and has never, never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education." 
Schrecker is the author of many books about the McCarthy era, Cold War politics and right-wing attacks on academic freedom. Her recent piece for The Nation is headlined "Worse Than McCarthyism: Universities in the Age of Trump."

# “Worse Than McCarthyism”: Historian Ellen Schrecker on Trump’s War Against Universities & Students
**Democracy Now:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU)
*  Democracy depends on a free press. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=0.0s)]
*  Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=2.44s)]
*  President Trump's crackdown on academic institutions in the United States was the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=6.38s)]
*  focus of protests and commencement speeches this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=11.68s)]
*  As universities like Harvard held commencement ceremonies, the Trump administration has now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=15.38s)]
*  directed federal agencies to review all contracts with Harvard, after it already canceled nearly [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=19.56s)]
*  $3 billion in federal research grants for the university and moved last week to revoke [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=26.34s)]
*  its ability to enroll international students. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=31.18s)]
*  Harvard has two separate suits pending against Trump, arguing the moves violate due process [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=35.74s)]
*  as well as free speech protections under the First Amendment because they target the university's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=39.94s)]
*  staff, curriculum and enrollment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  In his address at Harvard's commencement ceremony Thursday, Stanford University professor, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=46.84s)]
*  Dr. and novelist Abraham Verghese praised the school's defiance of Trump and spoke [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=53.34s)]
*  to students facing threats of deportation or having their visas revoked. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=59.18000000000001s)]
*  When legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country, including so many of your [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  international students, worry about being wrongly detained and even deported, perhaps [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=71.14s)]
*  you hear from an immigrant like me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps it's fitting that you hear from someone who was born in Ethiopia when it was ruled [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  by an emperor, someone who then lived under the harsh military leader who overthrew the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=93.62s)]
*  emperor, someone who had at least one of his medical school classmates tortured and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=101.62s)]
*  disappeared. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  More than a quarter of the physicians in this country are foreign medical graduates. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=112.34s)]
*  So a part of what makes America great, if I may use that phrase, is that it allows an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=121.98s)]
*  immigrant like me to blossom here, just as generations of other immigrants and their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=129.98s)]
*  children have flourished and contributed in every walk of life, working to keep America [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=137.78s)]
*  great. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=144.78s)]
*  That's the novelist and medical doctor, Ethiopian-Indian-American Dr. Abraham Verghese, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=146.26s)]
*  addressing Harvard's commencement ceremony on Thursday, his latest book, The Covenant [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=153.26s)]
*  of Water. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=161.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, down the road in Cambridge, the Indian-American class president at MIT, the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=162.66s)]
*  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke about how MIT's undergraduate body and graduate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=170.94s)]
*  student union had voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with Israel. Megha Vemuri wore a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=178.22s)]
*  red and white kaffir and said MIT students would never support a genocide and praised [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=185.46s)]
*  them for continuing to protest despite, quote, threats, intimidation and suppression coming [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=191.12s)]
*  from all directions, especially, she said, your own university officials. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=196.5s)]
*  Last spring, MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union voted overwhelmingly [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=203.5s)]
*  to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military. You called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=208.46s)]
*  and you stood in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian activists on campus. You faced threats, intimidation, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=215.86s)]
*  and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=221.9s)]
*  But you prevailed because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=226.82s)]
*  Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=231.82s)]
*  universities left in Gaza. We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=241.18s)]
*  of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it. The Israeli occupation forces [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=245.9s)]
*  are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with. This means that Israel's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=251.12s)]
*  assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=256.41999999999996s)]
*  school. As scientists, engineers, academics and leaders, we have a commitment to support [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  life, support aid efforts, and call for an arms embargo, and keep demanding now as alumni [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=267.61999999999995s)]
*  that MIT cuts the ties. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  That was MIT class president, Megha Vemuri, now Indian American graduate of MIT. This [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  comes as Jelani Cobb, the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=284.36s)]
*  another school facing attacks by the Trump administration, writes for The New Yorker [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=292.36s)]
*  magazine this week about how, quote, academic freedom in the United States has found itself [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=296.86s)]
*  periodically under siege. In his piece headlined, A Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=303.36s)]
*  to a Close, he describes how he consulted with Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=309.18s)]
*  author of No Ivory Tower, McCarthyism and the Universities, along with other deans at [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=315.38s)]
*  Columbia. They spoke about government repression on college campuses in the 1950s through to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=320.98s)]
*  the present. Schrecker told him, quote, I've studied McCarthyism's impact on higher education [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  for 50 years. What's happening now is worse, he quoted her saying. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=333.76s)]
*  Well we begin today with Ellen Schrecker in person joining us in our New York studio. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=340.08s)]
*  She's the author of Many Are the Crimes, McCarthyism in America, No Ivory Tower, McCarthyism, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  and the Universities. Schrecker's also the author of The Right to Learn, Resisting the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=354.12s)]
*  Right-Wing Attack on Academic Freedom. And she just wrote a piece for The Nation headlined [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=360.04s)]
*  Worse Than McCarthyism, Universities in the Age of Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=365.68s)]
*  Schrecker has been active in the American Association of University Professors, AAUP, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  since the 1990s. I should note she has three degrees from Radcliffe, Harvard, and formerly [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  taught there. She's a graduate of Radcliffe, 1960. Ellen Schrecker, welcome to Democracy [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=382.38000000000005s)]
*  Now! It's great to have you with us. As we look at these universities under attack, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=389.38s)]
*  you've studied higher education for over half a century. Let's talk about what was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=395.5s)]
*  happening then and what's happening today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=400.42s)]
*  Okay. The main thing that happened then to universities was that about 100 faculty members, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=403.42s)]
*  most of them with tenure, were fired and blacklisted. That happened in every major institution [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=411.12s)]
*  of civil society within the United States. And although the universities pride themselves [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=420.18s)]
*  on academic freedom, whatever that means, they collaborated with the forces of repression [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  that were actively imposing a climate of fear and self-censorship throughout American [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=434.34s)]
*  society. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=448.38s)]
*  Today what's happening is worse, so much worse that we have to really find a new phrase [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  for it. I don't know what it'll be. But during the McCarthy period, it was a very [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=456.29999999999995s)]
*  aggressive, very aggressive movement. It was attacking only individual professors and only [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=465.02s)]
*  about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left in the past and in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=474.06s)]
*  the present, then present. Today, the repression that's coming out of Washington, D.C., it [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=481.58s)]
*  is your own repression. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=489.12s)]
*  I want you to start off, we have a very young audience. We also have their parents and their [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=493.0s)]
*  grandparents around the world. And I'd like you to start off by talking about who McCarthy [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=499.02s)]
*  is. What do we mean by the McCarthyism of, for example, the 1950s? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. That's a very good way to start. Because McCarthyism, unfortunately, is misnamed. It [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  It is not just the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who came on to the stage of history [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=516.16s)]
*  in 1950, after the ism that he gave his name to had been really dominating American domestic [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  politics since the late 1940s. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=534.48s)]
*  is when the Truman administration imposed a loyalty test, an anti-communist loyalty test, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=537.88s)]
*  on its employees. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=547.24s)]
*  So if we wanted to name this phenomenon of political repression, anti-communist political [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=549.24s)]
*  repression, and I want to specify that it didn't attack randomly people on the left, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=556.6s)]
*  but very specifically people who had some kind of connection, usually in the past, with [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=564.28s)]
*  the communist movement that during the 1930s and 40s was the most dynamic force on the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=571.36s)]
*  left, even though it was a very flawed, very flawed political group. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=580.48s)]
*  It was nonetheless very influential on the left. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=589.16s)]
*  And if we wanted to give that political repression of the 1940s and 50s a name, it should have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=595.2s)]
*  been Hooverism after the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=603.48s)]
*  You know, the movie Good Night and Good Luck, they showed real black and white footage of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=610.36s)]
*  McCarthy, and test audiences thought he was too harsh, unrealistic, not realizing it was [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=618.2800000000001s)]
*  actual footage. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  And now you have Good Night and Good Luck on Broadway, George Clooney starring in it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=627.32s)]
*  And it is the financially most successful Broadway show we've seen, is going to be [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=633.1600000000001s)]
*  now for free on CNN in a few days. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=637.6800000000001s)]
*  But the significance of that, that what people feel today was a cartoon character, was in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=640.6400000000001s)]
*  fact much harsher and sharper than people ever dreamed. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=647.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=653.36s)]
*  He was beyond the pale, because like the current president, he had no guardrails, as it were. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=655.08s)]
*  Not to mention Roy Cohen, his sidekick in the hearings, who would later go on to mentor [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump until at the very end of his life, Donald Trump rejected him when he was [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=670.28s)]
*  dying of AIDS. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=675.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  So, there are lots of similarities with the fact that there's this very aberrant character [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  at the heart or at the sort of public heart of this repressive movement. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=686.56s)]
*  But what we should have known in the 40s and 50s and should know now is it's not just [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=695.8s)]
*  a one-man show. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=703.04s)]
*  It has been this moment of trying to crack down on dissent, constitutional dissent, free [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=705.48s)]
*  speech, the ability to say what Israel is doing in Gaza is a terrible thing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=714.08s)]
*  That is something that has been building up for decades. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=725.08s)]
*  That was the same thing during McCarthyism. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=733.48s)]
*  There was a kind of network of right-wing activists, similar to groups today like the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=736.0s)]
*  Heritage Society that brought us the 2025 Project Blueprint for Trump's attack on the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=743.6s)]
*  civil liberties and civil society that has come to fruition since he entered the White [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=756.12s)]
*  House. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=768.28s)]
*  So, I mean, you speak as a Jewish author, active member of the American Association [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=769.28s)]
*  of University Professors. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=774.64s)]
*  Would you say that the McCarthyism of yesteryear is the charges that President Trump, with [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=775.96s)]
*  his sidekick Elon Musk giving the Howe-Hitler salute, charging anti-Semitism for what he's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=782.44s)]
*  doing? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=788.44s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is a pretext. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=789.44s)]
*  We know that Trump has been all his life a racist, clearly befriending these fascist [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=791.7600000000001s)]
*  individuals and groups for years. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=800.84s)]
*  And what we're seeing is a kind of melding of Trump's own right-wing proclivities, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  reactionary proclivities, pro-fascist proclivities, with a long-term attempt within some pro-Zionist [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=817.76s)]
*  organizations to eliminate all support for Palestinian freedom and Palestinian liberation [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=826.72s)]
*  from American universities, in particular, but from within American society. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  You have earlier this month a federal judge, Jeffrey Crawford, ordering the release of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=847.1600000000001s)]
*  Columbia University graduate Palestinian activist Mohsen Madhawi from prison in Vermont. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=854.12s)]
*  He was picked up by masked, hooded ICE agents at his naturalization interview in Vermont. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=860.64s)]
*  He was beyond holding a green card. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=868.16s)]
*  The judge writing in his ruling quote, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=871.16s)]
*  I wanted to take it beyond that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=885.12s)]
*  You note that, you know, that we're not just talking about individual professors anymore. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=888.2s)]
*  We're talking about current attacks being much broader. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=892.48s)]
*  And you write that this interesting paradox, quote, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=896.52s)]
*  Despite higher education's much larger footprint within American society, today the Academy [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=901.56s)]
*  is in a much weaker position to resist political intervention. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=907.1999999999999s)]
*  Why is it weaker? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=913.12s)]
*  It's weaker for two reasons. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=914.12s)]
*  One, because the state is stronger. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=916.88s)]
*  The state does much more with regard to higher education than it did in the 1950s. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=921.0s)]
*  It supports most important basic scientific research. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=929.12s)]
*  It regulates things on campus with regard to, shall we say, diversity, equity and inclusion, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=935.76s)]
*  with trying to ensure that all Americans have a good shot at higher education. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=945.16s)]
*  That was a push by the federal government. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=954.4s)]
*  So you can see that the government is much more involved. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=957.96s)]
*  It funds student loans. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  Most smaller universities without huge endowments rely on students who have to get federal loans [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=969.1600000000001s)]
*  in order to pay tuitions. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=978.0s)]
*  So what he's doing by withdrawing federal money from higher education is essentially [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=980.24s)]
*  threatening to destroy American higher education today. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=988.6400000000001s)]
*  I wanted to turn to the clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking in March following [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=993.5200000000001s)]
*  the arrest of the Columbia graduate student, now graduated graduate student, albeit he [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=999.32s)]
*  was in jail in Louisiana when he got his diploma at Columbia. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1006.04s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  If you tell us when you apply, hi, I'm trying to get into the United States on a student [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1012.8399999999999s)]
*  visa. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1017.52s)]
*  I am a big supporter of Hamas, a murderous, barbaric group that kidnaps children, that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1018.52s)]
*  rapes teenage girls, that takes hostages, that allows them to die in captivity, that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1023.52s)]
*  returns more bodies than live hostages. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  If you tell us that you are in favor of a group like this, and if you tell us when you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1030.92s)]
*  apply for your visa, and by the way, I intend to come to your country as a student and rile [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1034.3999999999999s)]

*  If you told us all these things when you applied for a visa, we would deny your visa. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1044.8s)]
*  I hope we would. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1047.9199999999998s)]
*  If you actually end up doing that once you're in this country on such a visa, we will revoke [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1054.08s)]
*  And if you end up having a green card, not citizenship, but a green card as a result [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1055.08s)]
*  of that visa while you're here and those activities, we're going to kick you out. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1058.4799999999998s)]
*  Of course, the Trump administration has not proven any of this. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1062.12s)]
*  And a number of students have been released from prison with very angry judges talking [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1067.08s)]
*  about where are the grounds for these people to be imprisoned. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1073.24s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil has been now imprisoned for three months as his little baby was born here [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1076.96s)]
*  in New York. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1084.32s)]
*  If you can talk about what this leads to, these kind of harsh attacks when it comes [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1086.08s)]
*  to speech, and when it comes to universities. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1093.0s)]
*  You were just addressing the deans at Columbia University. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  Some compare Harvard not fighting—Harvard fighting back against the Trump administration [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  and Columbia conceding and the pressure it's put on its students. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1105.8s)]
*  Yeah, this has been a constant in the history of American higher education to collaborate [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1110.76s)]
*  with political repression. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1120.64s)]
*  Universities do not fight back. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1125.04s)]
*  They didn't fight back during the McCarthy period. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1126.16s)]
*  They were not fighting back until this miracle—it really was a miracle, totally unexpected—of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1128.3600000000001s)]
*  the president at Harvard saying, no, I cannot go along with what you were asking. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1138.32s)]
*  And what they were asking— [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1146.72s)]
*  The Jewish president at Harvard, right, Alan Garber, who President Trump has accusing of [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1147.72s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1153.52s)]
*  Well, of course, we're all anti-Semites, as long as we feel that maybe you shouldn't [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1154.52s)]
*  be killing babies in Gaza every day. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1160.12s)]
*  But what we're seeing is the beginning of a pushback against what Trump is doing, what [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1164.12s)]
*  his entire apparatus of hoodlums, I think, is trying to do to the universities. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1174.04s)]
*  And that wonderful quote you had from Secretary of State Rubio when he said, you know, paraphrasing [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1182.6s)]
*  terrorists, that they wanted to shut down the universities. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1191.58s)]
*  He's doing more to shut down the universities than probably anybody else in America at this [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1195.1399999999999s)]
*  moment. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1201.3s)]
*  Threatening to revoke the visas of all international students. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1202.3s)]
*  What about the role of your organization, the AAUP, the American Association of University [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1205.86s)]
*  Professors? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1211.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1212.78s)]
*  We are a group that is over 100 years old. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1213.78s)]
*  And when we were founded, it was a period very much like today, where outsiders, politicians, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1217.34s)]
*  and especially very wealthy businesspeople, boards of trustees, were interfering with [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1224.06s)]
*  what faculty members were saying and doing with regard to—at that point, there was [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1231.74s)]
*  a lot of labor unrest and attempts to create unions. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1238.06s)]
*  And university professors were sort of saying, well, look at the working conditions under [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1243.5s)]
*  which American workers are being oppressed. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1248.66s)]
*  Let's do something about industrial accidents and things like that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1254.3400000000001s)]
*  Today we're seeing that in every way the federal government, state legislators, interfering [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1260.5s)]
*  with the academic work of university professors. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1273.3s)]
*  And that is what my organization is trying to do, is to protect the integrity and the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1280.46s)]
*  educational value of what goes on on American campuses. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1287.94s)]
*  Do you hold out hope in this last minute we have together? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1293.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, because unfortunately we have no model we can follow from McCarthyism, because there [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1296.9s)]
*  was no pushback. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1304.02s)]
*  But today we're seeing people marching to commencement at Harvard, wearing labels saying, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1305.74s)]
*  you know, enough is enough, President Trump. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1313.3400000000001s)]
*  We're seeing a huge crowd showing up to welcome Mosen coming back from Vermont after [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1316.62s)]

*  We're seeing a growing movement within civil society that has to be maintained and has [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1330.6599999999999s)]

*  has never, never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1347.46s)]
*  So we've got to get out there in the trenches and even begin to think some more about, okay, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1353.6200000000001s)]
*  if they're not paying attention to the judges, if the Supreme Court folds, and let us pray [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH4T55nUCU&t=1359.6200000000001s)]
