# Fox News Highlights - April 1st, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU)
*  Now, disillusioned and disconnected. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, someone call Hakeem Jeffries. Alert the squad. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  With all the other news ricocheting around America, somehow this beautiful nugget got lost in the shuffle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=8.64s)]
*  The Democrat Party's approval numbers remain at a low point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=14.96s)]
*  Harvard-Harris has the survey, only 37 percent approved of Democrat performance. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=19.64s)]
*  This is the worst number for Dems since March of 2018. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  So, look, as much as the media loves to dump on Trump, the Republicans, demonize Doge and Musk, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=29.44s)]
*  the truth is it's the Democrat Party that's on a cliff's edge. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=34.52s)]
*  They have the legacy media, though. They have Hollywood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=38.68s)]
*  They have the federal judges. They have most of academia pushing for them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=40.84s)]
*  And they're still only at 37 percent. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, guys, that's Meghan Markle territory. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=47.68s)]
*  So whatever happens in this Wisconsin race, in the Florida race, Democrats just have a policy problem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=50.56s)]
*  Now, look at this map from the American redistricting project showing states that are [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  projected to gain seats, the green, light green, versus those seats in the next census. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  All of them are run by Democrats. The ones in red and pink are going to lose seats. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=66.44s)]
*  So California projected to lose three seats. New York projected to lose two seats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=71.0s)]
*  Illinois losing one. Texas will gain four. Florida projected to gain four. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=76.28s)]
*  These are facts, right, projections, but based on the census. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=82.8s)]
*  So the Democrats have no one to blame but themselves. Why? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=86.6s)]
*  Because they could have turned California, that's supermajority, you know, they run it, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  supermajority in the governor's race, Senate, House. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=95.12s)]
*  They could have turned it into a showplace. But instead, it's a mess. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=98.0s)]
*  With a $46 billion budget deficit, they could have turned Connecticut, my home state, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=102.8s)]
*  into a dreamscape for business. But instead, of course, businesses are fleeing there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Who wants to pay those taxes? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=111.36s)]
*  And if they wanted to show us how they could do urban renewal, I mean, could they have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=113.36s)]
*  fixed Baltimore? Have you been there lately? And I love Baltimore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=117.6s)]
*  If they wanted to showcase their great education, they could have transformed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Chicago public schools. But guess what? They're among the worst performing in America. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=126.36s)]
*  So they did none of the good stuff. Meanwhile, Florida, Iowa, Texas, Tennessee, South [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=131.72s)]
*  Dakota, I could go on and on, are chalking up one success after another. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=138.44s)]
*  Economic booms, educational choice, tough on crime policies, all of this popular among [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=143.16s)]
*  working people. And by the way, all of them are things that Bill Clinton used to support. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=149.64s)]
*  Remember, he worked to balance the budget with Republicans, he was tough on crime, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=154.56s)]
*  cracked down on illegal immigration, and he didn't have an entire cabinet that was filled [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=158.48s)]
*  with people who hated America. Instead of common sense policies that appeal to a broad [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=164.72s)]
*  base of the working people of this country, Democrats spend their time fighting Trump's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=170.44s)]
*  efforts to deport the most dangerous illegals. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=175.04s)]
*  I call on my colleagues right now to demand the return of people unlawfully taken to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  El Salvador on that so-called plane full of gang bangers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, liberals obsess over one Maryland migrant who was shipped to the Supermax prison in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=194.8s)]
*  What they're actually doing is sweeping up people based upon their appearance and not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=196.36s)]
*  even going through the basic identity checks and due process. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=201.96s)]
*  This guy has no reason to be in a jail in El Salvador. He's only there because of Trump's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=206.52s)]
*  policies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=212.32s)]
*  Now, that screams middle America. Now, not good if it was a mistake, but important to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=214.12s)]
*  note, that guy was an MS-13 member, as court documents showed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=218.64s)]
*  So literally, Democrats spent more time talking about that guy than they ever did about Lakin [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=223.32s)]
*  Reilly or Jocelyn Nungeri, both brutally murdered by illegals. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  You want to know why they're at 37 percent? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  So somehow the party of FDR and Bill Clinton has become the party of AOC and Jayapal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=237.2s)]
*  Now, those two exist for protest. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=243.04s)]
*  Because I'm telling you, if astroturf activism was an Olympic sport, they'd both be gold [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=247.0s)]
*  medalists. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=250.68s)]
*  Congresswoman Jayapal is inviting you to her resistance lab. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=251.68s)]
*  We really need to help Americans understand what happens when democracies fall, when dictators [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=256.52s)]
*  take over. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=262.32s)]
*  We've developed a curriculum where we help people understand how do you go after the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=263.32s)]
*  pillars of support? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=269.48s)]
*  How do you shift allies from being sort of passive opponents to being active supporters [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=270.74s)]
*  of taking down a dictatorship? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=277.94s)]
*  A curriculum? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=281.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=282.5s)]
*  She's smart. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=283.5s)]
*  I mean, this is all they know, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=284.5s)]
*  They emote, they feel, they're outraged. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=286.14s)]
*  And when they lose, democracy becomes a dictatorship. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=289.3s)]
*  That's all you need to know. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=291.98s)]
*  So they prattle on about environmental justice, the patriarchy and reparations, discredited [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=293.3s)]
*  theories and warmed over socialism. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=298.86s)]
*  Nothing to improve the lives of everyday Americans. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=301.86s)]
*  And again, nothing screams middle America like championing the cause of men who claim [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=304.38s)]
*  to be women and vice versa. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=308.58s)]
*  Part of the reason we're in the situation we're in in the first place is because we [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=310.98s)]
*  weren't loud enough to fight for the trans community. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=314.92s)]
*  Trans liberation was never going to be won by capitalistic companies changing their logos [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=319.18s)]
*  to rainbow colors for the month of June. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=325.26s)]
*  It is going to be won how it always has been won by trans people and drag queens throwing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=329.5s)]
*  bricks in the street. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  It's shocking that they lost the mail vote by how much they did. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=337.66s)]
*  But look, this is all a joke to JB. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=341.82000000000005s)]
*  I have to laugh when I hear the right wing carry on about the dangers of exposing kids [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  to trans people or same sex couples. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  And right now it's drag queens reading books and transgender people serving in the military. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=352.82s)]
*  Tomorrow it's your marriage license and your job they want to take. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=359.42s)]
*  And the best example of how tone deaf Democrats are, their opposition to voter ID, which by [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=365.62s)]
*  the way is on the Wisconsin ballot tonight, as we just heard from Mike Tobin. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=370.36s)]
*  While a staggering 84% of Americans support voter ID requirements, Democrats fight it [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=375.18s)]
*  tooth and nail. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=379.94s)]
*  Everywhere it pops up, rallying to help defeat, at least temporarily, a Republican measure [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=381.5s)]
*  called the SAVE Act, which will require it nationwide. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=385.46s)]
*  More on that later. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=388.5s)]
*  New York AG Letitia James, oh she's a fair one, says the SAVE Act will threaten voting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=389.5s)]
*  rights for communities of color and women. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=395.26s)]
*  Why oppose such a common sense measure though? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=399.58s)]
*  Because they want illegals to vote, that's why. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=402.02s)]
*  There's no other logical reason. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=404.66s)]
*  Elon Musk has said that, of course, we've known that for many years. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=405.86s)]
*  We could go on and on. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=409.06s)]
*  Democrats defending Hamas, Democrats terrorizing Tesla owners, Democrats against parental rights. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=411.82s)]
*  Robbie, don't worry, we won't tell your mommy that you're now Rebecca. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=417.46s)]
*  None of this is popular. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  No wonder the elected Democrats are running to the courts and George Soros to save them, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  because they're on the wrong side of most issues that matter the most to Americans, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=429.06s)]
*  yet they're laser focused on defending deviants, derelicts, deadbeats, and drug dealers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=432.74s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=437.96s)]
*  Fox News alert. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=439.06s)]
*  The polls are officially closed in Florida's first district where we're watching the race [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=442.26s)]
*  to replace former Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=447.1s)]
*  A few minutes ago, the AP called the race for Florida's sixth district, Mike Waltz's [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=449.9s)]
*  seat, which the Republican candidate Randy Fine won easily. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=454.54s)]
*  So if the Republican running for Gaetz's seat, Jimmy Petronis, wins his race as well, that's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=459.5s)]
*  good news for the Trump agenda. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=464.46s)]
*  And Republicans will keep their margin in the House and we'll keep you posted. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=466.34s)]
*  Well Spartacus is back and he shattered the filibuster record. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=472.29999999999995s)]
*  The Senator, my Senator actually, hey Corey, has been speaking for over 25 straight hours [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=476.06s)]
*  and no one can figure out what he wants. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=482.29999999999995s)]
*  Lift every voice and sing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=485.78s)]
*  Lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  You think we got civil rights because one day Strom Thurmond, after filibustering for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=493.78s)]
*  24 hours, you think we got civil rights because he came to the floor one day and said, I've [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=499.09999999999997s)]
*  seen the light. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=507.5s)]

*  And I'm glad you brought up this point again, because I would like to point out that if you just saw the headline from the insane failing Atlantic magazine this morning, you would think this individual was father of the year, living in Maryland, living a peaceful life when that couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=701.98s)]
*  Did the Democrats call an MS-13 ringleader a Maryland dad? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=719.02s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=723.3399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Kilmore Garcia snuck into this country under Barack Obama and was arrested in 2019 in a sweep of high ranking members of MS-13. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=724.9s)]
*  What was a Maryland dad doing hanging out with MS-13? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=735.66s)]
*  Oh, I know, because he's a verified member of MS-13. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=740.3s)]
*  That's what the Department of Homeland Security designated him as. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=744.66s)]
*  The judge thought Garcia was so dangerous, he denied him bond because he was a flight risk. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=748.78s)]
*  Prime Time reached out to Homeland Security and they said this. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=755.02s)]
*  The individual in question is a member of the brutal MS-13 gang. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=758.54s)]
*  We have intelligence reports that he is involved in human trafficking. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=762.8199999999999s)]
*  Whether he is in El Salvador or a detention facility in the United States, he should be locked up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=766.4599999999999s)]
*  So the guy Democrats refer to as an innocent Maryland dad is actually a certified MS-13 gang member. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=772.98s)]
*  Illegal alien and human trafficker. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=778.78s)]
*  And he's not from Maryland. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=781.66s)]
*  He's from El Salvador. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=783.5s)]
*  It's like if I snuck south of the border and got arrested in Mexico City on gang charges, would Democrats call me a Mexico City dad? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=785.86s)]
*  And just because you have a kid doesn't make you innocent. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=794.38s)]
*  OJ had kids. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=797.14s)]
*  Did Democrats call him a California dad? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=798.42s)]
*  Actually, OJ was innocent. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  So maybe they did. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=803.4599999999999s)]
*  You have foreign terrorists telling judges, my life's in danger if you deport me. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=805.22s)]
*  Well, our lives are in danger if we don't deport you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=809.86s)]
*  And if you're a terrorist, life's dangerous wherever you are. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=813.62s)]
*  You chose that life and you have to live with it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=817.34s)]
*  And the administration's designated MS-13 as terrorists so they don't get the kind of due process Democrats think they do. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=820.62s)]
*  But lawyers are going to lawyer and rack up fees. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=828.46s)]
*  I wonder if cartels have American lawyers on retainer to keep gang members from getting deported, because that's what it seems like. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=831.98s)]
*  These lawyers keep leaking to the media that their clients are innocent and the media just laps it up and prints it as fact. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=839.02s)]
*  I've heard more about terrorists being denied due process than I ever heard about Lake and Riley. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=845.74s)]
*  On the five, Jessica has been telling me for weeks about a gay barber. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=851.02s)]
*  Time magazine was there when the gay barber from Venezuela who had a crown tattoo that said mom was being processed. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=856.74s)]
*  We talked earlier in the week about the Venezuelan gay barber who is not in Trender Aragua who's in there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=865.34s)]
*  Mr. Jose Romero was actually more of a makeup artist than a barber. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=872.66s)]
*  As usual, Jessica was a little off. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=877.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's Jose posing with makeup brushes. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=880.34s)]
*  Would I let this guy do my makeup? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=883.58s)]
*  No, because here's this guy when he was arrested. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=885.98s)]
*  He's Trender Aragua, again, a Latin gang that Trump designated as a terrorist organization. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=889.9s)]
*  When Jose rolls up his sleeves, he's got double crown tattoos on his wrists, a key indicator of gang membership. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=896.0600000000001s)]
*  Homeland Security told Primetime, quote, DHS intelligence assessments determined he is a member of the vicious gang Trender Aragua. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=903.26s)]
*  DHS intelligence goes beyond a single tattoo. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=911.66s)]
*  We're confident in our findings. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=914.78s)]
*  Do you trust Homeland Security intelligence agents who do this for a living or Jessica Tarloff, who I love, but probably just read about this guy Jose in Time magazine? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=917.46s)]
*  Primetime doesn't want to put innocent people in mega prisons. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=927.54s)]
*  If there's a mistake, there's a mistake and we'll straighten it out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=930.06s)]
*  But the people who let 10 million migrants into this country and made 10 million mistakes, they've lost their right to chirp. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=933.86s)]
*  Because their mistakes are deadly. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=941.3s)]
*  And an illegal alien who was released by the Biden administration into our country was just arrested in Georgia and charged with the horrific killing of Camellia Williams, a mother of five and grandmother. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=944.1s)]
*  The suspect has now been indicted on charges of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, rape, aggravated sexual battery and necrophilia. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=957.02s)]
*  Which, for those who don't know, necrophilia is a sexual obsession with a corpse. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=967.3399999999999s)]
*  This sub suspect was ordered to be removed in July 2023, but the Biden administration allowed him to stay. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=973.18s)]
*  Necrophilia. Democrats are going to go to bat for savages like that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=981.06s)]
*  Sick. Biden caught and released these freaks, let them prey on us in sanctuary cities, gave them all lawyers in hotel rooms and then lied about it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=986.02s)]
*  Here's what a border chief said just a few months back. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=995.14s)]
*  I had to release illegal aliens by the hundreds each day into communities who could not support them to quiet the problem. Two flights a week were provided from San Diego to Texas. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=998.62s)]
*  These flights simply brought aliens that would have been released in San Diego over to Texas. Each flight cost approximately $150,000. This was the administration's way to try and quiet the border wide crisis. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1008.06s)]
*  Through pressure from the administration, my headquarters became more interested in the fiction that being portrayed in the media and not at all concerned with reality. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1020.86s)]
*  Each time we asked for help in dealing with a new issue, it fell on deaf ears. At times in San Diego, we had 2000 or more aliens sitting in between the fences asking to turn themselves in. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1028.58s)]
*  I was told to move them out of sight of the media. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1039.58s)]
*  We spent four years sweeping this invasion under the rug and now Democrats and activist judges are trying to stop us from sweeping them out of the country. These politicians pretend to have empathy, but what about empathy for us? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1042.58s)]
*  I'm one of the many victims across the nation of the violent transnational gang, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1054.9799999999998s)]
*  Trenderagua and a former lifelong Democrat. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1059.5s)]
*  We watched in horror as a few apartments full of migrant families quickly evolved into large groups of gun toting, military-aged males, open-air drug use, drug dealers, and seemingly underage prostitutes filled the common areas of the buildings. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1065.14s)]
*  A young man, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1082.46s)]
*  who I called my friend, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1084.98s)]
*  was mortally wounded outside my apartment during a firestorm of bullets causing thousands of dollars in damages to cars and surrounding properties by six gunmen later identified as Trenderagua. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1086.38s)]
*  If someone allows wolves into our chicken coop and there's a bloodbath, they don't get to grumble about how I get rid of the wolves. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1102.5s)]
*  Oh, that wolf you rounded up. Maybe it's not a wolf. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1109.7s)]
*  Well, it's got my chicken in between its teeth. It's a wolf and we're getting it out of here. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1113.5s)]
*  Now they're saying, of course, it's racist to deport terrorists. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1118.6599999999999s)]
*  One of my premises for the book is that every law passed before the 1965 Voting Rights Act should be presumptively unconstitutional, right? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1123.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. Because before the 1965 Voting Rights Act, we were functionally an apartheid country. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1132.46s)]
*  Not everybody who lived here could vote here. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1137.46s)]
*  So why should I give about some law that some old white man passed in the 1920s? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1139.42s)]
*  Old white men passed the 22nd Amendment. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1145.3s)]
*  So if we get rid of that, Trump can run again. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1147.26s)]
*  A majority of the country backs mass deportations. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1150.54s)]
*  During the Iranian hostage crisis, Jimmy Carter deported thousands of Iranians. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1153.82s)]
*  This was done on the basis of national security. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1157.86s)]
*  What Democrats today are saying makes Jimmy Carter a racist dictator. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1160.8200000000002s)]

*  Oh, and let's check in on Booker one last time. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1171.66s)]
*  He's done. He ended at 8.05. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1175.5s)]
*  That's the record. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1179.7800000000002s)]
*  But in honor of April Fool's Day, we begin tonight with more insanity. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1181.3000000000002s)]
*  It never ends from the Democratic Party. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1185.74s)]
*  For some reason, Cory Booker decided to speak nonstop on the Senate floor for 24 hours. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1187.7s)]
*  No food, no bathroom breaks, no silence. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1193.8200000000002s)]
*  Just Cory Booker's performative art at a podium talking for hours saying nothing worthwhile. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1196.94s)]
*  And of course, it's not a filibuster. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1204.5800000000002s)]
*  He's not officially blocking any bill, but he did go on and on and on all about his hatred. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1206.74s)]
*  Of all things, Donald Trump, what a shock. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1212.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1215.66s)]
*  I confess that I have been imperfect. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1216.9s)]
*  I confess that I've been inadequate to the moment. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1220.18s)]
*  I confess that the Democratic Party has made terrible mistakes. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1223.3s)]
*  That have given lane to this demagogue. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1228.7s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1231.3400000000001s)]
*  We need you now. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1232.8200000000002s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1234.3400000000001s)]

*  I don't want a whitewash history. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1244.94s)]

*  Tell me the wretched truth about America today and to tomorrow. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1247.94s)]
*  I'm going to stand as long as I can, as long as I can. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1252.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to stand and read stories like this because you are seen. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1255.3s)]
*  You are heard. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1258.98s)]
*  When is it going to be enough? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1260.06s)]
*  My voice is inadequate. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1261.7s)]
*  My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they're trying to do. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1263.3400000000001s)]
*  Nobody was watching. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1270.3s)]
*  We haven't seen this much bravery from Cory Booker since he referred to himself as Spartacus. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1271.54s)]
*  That was during the Kavanaugh witch hunt. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1277.4199999999998s)]
*  But when you think the hysteria can't get any worse, well, think again. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1279.58s)]
*  Last night on MSDNC, far left Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal promoted her very own training [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1283.02s)]
*  program to teach the American people how to fight back against looming Trump dictatorship [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1291.58s)]
*  that's about to occur. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1296.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1297.82s)]
*  I mean, what we decided is that we really need to help Americans understand what happens [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1299.38s)]
*  when democracies fall, when dictators take over. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1305.02s)]
*  We've been pretty complacent in America. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1308.14s)]
*  We haven't had to really deal with this in any real way. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1310.5s)]
*  And now I think people need to understand what are the lessons from other countries [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1314.5800000000002s)]
*  and working with experts who have studied democratic backsliding in countries around [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1319.1000000000001s)]
*  the world and the resistance movements that emerge to take on that democratic backsliding. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1323.98s)]
*  We've developed a curriculum where we help people understand how do you go after the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1329.46s)]
*  pillars of support, not necessarily the person at the top, but the pillars of support that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1335.5800000000002s)]
*  allow that person to continue to have power. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1340.6200000000001s)]
*  And how do you shift allies from being sort of passive opponents to being active [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1343.46s)]
*  supporters of taking down a dictatorship? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1349.8200000000002s)]
*  How to be a left-wing squad lunatic and not to be outdone on Capitol Hill. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1354.5800000000002s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin may be my favorite quote of the year. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1359.26s)]
*  As usual, making a complete jackass out of himself and is now demanding that Donald Trump [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1363.14s)]
*  bring back the violent, illegal immigrant, Trende Aragua gang members that President [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1368.5s)]
*  Trump deported to El Salvador. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1374.26s)]
*  Wow. I have a condition. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1376.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1378.3s)]
*  I call on them to demand that the Trump administration comply with all judicial orders [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1379.86s)]
*  while appealing whichever ones they want to appeal and to demand the return of people [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1385.1s)]
*  unlawfully taken to El Salvador on that so-called plane full of gang bangers. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1390.3799999999999s)]
*  I'll cut a deal with Jamie Raskin. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1396.9399999999998s)]
*  I'll be fine with his plan as long as the Trende Aragua gang members live in Jamie [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1398.74s)]
*  Raskin's house with ankle bracelets. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1404.4199999999998s)]
*  We'll have more on these gang members coming up with Senator Ted Cruz tonight. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1406.94s)]
*  But while Raskin is most concerned with the rights of criminal illegal aliens over the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1410.7s)]
*  safety of American citizens, his colleague, well, she's in the news every day. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1415.9s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett is focused on America's far left activist judges now abusing their [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1420.26s)]
*  power in a desperate attempt to thwart Donald Trump's agenda. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1425.94s)]
*  Today, she just couldn't believe that Republicans would dare criticize federal judges, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1429.42s)]
*  that is until Congressman Darrell Issa reminded her about her plan to impeach [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1435.1399999999999s)]
*  justices Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1441.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1444.7s)]
*  The problem that we have right now is that if we continue down this road, then we will [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1446.22s)]
*  not have a rule of law because we have people that are currently serving and they're [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1450.6599999999999s)]
*  saying things like ignore the judge's order. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1454.54s)]
*  What it means to have law and order in this country is that you follow the order and [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1457.82s)]
*  you go through the appeals process even if you dislike what the judge did. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1462.26s)]
*  Thank you. And I yield. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1466.74s)]
*  I'll yield back to you. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1468.22s)]
*  I see you had a question for me, which I'll yield to you now. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1468.9s)]
*  Now that there's no time left. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1472.06s)]
*  Thanks, Eric. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1474.34s)]
*  You're good. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1475.66s)]
*  You're good at that. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  But I'll take my own time. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1477.02s)]
*  I'll recognize myself. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1478.06s)]
*  And I'm going to note that when Miss Ocasio-Cortez, or AOC as we know her, filed [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1479.86s)]
*  articles of impeachment on Justice Thomas and Alito. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1489.66s)]
*  Miss Crockett was one of the co-sponsor, along with Mr. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1494.02s)]
*  Cohen, both members of this committee. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1496.74s)]
*  It does seem interesting that when the shoe is on the other foot, everyone is self-righteous. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1499.86s)]
*  Wow. Pretty, pretty great. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1505.38s)]
*  Minor reminder. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1506.82s)]
*  Oopsie daisy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1507.94s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1508.94s)]
*  Also remember, top Democrats even supported court packing all in an effort to all but [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1510.14s)]
*  eliminate the judicial branch of government. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1515.74s)]
*  But of course, they now love judges who use nationwide injunctions against Donald Trump [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1518.0600000000002s)]
*  with regularity. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1523.42s)]
*  Now think about it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1525.02s)]
*  One far left, unelected judge representing a lower court gets to stop a duly elected [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1525.7800000000002s)]
*  president, in this case, Donald Trump, and a policy nationwide even before that case [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1531.8200000000002s)]
*  is adjudicated. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1537.0600000000002s)]
*  That is a nationwide injunction. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1538.5800000000002s)]
*  It's never now. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1540.74s)]
*  This never once happened before 1963. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1541.74s)]
*  George W. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1544.82s)]
*  Bush faced only six nationwide injunctions in two terms. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1545.66s)]
*  Obama in two terms, he was subject to 12. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1550.18s)]
*  But during Trump's first term, there are a whopping 64 nationwide injunctions, then back [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1554.02s)]
*  down to 14 under Joe Biden. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1560.02s)]
*  So far, in just the first two months of his second term, President Trump has already [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1562.06s)]
*  eclipsed that number with 17 nationwide injunctions. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1567.46s)]
*  This is just more democratic lawfare, more weaponization of our justice system. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1571.26s)]
*  This needs to be cleaned up. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1576.42s)]
*  And while Democrats in Congress, they scream and they yell and they make fools out of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  themselves, this is the real resistance to Trump. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1581.7800000000002s)]
*  They're using unelected judges. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1585.66s)]
*  What they can't win at the ballot box, what they can't get done legislatively, they run [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1587.8600000000001s)]
*  to judicial activist judges acting as kings, even blocking staffing decisions in the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1592.38s)]
*  executive branch of government. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1598.5400000000002s)]
*  At one point, a judge seemingly barred the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, viewing [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1600.34s)]
*  files at his own Department of Treasury. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1605.5s)]
*  And, you know, is this not insane and totally unconstitutional? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1607.82s)]
*  As Senator Grassley pointed out today in The Wall Street Journal, quote, Article three [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1612.2199999999998s)]
*  of our Constitution, task the judicial branch with resolving cases and controversies, not [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1616.6599999999999s)]
*  making policies. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1623.54s)]
*  According to a story in The Wall Street Journal, many of these injunctions also break [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1624.82s)]
*  what's called Rule sixty five C. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1629.54s)]
*  And that states that a party seeking an injunction needs to put up a bond to cover its [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1631.78s)]
*  costs. Well, these bonds are not optional. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1636.94s)]
*  They happen to be mandatory, but were not applied to these nationwide injunctions. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1639.94s)]
*  That invalidates them. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1644.6599999999999s)]
*  Now, Senator Grassley, he is pushing the Judicial Relief Clarification Act in the U.S. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1646.22s)]

*  while enjoying a movie. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1862.3799999999999s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1863.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, these days, theaters are as empty as Kamala's medicine cabinet. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1865.26s)]
*  True, it's never really recovered from covid and the idea of sitting with strangers to watch a movie. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1869.78s)]
*  Well, it seems as foreign as the men I hire to cradle me while I nap. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1875.1399999999999s)]
*  So the theaters are trying to get trying everything to get people back in the seats, including [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1882.4599999999998s)]
*  reclining seats, alcohol service, fine dining, and now pot smoking and texting. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1887.02s)]
*  But it is funny that they think weed and texting will bring you back, since those are two things you can also do at [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1892.6999999999998s)]
*  home. But there's one thing you can't do at home that they overlook. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1898.54s)]
*  Make better movies, which is a lot harder than saying, hey, let's attract more rude, smelly potheads. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1903.34s)]
*  You know, the people a smart industry would try to keep out of their place of business. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1909.7s)]
*  Seriously, welcoming texting potheads in a theater, that's like a restaurant saying, hey, we don't need a new [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1914.18s)]
*  chef. We need more salmonella. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1919.38s)]
*  But such remedies are easier than admitting the truth that the product sucks. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1922.82s)]
*  Disney will lose hundreds of millions on Snow White because they were more concerned with being woke than being [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1927.6200000000001s)]
*  watchable. Plus, it doesn't help that the new Snow White thinks she's Joy Reid with hair. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1932.98s)]
*  And if this is what Disney did to Snow White, can you imagine if they do yet another reboot of Cinderella? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1939.78s)]
*  Ten bucks, it's Prince Charming who puts on the glass slipper because it matches his transparent thong. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1947.14s)]
*  Hollywood thinks we're idiots for wanting exciting movies with relatable heroes. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1955.1000000000001s)]
*  So instead, they gave you a musical celebrating a trans transgender drug dealer. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1959.38s)]
*  Amelia Perez got 13 Oscar nominations and sold about 13 tickets. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1964.22s)]
*  But you got to admit, getting neutered helps you hit the high notes. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1969.5s)]
*  Movie theaters can throw in all the goodies they want, but it won't help if the movies suck harder than the view on [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1974.18s)]
*  a pork flavored lollipop. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1980.42s)]
*  Rather than make movies people want to go see, they offer crap that actually makes the experience worse. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1984.98s)]
*  And you know what that reminds me of? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1990.34s)]
*  You guessed it, the Democrat Party. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1992.06s)]
*  Instead of approving the product, they keep appealing to their worst customers. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1994.6599999999999s)]
*  Even the New York Times admits it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=1999.46s)]
*  The rag put out a scathing rebuke of the party saying they're in denial of their 2024 election loss. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2001.62s)]
*  The Times of all places even said it even says they moved too far to the left. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2007.34s)]
*  Hell, that's like Chris Christie telling you to lay off the donuts. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2013.86s)]
*  But rather than try to correct their dissent into absurdity, they embrace more absurdity. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2017.34s)]
*  Instead of admitting their colossal error, it's just more fabrications. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2021.9399999999998s)]
*  In this case, they decided that Elon is a Nazi. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2025.74s)]
*  OK, but didn't he used to be your hero? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2029.26s)]
*  You know, it says something that the Dems can expect its mob of supporters to turn on a dime, which they do. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2032.6999999999998s)]
*  So how could the party be so confident the mob would go from adoring the king of climate change to wanting to [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2039.54s)]
*  hang in the town square? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2045.86s)]
*  Well, like the film industry, the Democrat Party hold an arrogant disdain for their customers. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2047.86s)]
*  So much so that it can push stupid ideas and assume their customers will just eat it up. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2053.18s)]
*  The Democrat mob are no different than bit actors willing to perform whatever script you give them that day. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2060.2999999999997s)]
*  They get paid for the work and when the clock hits noon, they're gone. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2066.06s)]
*  It could be a protest against cops, fracking, musketeering, and even the police. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2070.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter. Just supply the signs and the paycheck and they'll picket their grandmother for going as Pocahontas for Halloween in 1940. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2075.58s)]
*  It's so like smoking pot or being allowed to text in a theater. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2085.02s)]
*  The Democrats latest moves do nothing to address the unsolvable problem within the party. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2088.14s)]
*  Their movie is one that no one wants a ticket to because in this film called Life, they're the villains and there will be no sequel. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2093.54s)]

*  Why do I do this to you? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2153.9s)]
*  Do you think pot and texting is going to help you get paid for the work? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2154.9s)]
*  Pot and texting is going to help the movie industry? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2158.66s)]
*  I think it's such a horrible idea and I think it is a great analogy. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2162.46s)]
*  That's such a great analogy. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2165.42s)]
*  The Democratic Party at no point, they just make excuses. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2167.1s)]
*  They never take responsibility. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2170.2999999999997s)]
*  That's like the key number one to life in politics is to take responsibility. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2171.42s)]
*  Even with my, you know, my ex-wife situation, there are times I can look at myself and go, what could I have done differently? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2174.74s)]

*  You know what I mean? That's something I could have changed. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2185.98s)]
*  And like the movie theater thing, if you're going to text and smoke weed at the movie, maybe we didn't want to go to a movie tonight. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2187.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2194.1s)]

*  I like distractions. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2202.74s)]

*  Party, kind of similar? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2256.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it is. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2257.7400000000002s)]
*  You look at CNN and NBC, the latest approval rating, the lowest in history for Democrats, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2258.9s)]
*  down around 28 percent right now. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2264.3s)]
*  So maybe they should be smoking, perhaps that might help them. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2266.46s)]
*  And they're blaming inflation, things that they're saying are outside of their control. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2270.58s)]
*  Well, no, it's an open border policy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2276.46s)]
*  It's soft on crime. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2279.14s)]
*  It's transgender athletes. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2280.7799999999997s)]
*  That doesn't resonate with the majority of the American people. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2282.66s)]
*  So you have the new DNC chair, Ken Martin. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2286.14s)]
*  Ken Martin, he's saying, no, our messaging is right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2289.34s)]
*  No, your messaging is wrong. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2293.22s)]
*  It's not about connecting your messaging to the people. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2295.34s)]
*  You have to change your policies. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2297.74s)]
*  So I think they have a big challenge ahead and maybe they should go to the movies with Jamie. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2300.06s)]
*  His message should be, our message is wrong. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2304.58s)]
*  Right, because it didn't work. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2309.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2311.38s)]
*  And then everybody go, yes, we agree with you. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2311.9s)]
*  And then their numbers go up. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2315.18s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2316.5s)]
*  I totally agree with the Democratic message. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2317.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2319.54s)]
*  I am a genius, Kennedy. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2320.02s)]
*  How did I come up with that so quickly? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2321.46s)]
*  I don't know, but we need to tap your brain for ideas like they do those maple syrup trees in Vermont. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2322.86s)]
*  Oh, it gets so sticky all over your hands. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2328.86s)]
*  So gooey. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2331.1800000000003s)]
*  It's called sap, I believe. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2331.82s)]
*  I thought it was just maple syrup. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2334.5s)]
*  No, it's originally a sap. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2335.7400000000002s)]
*  Is it maple sap? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2337.1s)]
*  Look, we are going off topic here. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2338.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, no, that never happens here. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2340.54s)]
*  Do you think this pot smoking and texting is a good idea? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2344.1400000000003s)]
*  No, I'm with you. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2346.9s)]
*  If I was stuck in a movie theater, that's like a nightmare. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2348.34s)]
*  That's like one of those nightmares where, you know, you wake up and you're in college [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2352.94s)]
*  and you're taking a full load of classes and you sweep before finals and you can't drop any of the classes. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2357.18s)]
*  Like being stuck, like I'm all for freedom to put whatever you want in your body, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2362.2999999999997s)]
*  but being stuck in a closed room for two hours with a bunch of inconsiderate stoners, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2367.94s)]
*  that is my worst nightmare. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2373.8199999999997s)]
*  Like I would want to take a handful of pills at that point. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2375.98s)]
*  I thought that until I heard they serve nachos in movie theaters. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2379.18s)]
*  You know what you made me think, Kennedy, which is people shouldn't... [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2383.7s)]
*  Like one of the best arguments about not going to college is if you don't go to college, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2387.8199999999997s)]
*  you don't have the missing college... [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2392.14s)]
*  You don't have the dreams that you have of missing college. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2393.7799999999997s)]
*  If you don't go to college, you will never have those nightmares [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2397.62s)]
*  because you can't dream about something you never had. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2400.62s)]
*  Tyrus. Oh, I have a good question for you, Tyrus. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2405.22s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2407.2599999999998s)]
*  Usually I just like... [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2408.54s)]
*  OK, if you could fix the film industry or the Democrat Party, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2409.74s)]
*  which would you pick and how would you do it? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2414.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, they're one and the same. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2417.02s)]
*  So you could... [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2418.54s)]
*  Trick question. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2419.54s)]
*  Yeah, you could fix them both by them getting the activists out. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2420.4199999999996s)]
*  That's the both problem. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2424.58s)]
*  You have activists in movies and you have activists in the Democratic Party. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2425.54s)]
*  And the thing is, is that they don't have a following. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2429.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2432.3799999999997s)]
*  So that's why they're always 80-20. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2432.7s)]
*  It's always 80% common sense and they're 20% is what they're standing on [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2434.4599999999996s)]
*  because they have individuals who are disturbed. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2438.62s)]
*  And I'm tired of them stealing ideas from other cultures. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2440.66s)]
*  Listen, we've been smoking weed and texting in movies for generations. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2443.94s)]
*  Like this is... [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2447.62s)]
*  This is... [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2448.58s)]
*  Like, you know, you're not going to take... [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2449.58s)]
*  Like, no one will ever complain about... [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2451.06s)]
*  The brothers are in here. How do you know? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2453.8599999999997s)]
*  Weed and texting and yelling at them. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2455.2999999999997s)]
*  Now we can't identify who the problem is anymore. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2457.06s)]
*  And when white people take over something we do, they always go too far. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2459.94s)]
*  That is true. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2462.7799999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like... [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2463.74s)]
*  Another thing is like, so what if somebody wants to break out a pack of Marlbrows [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2464.7799999999997s)]
*  at the movie theater because you're smoking? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2468.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like... [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2470.2599999999998s)]
*  It's a terrible idea. You're so right. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2471.5s)]
*  It used to... I used to love going to the movies. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2473.94s)]
*  I still go with my son because that's kind of our thing, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2475.86s)]
*  but my daughter's like, you know, we don't want to go. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2478.06s)]
*  It used to be you would go to the premiere. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2480.06s)]
*  Like when a Marvel movie is coming out, you would be there Thursday at midnight. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2481.9s)]
*  Christmas was everyone went to the movies because why? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2485.06s)]
*  Because they were awesome movies. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2488.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2489.58s)]
*  And they were good. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2489.94s)]
*  And none of the stars pissed you off on X for six months. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2490.7799999999997s)]
*  You didn't have De Niro running around like an idiot [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2494.58s)]
*  to where any movie he's in now, you don't want to watch. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2496.7s)]
*  They pissed off. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2499.3799999999997s)]
*  See, in their wokeness, they pissed off the group that buy us. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2500.14s)]
*  The woke don't buy anything. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2505.3799999999997s)]
*  No, they're cheap bastards. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2506.7799999999997s)]
*  They don't have jobs. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2507.98s)]
*  And you're like, we don't want you. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2509.22s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2510.58s)]
*  Yeah. God. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2511.7799999999997s)]
*  Not to mention the lines for food is slow enough. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2514.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2518.8599999999997s)]
*  Did you imagine a bunch of high munchies in line? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2519.22s)]
*  Yeah. And the workers are doing the same. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2522.2999999999997s)]
*  Can you? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2524.8199999999997s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2525.86s)]
*  I don't know. What do you want? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2526.7000000000003s)]
*  Everything looks so good. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2527.6600000000003s)]
*  They would just have to dump food from the ceiling, like big buckets of food. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2528.6200000000003s)]
*  And then they're paying for it with quarters and nickels and crunched up dollars. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2532.1800000000003s)]
*  Nobody wants that at the movie theater. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2535.34s)]
*  God, I miss going to movie premieres as a kid. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2537.1400000000003s)]
*  It was a cool thing. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2539.78s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWszgVcMoYU&t=2540.78s)]
