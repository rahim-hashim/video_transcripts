# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 7, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y)
*  If you were forced to switch places with one person, would it be this guy on the table? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Or this guy standing at the doorway of the Department of Education? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=6.5s)]
*  Welcome to the big top. The only thing this circus today was missing were the three rings and a sword-salt swallower. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=19.0s)]
*  Although when her clips finished making the rounds, well, Democrats will wish Mad Maxine would have swallowed her worthless words. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=41.0s)]
*  We're coming in. We're coming in. We're coming in. Don't lock the door. We're coming in. Who are you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=50.0s)]
*  You're not coming in. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=57.0s)]
*  Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=58.0s)]
*  Who are you, sir? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=61.0s)]
*  Do you have business here? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=62.0s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=63.0s)]
*  Get out of the way. We pay you. We pay for your job. We pay you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=64.0s)]
*  We pay you. We pay you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=69.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? You're going to beat us up if we go in? You won't have a job if we don't help you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=71.0s)]
*  This is what it's come to for the Democrats. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=78.0s)]
*  You know, as Trump's team exposes the waste, the fraud, the abuse of these federal agencies, liberals in Congress are relegated to stunt-style politics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=81.0s)]
*  And today, things look borderline insurrection-y at times. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=91.0s)]
*  Anyone must hire you? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=96.0s)]
*  Who do you work for? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=98.0s)]
*  Are you not aware of members of the funders and whatever? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=100.0s)]
*  We're trying to save your job. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=104.0s)]
*  As a former Department of Education employee myself, well, let me tell you one thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=107.0s)]
*  It was a place that was loaded with waste decades ago. I saw it when I was 22 years of age, walking the hallways. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=114.0s)]
*  And now it's only gotten worse because as the bureaucracy blows billions in taxpayer dollars, our kids are only getting dumber. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=122.0s)]
*  But you get the sense that the Democrats like it that way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=131.0s)]
*  When Donald Trump and Elon Musk and House Republicans look at funding for public education, they see dollar signs for their private interest friends. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=135.0s)]
*  Will you stand up to a would-be king who thinks that he can dismantle the Department of Education without congressional concurrence? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=145.0s)]
*  Who's going to inherit this beautiful building that they want to sell all of the government buildings? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=155.0s)]
*  Is this going to become the next Trump hotel? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=163.0s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. Who knows? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=167.0s)]
*  And President Trump spoke out today on our education gap. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=171.0s)]
*  We want great education. I like choice. We all like choice. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=175.0s)]
*  But beyond choice, long beyond choice, I want to see it go back to the states where great states that do so well have no debt. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=179.0s)]
*  They're operated brilliantly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=187.0s)]
*  And most Americans do agree with them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=189.0s)]
*  They support educational choice for parents, 69 percent in a recent poll. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=192.0s)]
*  And of course, a top ally is in is wanting to insulate government run schools from scrutiny. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=198.0s)]
*  They always have. And the same woman who wanted kids locked out of schools and stuck behind screens during covid has been speaking out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=205.0s)]
*  Now, notice that because she can't defend her own union's record, Randy Weingarten attacks the man exposing the wreckage that she helped leave behind. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=213.0s)]
*  So the question is, why is an un-elected person who is taking this information, private information, from people who have trusted the Department of Education to give them their financial information? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=224.0s)]
*  That, to me, is the scariest thing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=239.0s)]
*  Nobody elected Donald Trump or Elon Musk to take their private information. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=242.0s)]
*  Let's hope high school students know more about civics than Randy does. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=247.0s)]
*  First, Donald Trump is the chief executive of something Ms. Weingarten called the executive branch. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=253.0s)]
*  And the staff that he appoints in senior roles have the duly delegated authority of him to use data to determine program efficacy, not to intrude in people's lives. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=260.0s)]
*  But we don't need an audit, really, to know how badly the Department of Education has failed our children. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=272.0s)]
*  It's self-evident. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=278.0s)]
*  All our parents, fathers, mothers! [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=280.0s)]
*  We will honor all our mothers! [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=285.0s)]
*  Recall that on the way out the door, President Obama urged young people to engage in community organizing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=290.0s)]
*  After all, he did. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=298.0s)]
*  And it's really a socialist's highest calling, including on the Hill. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=300.0s)]
*  Popular protest is going to become very important here, and it's going to look very different from the first Trump administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=304.0s)]
*  The decentralized local protests around particular departments, particular agencies, in particular towns and cities, are going to proliferate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=310.0s)]
*  We're going to stop them, and we're going to use every means available to us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=318.0s)]
*  By any means necessary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=322.0s)]
*  Well, rules for radicals. Saul Alinsky would be very proud of what he's hearing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=325.0s)]
*  And remember, Democrats are all about just a few things. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=331.0s)]
*  They're experts in a few things. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=335.0s)]
*  Protesting and partying, all on your dime. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=337.0s)]
*  So what department or agency might be under the microscope next? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=342.0s)]
*  Or under the Doge guillotine? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=346.0s)]
*  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=349.0s)]
*  Well, Elon tweeted today that the CFPB RIP rest in peace. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=351.0s)]
*  What about HUD? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=358.0s)]
*  What about the EPA, just to name a few? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=359.0s)]
*  Democrats claim America has a housing shortage. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=361.0s)]
*  They keep saying we need more affordable housing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=365.0s)]
*  Well, just think of the number of nifty apartments that could be carved into these old government buildings. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=367.0s)]
*  That's a lot of apartments. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=374.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=377.0s)]
*  Before Doge, there was Bill Clinton. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=379.0s)]
*  He cut 400,000 federal jobs and Al Gore was the executioner. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=381.0s)]
*  This report tells us how to cut waste, cut red tape, streamline the bureaucracy, change procurement rules, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=388.0s)]
*  change the personnel rules, and create a government that works better and costs less. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=396.0s)]
*  The Reinventing Government or Rego Report aims to save $108 billion over five years [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=403.0s)]
*  through eliminating scores of wasteful programs and regulations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=409.0s)]
*  Among the 800 recommendations, eliminating 12% of the federal workforce, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=413.0s)]
*  merging some government agencies like the FBI, the DEA, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=417.0s)]
*  closing hundreds of government offices outside Washington. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=424.0s)]
*  Gore should have fired Monica. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=427.0s)]
*  Would have saved everybody a lot of trouble. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=429.0s)]
*  It wasn't just Clinton and Gore. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=432.0s)]
*  The Messiah said he was on a mission to trim. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=434.0s)]
*  From the day I took office, one of the commitments that I made the American people [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=438.0s)]
*  was that we would do a better job here in Washington in rooting out wasteful spending. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=442.0s)]
*  Now this does mean making some tough choices. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=449.0s)]
*  It means cutting some programs that I think are worthy, but we may not be able to afford right now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=451.0s)]
*  We haven't seen as much action out of Congress as we'd like, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=458.0s)]
*  and that's why we launched on our own initiative the campaign to cut waste. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=461.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=466.0s)]
*  Barack was pro-Doge. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=467.0s)]
*  Now that 65,000 bureaucrats took a buyout from Donald Trump, a very generous buyout, I might add, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=469.0s)]
*  Democrats are getting very insurrection-y. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=475.0s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=479.0s)]
*  You're not coming in. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=480.0s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=481.0s)]
*  And what do you do here? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=482.0s)]
*  I have a security responsibility. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=483.0s)]
*  Get out of the way. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=484.0s)]
*  We pay for your job. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=485.0s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=488.0s)]
*  You're going to beat us up if we go in? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=489.0s)]
*  I mean, you're going to, you know, steamroll me here? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=491.0s)]
*  We're not dangerous people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=494.0s)]
*  There are no thieves and thugs out here. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=495.0s)]
*  We're members of Congress. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=497.0s)]
*  They allow billionaires and his minions to come in, and the kids deserve to have us go in and fight for them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=498.0s)]
*  The children of this country deserve that battle. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=505.0s)]
*  This is a public institution. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=509.0s)]
*  This is not Russia. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=511.0s)]
*  He said he's a federal employee. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=512.0s)]
*  We pay him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=515.0s)]
*  We raise money to make sure that we have a Department of Education. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=516.0s)]
*  He's standing here today blocking the door, and he can't give us a good reason why he's blocking this door. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=521.0s)]
*  Do they have guns on them? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=529.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=531.0s)]
*  Do they have guns? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=532.0s)]
*  We don't have any weapons. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=533.0s)]
*  Are they prepared to shoot us? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=534.0s)]
*  Does this remind you of the other people who have blocked the schoolhouse doors before? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=536.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=541.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=542.0s)]
*  Boy, this is a flashback. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=543.0s)]
*  And this is going to go out in history. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=546.0s)]
*  The man who blocked the doors of the Department of... [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=549.0s)]
*  Hold your face up so they can see you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=553.0s)]
*  Give me that ID again. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=555.0s)]
*  I'm giving you the ID. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=556.0s)]
*  I showed it to you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=557.0s)]
*  To what? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=558.0s)]
*  I showed you the ID. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=559.0s)]
*  You do what? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=560.0s)]
*  I showed you the ID. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=561.0s)]
*  Could you let me see the ID again? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=562.0s)]
*  I'm surprised the Democrats knew where to find the Department of Education, because test scores have been dropping for years, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=565.0s)]
*  and this was the first time they showed up at the Department of Education to stop an audit. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=571.0s)]
*  And Maxine's asking someone for ID so racist. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=577.0s)]
*  Here's the president. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=581.0s)]
*  I see Maxine Waters, a lowlife. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=583.0s)]
*  I see, you know, all these people. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=585.0s)]
*  They don't love our country. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=587.0s)]
*  They don't love our country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=589.0s)]
*  We want great education. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=590.0s)]
*  So they rank 40 countries in education. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=592.0s)]
*  We're ranked dead last. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=594.0s)]
*  Dead last. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=596.0s)]
*  But the good news is we're number one in one category. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=597.0s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=601.0s)]
*  Costs per pupil. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=602.0s)]
*  The more money we spend on education, the more test scores drop. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=604.0s)]
*  Teachers unions are doing all right, not so much the students. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=607.0s)]
*  Congress is spending trillions. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=611.0s)]
*  So Doja's in there to look at the books. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=613.0s)]
*  You're not going to let the people who cook the books come in and scream at you while you crunch the numbers. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=615.0s)]
*  Try doing math with Mad Maxine screaming like a hyena. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=621.0s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=625.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=626.0s)]
*  This is like it letting your kids into the living room while it's getting cleaned. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=627.0s)]
*  Now, they made the mess. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=632.0s)]
*  They're going to have to wait until we're finished. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=634.0s)]
*  Musk has whiz kids running AI accounting algorithms, saving taxpayers billions. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=636.0s)]
*  The correct response is thank you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=642.0s)]
*  We begin tonight with Musk and Big Balls. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=645.0s)]
*  That's the online name, according to Wired magazine, of a teen tech whiz who, along with others, are helping the world's richest man do whatever it is he's doing, dismantling parts of the federal government. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=648.0s)]
*  Yes. So this is a 19 year old high school graduate who has used the unfortunate nickname Big Balls online. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=658.0s)]
*  So that would be one way that we could refer to him. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=666.0s)]
*  He is now working at Musk's behest inside Doge. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=668.0s)]
*  And we looked into his background. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=672.0s)]
*  CNN thinks Big Balls is a villain. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=674.0s)]
*  But if he cuts them off, he's a hero. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=678.0s)]
*  Democrats would rather listen to a random Swedish teen than listen to Big Balls, a genius teen, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=681.0s)]
*  saving us billions. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=687.0s)]
*  We're spending nearly a quarter trillion dollars at the Department of Education and Democrats don't even want us to look under the hood. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=689.0s)]
*  I haven't heard one single person who's upset with President Trump or Mr. Musk talk about what he's found. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=696.0s)]
*  They don't want to talk about the spending, the spending porn, the waste of taxpayer money that he's found. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=709.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the point of all this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=721.0s)]
*  I tell you who is interested. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=724.0s)]
*  The American people. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=726.0s)]
*  Musk isn't in there stealing the money. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=729.0s)]
*  He's catching the folks stealing the money. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=731.0s)]
*  We haven't had anybody look at America's credit card statement for the last 25 years. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=733.0s)]
*  Could you imagine if your wife grabbed the Amex bill out of your hands and said you weren't allowed to look? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=738.0s)]
*  That's Maxine. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=743.0s)]
*  It's childish. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=745.0s)]
*  Time magazine put Musk behind the resolute desk and slapped them on the cover just to tweak Trump. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=747.0s)]
*  Did the president take the bait? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=753.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have a reaction to the new Time magazine cover that has Elon Musk sitting behind your resolute desk? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=756.0s)]
*  Time magazine. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=764.0s)]
*  Is Time magazine still in business? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=766.0s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=768.0s)]
*  Elon's nerd army sleeping at the Eisenhower building, working weekends, sifting through balance sheets. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=770.0s)]
*  Doze just announced and discovered an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the National Institutes of Health, which would have cost $170,000. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=777.0s)]
*  Well, the Fauci exhibit has been defunded. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=785.0s)]
*  No department is safe. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=788.0s)]
*  It's absolutely obscene. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=791.0s)]
*  Dangerous, bad, very costly. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=793.0s)]
*  I mean, virtually every investment made is a con job. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=796.0s)]
*  There's nothing of value to anybody unless there's a kickback scheme going on, which is possible. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=800.0s)]
*  And we're going to be doing more and more of that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=808.0s)]
*  We're going to be looking at Department of Education. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=810.0s)]
*  We're going to be looking at even our military. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=812.0s)]
*  We're going to be looking at tremendous amounts of money, Peter, being spent on things that bear no relationship to anything and have no value. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=814.0s)]
*  We're talking about trillions of dollars. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=822.0s)]
*  It will be, in the end, trillions of dollars being absolutely wasted and perhaps illegally, I would say, certainly in many cases illegally, but perhaps illegally overall. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=824.0s)]
*  Elon started with USAID because it was the most obvious place to start cutting. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=835.0s)]
*  And we heard the fraudsters squeal. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=840.0s)]
*  But some of these departments are going to cooperate, like the Pentagon, which has failed seven audits in a row. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=843.0s)]
*  We are going to focus heavily to ensure that at a bare minimum by the end of four years, the Pentagon passes a clean audit. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=850.0s)]
*  The American taxpayers deserve that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=859.0s)]
*  They deserve to know where their $850 billion go, how it's spent and make sure it's spent wisely. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=862.0s)]
*  It used to be that if you called for an audit, somehow you were undermining the department. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=869.0s)]
*  I believe the exact opposite. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=873.0s)]
*  I believe we are accountable for every dollar we spend and every dollar of waste we find or redundancy is a dollar we can invest somewhere else. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=875.0s)]
*  The EPA is also getting put on Ozempic. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=883.0s)]
*  A hundred environmental justice workers getting pink slips. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=886.0s)]
*  At USAID headquarters is getting a makeover. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=889.0s)]
*  The agency went from 10,000 headcount to 300. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=893.0s)]
*  Biden's USAID chief, Samantha Power, is crying on the tracks of the gravy train. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=896.0s)]
*  You think this is a victory for dictators, autocratic regimes around the world who are competing with the US in Africa, in South America, all around the world for influence? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=902.0s)]
*  What's not even an opinion, they are out relishing this moment and celebrating it, including a statement, an official statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry today. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=912.0s)]
*  So this is a disaster, not just from a humanitarian standpoint, from the standpoint of all the beneficiaries who may in fact die because they won't have access to US resources, but it's a disaster for US national interests and national security. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=924.0s)]
*  US national interests and national security, like what? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=938.0s)]
*  What is the US interest in Juan becoming Juanita in Guatemala? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=941.0s)]
*  How does Burton Ernie and Baghdad help our national security? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=945.0s)]
*  This isn't a victory for dictators. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=949.0s)]
*  USAID money was propping up dictators, the dictators we like. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=952.0s)]
*  And if we didn't like the dictator, USAID money went to regime change. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=957.0s)]
*  This money was just about putting everybody in our pocket and the deep state put the kickback in their pocket. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=961.0s)]
*  We told you how foreign aid goes to coups and color revolutions. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=969.0s)]
*  Well, get this. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=973.0s)]
*  We told you Wednesday that USAID money was used to trigger Trump's impeachment through the CIA whistleblower. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=974.0s)]
*  And now we're finding out that USAID administered the billion dollar loan Biden dangled to Ukraine to get the prosecutor investigating Hunter's company fired. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=979.0s)]
*  USAID doesn't just mess around overseas. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=990.0s)]
*  They've been caught screwing around here. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=994.0s)]
*  USAID coerced big tech to censor freedom of speech. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=996.0s)]
*  They did it right before the 2022 midterms. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1001.0s)]
*  But the most criminal element to this foreign aid scheme is that the math shows its one big kickback racket. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1004.0s)]
*  This here is in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1011.0s)]
*  Some dollars do reach intended recipients around the world, but plenty of the funding goes to local affiliates of those same USAID subcontractors. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1014.0s)]
*  By most assessments, less than 10 percent of U.S. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1025.0s)]
*  nonmilitary foreign aid ends up with locally based organizations. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1029.0s)]
*  Nine out of 10 USAID dollars ends up in the hands of crooked contractors. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1034.0s)]
*  USAID was a taxpayer funded charity scam as well as a regime change bank. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1039.0s)]
*  If a charity operated the way USAID does, but only 10 percent of the money went to feed the kids or save the whales, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1046.0s)]
*  the executives would get arrested. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1053.0s)]
*  The charity would get shut down and everyone would be charged with fraud. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1056.0s)]
*  USAID makes the Clinton Foundation look legit. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1060.0s)]
*  Democrats didn't always defend USAID. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1063.0s)]
*  In the 60s, the hippies used it to protest because it would fund counterinsurgencies in the Third World. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1067.0s)]
*  The New York Times published a searing expose about USAID bribing India to open their markets to American fertilizer exports. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1075.0s)]
*  USAID funneled money to a Laotian general to create a private airline that he used to traffic opium. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1084.0s)]
*  The profits used to finance the war against the Viet Cong. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1092.0s)]
*  USAID is still doing the same thing, but they co-opted the far left by DEI washing the brand. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1096.0s)]
*  Democrats were like, I don't know about propping up all these dictators and funding these coups. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1103.0s)]
*  And USAID was like, guys, some of this money is going to sex change surgeries and DEI operas and green energy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1109.0s)]
*  And they were like, oh, well, in that case, have at it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1116.0s)]
*  On November 5th, America rejected regime change wars, DEI, trans surgeries and the Green New Scam. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1121.0s)]
*  But the Democrats are still not listening to the American people. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1129.0s)]
*  USA Today says perhaps liberals should take a step back and think hard about what they're protesting. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1133.0s)]
*  They aren't just in your face about Trump and Musk. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1139.0s)]
*  They're also fighting the 77.3 million Americans who rejected what the Democrats were selling. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1142.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. What a busy Friday News night. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1150.0s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert moments ago. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1152.0s)]
*  President Trump revoked Joe Biden's security clearance and stopped his daily intelligence briefings on Truth Social. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1154.0s)]
*  President Trump, he posted the following. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1161.0s)]
*  Biden set this precedent in 2021 when he instructed the intelligence community to stop the 45th president of the United States, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1164.0s)]
*  me, from accessing details on national security, a courtesy provided to former presidents. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1172.0s)]
*  The Her report revealed that Biden suffers from poor memory and even in his prime could not be trusted with sensitive information. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1179.0s)]
*  I will always protect our national security. Joe, you're fired tonight. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1187.0s)]
*  President Trump is absolutely right. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1191.0s)]
*  Now, in case you think, oh, this is outrageous. Oh, I can't believe Donald Trump did this. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1194.0s)]
*  OK, let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1200.0s)]
*  I'm sure the fake news legacy media mob state run as it is, is not going to show you this headline from the New York Times. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1203.0s)]
*  We'll remind you 2021, as you can see right there, Biden bars Trump from receiving intelligence briefings, citing erratic behavior. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1212.0s)]
*  Anyway, Biden set the precedent in 2021. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1221.0s)]
*  Joe is obviously in a steep cognitive decline. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1224.0s)]
*  And frankly, after all we know about what he did and leveraging a billion dollars, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1227.0s)]
*  Burisma and Hunter's laptop saying that he paid Pops all this money, I think Donald Trump made the right decision. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1231.0s)]
*  Of course, we would also hate for classified information to end up in Biden's garbage next to his precious Corvette or in a cardboard box. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1238.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Democratic Party is in shambles. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1246.0s)]
*  Not long ago, they lost the White House, the House, the Senate, and now they are humiliating themselves. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1249.0s)]
*  I'll admit it's somewhat entertaining in public and they're doing it daily. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1256.0s)]
*  A few hours ago, with the cameras rolling, congressional Democrats look at this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1260.0s)]
*  They attempted to storm the Department of Education building in D.C. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1265.0s)]
*  Now, this performative stunt was supposed to be a protest against that evil monster who's helping to save you money, Elon Musk and Doge. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1270.0s)]
*  But instead, they spent several minutes harassing a poor security guard at the front door of the building. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1280.0s)]
*  This is your modern, leftist, extreme, radical Democratic Party. Take a good look. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1285.0s)]
*  We're coming in. We're coming in. We're coming in. Don't lock the door. We're coming in. Who are you? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1291.0s)]
*  You're not coming in. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1299.0s)]
*  Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you, sir? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1300.0s)]
*  Do you have business here? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1303.0s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1305.0s)]
*  Get out of the way. We pay for your job. We pay you. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1306.0s)]
*  This is going to go out in history. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1311.0s)]
*  The man who blocked the doors of the Department of Education. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1314.0s)]
*  Get a good copy of him. Let him get recorded in history for what he's doing today. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1323.0s)]
*  Let his children see him. Let his children know that he was standing in the way of all children being educated. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1328.0s)]
*  Look them in the eye. Come on. Hold your face up. Look at them. Let them see you. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1337.0s)]
*  That looked like a threat to me. Oh, everybody in the world, look at this individual. Take a look. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1342.0s)]
*  Shock, denial, depression, and now we can expect four years of irrational rage. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1350.0s)]
*  Just so we are clear, Democrats say they are embarrassing themselves in a desperate attempt to stop Trump and Elon Musk from protecting your money, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1356.0s)]
*  auditing the federal government, eliminating massive waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1365.0s)]
*  Tens, likely hundreds of, not millions, billions of your hard-earned tax dollars wasted on foreign countries. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1370.0s)]
*  We have needs galore in this country. Why aren't we helping Americans out? Why? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1379.0s)]
*  Because they want to spread the gospel of Green New Dealism, wokeism, transgenderism, DEI, while simultaneously failing spectacularly. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1384.0s)]
*  You, the American people, the average American that makes $66,000 a year. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1393.0s)]
*  So now Democrats are dead set against any kind of government accountability. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1398.0s)]
*  And moments ago, President Trump, he just responded. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1402.0s)]
*  Amaro Lago, take a look. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1405.0s)]
*  The Democrats have lost their minds and they've lost their confidence. They have very little confidence. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1407.0s)]
*  They are different people. And they look foolish. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1412.0s)]
*  Today they tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go and check the books. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1416.0s)]
*  And Maxine Waters is a lunatic. And you know, they're all lunatics, frankly. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1421.0s)]
*  They're so, it's so sad to see. They should be happy. They shouldn't be sad. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1426.0s)]
*  Look at this man. Do you, you know, who are you? Get out of my way. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1432.0s)]
*  That how you treat security guards? Keep in mind, the Department of Education was created by Jimmy Carter. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's not that old. And it is a massive failure. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1444.0s)]
*  We spend more per capita as an industrialized country than any other industrialized country with the worst results. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1448.0s)]
*  And under the department, America's education standards have steadily declined. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1454.0s)]
*  We are failing our children. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1460.0s)]
*  But apparently Democrats care more about government and big spending and spending abroad than results for we, the American people. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1462.0s)]
*  Just look at this article from the Washington Post. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1470.0s)]
*  The Post headline reads, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1473.0s)]
*  It continues. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1482.0s)]
*  I'd say that's great. I'd say that's the most consequential, transformational two weeks in presidential history. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1488.0s)]
*  How do you see things so differently? How do you, how do you, how do you juxtapose those interpretations? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1495.0s)]
*  Anyway, the left, they worship government like a religion. Last thing you should count on in government. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1501.0s)]
*  How's government, how's government doing protecting your towns and your cities with defund dismantle? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1506.0s)]
*  They've done a good job protecting your border. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1512.0s)]
*  How's your educational system in your small town or big city doing a good job educating your kids? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1514.0s)]
*  How's that Obamacare thing working out? Keep your doctor plan and save $2,500. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1521.0s)]
*  No, that's right. Millions lost their doctors, their plans, and we're paying about 300% more. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1526.0s)]
*  They have corruptly abused your hard-earned money, the money of the American people. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1531.0s)]
*  They have stolen money from our, from our children and our grandchildren in the process. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1537.0s)]
*  And of course, many on the left benefited from a pretty extensive gravy train because that's their power base. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1543.0s)]
*  But thank you, Elon Musk and Doge. USAID was totally exposed. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1549.0s)]
*  We now know the agency was showering left-wing organizations worldwide with cold, hard cash. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1555.0s)]
*  Compliments of you, but you didn't know about it because they weren't transparent and they hid it from you. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1561.0s)]
*  And now USAID appears to be out of business. Today, the signage, it was removed from the building. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1567.0s)]
*  And Trump plans to cut USAID staff by 97% pending a new lawsuit. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1574.0s)]
*  In a post on X, Doge announced that USAID is now unburdened by what has been and buckle up. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1580.0s)]
*  This is only one agency. This is only the beginning. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1587.0s)]
*  And this is the beginning of the left and their daily, hourly, minute-by-minute freakout. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1592.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and his team, frankly, we owe them a debt of gratitude. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1598.0s)]
*  They're on the case throughout the entire federal government. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1602.0s)]
*  For example, Doge just announced that it found a dozen people receiving Social Security. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1605.0s)]
*  OK, that's sound. Oh, but they're 150 years old. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1611.0s)]
*  Hmm. Government efficiency at its best. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1615.0s)]
*  And in the past 48 hours, thanks to Doge, the Department of Health and Human Services has canceled $182 million in administrative expenses, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1618.0s)]
*  including $168,000 contract for an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the NIH Museum. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1629.0s)]
*  Really? You've got to be kidding. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1639.0s)]
*  Doge is also auditing the Consumer Bureau, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1642.0s)]
*  with plans to fully examine the Department of Education, the Pentagon, and according to President Trump, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1647.0s)]
*  they're going to go through everything. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1653.0s)]
*  And by the way, they should literally turn over every penny, every nickel, before they spend your money. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1655.0s)]
*  If Democrats were smart, if they were honest, if they were not corrupt, they would cheer for what is happening, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1660.0s)]
*  what Elon Musk and his team are doing at Doge. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1666.0s)]
*  They are returning America to its constitutional order. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1669.0s)]
*  What our framers and founders envisioned, limited government, greater freedom, eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1673.0s)]
*  Republicans have lectured us about this for years. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1680.0s)]
*  Now they have a chance to actually do the job. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1683.0s)]
*  And by the way, it shouldn't be a partisan issue. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1685.0s)]
*  We should be good stewards of taxpayer money. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1688.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party is such a pathetic, self-righteous, trainwreck, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1691.0s)]
*  that they're willing to attack anything and everything that Donald Trump supports, whether it's common sense or not. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1695.0s)]
*  It's not going to matter. They lost. Trump won. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1700.0s)]
*  And now the swamp is getting drained, one way or another. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1703.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSAYWLeSc6Y&t=1713.0s)]
