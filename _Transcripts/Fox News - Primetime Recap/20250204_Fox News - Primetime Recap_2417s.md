# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 3, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1.8s)]
*  Tonight, as always, thank you very much [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=3.4s)]
*  for spending some time with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=5.44s)]
*  Turning over the rocks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=7.8s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=9.3s)]
*  When President Trump tasked a willing Elon Musk [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=13.08s)]
*  with making the government more efficient again, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=16.04s)]
*  it was clear that this exercise [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=19.28s)]
*  wouldn't just be performative, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=20.92s)]
*  where they review a few programs, make a few cuts, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=22.68s)]
*  and then just declare victory. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=25.92s)]
*  No. This time, they were serious. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=27.16s)]
*  And what better place to start [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=30.96s)]
*  than the ongoing foreign slush fund known as USAID? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=32.66s)]
*  In shutting down, which we're in the process of doing, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=37.1s)]
*  shutting down USAID, the reason for that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=40.2s)]
*  as opposed to simply trying to do some minor house cleaning, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=42.74s)]
*  is that as we dug into USAID, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=47.1s)]
*  it became apparent that what we have here [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=51.04s)]
*  is not an apple with a worm in it, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=52.84s)]
*  but we have actually just a bowl of worms. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=55.56s)]
*  Mm, yummy. A bowl of worms. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=58.3s)]
*  And once they started turning over the rocks there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=60.64s)]
*  more worms crawled out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=63.04s)]
*  USAID should have been disbanded years ago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=65.18s)]
*  Now, the agency's top recipient of taxpayer dollars, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=68.32s)]
*  that has been plagued by allegations [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=72.12s)]
*  of massive waste, fraud, and abuse for decades. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=74.28s)]
*  And these agencies that benefited [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=77.92s)]
*  rushed to settle with the DOJ after Trump was elected. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=80.06s)]
*  The largest for-profit contractor for USAID [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  agreed to pay the US government 3.1 million, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=88.32s)]
*  and that was related to fraudulent billing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=91.16s)]
*  by a Nigerian subcontractor [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=92.96s)]
*  for a global health supply chain project. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=99.0s)]
*  And now, with the USAID offices at least temporarily shut, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=100.2s)]
*  with all the dead weight laid off, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=104.34s)]
*  just imagine how deep this rot goes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=106.08s)]
*  Now, the Biden years were just an excuse [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=111.14s)]
*  to spread money around to radicals [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=113.56s)]
*  here, there, and everywhere. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=115.2s)]
*  In 2023, USAID sponsored scores of DEI events [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=116.84s)]
*  here and abroad, including my personal favorite. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=121.84s)]
*  I just Googled this and found it today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=124.18s)]
*  One was called Celebrating Women in Waste Management. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  With panels including USAID staff with these titles, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=133.12s)]
*  Senior Gender Advisor for Environment and Climate, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=137.76s)]
*  Social and Behavior Change and Gender Director, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  and Gender Specialist. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=145.68s)]
*  Well, you get the idea. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  This is why it's so critical that DOJ scour [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=150.46s)]
*  every inch of our government, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=153.36s)]
*  every line of the federal register, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=155.72s)]
*  every penny that goes out the door. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Remember, it's your money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=160.36s)]
*  You earned it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  Don't let anyone else waste it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=163.3s)]
*  And also that DOJ notifies the president [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=165.4s)]
*  when staff and spending is unnecessary, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=167.9s)]
*  when it's duplicative, when it's fraudulent, even destructive. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  And of course, when it's not specifically required by law, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  then just eliminate it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and that will inevitably mean entire agencies [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=179.4s)]
*  are zeroed out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=183.06s)]
*  Please zero them out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  And with the runaway agendas, the spending of USAID, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=186.0s)]
*  it's long past time to close down all of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=189.0s)]
*  Congressional oversight, it already found millions [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=192.78s)]
*  of USAID funds going to administrative costs alone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  We got all kinds of threats from USAID [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=200.9s)]
*  because I was trying to exercise [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  my oversight capacity in Congress. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=208.28s)]
*  My staff and I had estimated was that 30 to 40% [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=211.22s)]
*  of the USAID's awards would go to indirect costs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=215.46s)]
*  So their overhead, you know, their rents, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  employees, things like that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Where are they living in the top of the hall? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=226.18s)]
*  But for decades, both the left and some checked out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=229.78s)]
*  Republicans let the agency basically just have its way [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=232.98s)]
*  with little to no one looking over their shoulders. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=238.12s)]
*  And during the Biden and Obama years, the gender, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=241.56s)]
*  the climate, the race activists, they just went to town. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=244.2s)]
*  They went totally crazy what they were doing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=248.24s)]
*  And the money they were giving to people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=250.6s)]
*  that shouldn't be getting it into agencies [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=253.38s)]
*  and others that shouldn't be getting it was a shame. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=256.44s)]
*  So a tremendous fraud. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=258.42s)]
*  And as anyone who has spent time on a farm knows, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=262.06s)]
*  when you fill the pig trough every day [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=265.42s)]
*  and you fill it with better and better food, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=268.02s)]
*  well, the animals, they expect that food no matter what. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=270.4s)]
*  And when they don't get their food, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  especially if they require time, they start squealing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=275.4s)]
*  We talked about Trump wanting to be a dictator on day one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=280.4s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=286.0s)]
*  This is what the beginning of dictatorship looks like. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  When you got the constitution and you install yourself [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=293.12s)]
*  as the sole power, that is how dictators are made. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what Elon Musk's motivations are. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=303.38s)]
*  I don't know what his purposes are, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  but they've got nothing to do with what has been [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=309.16s)]
*  lawfully adopted by the people of the United States [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=312.04s)]
*  of America through the Congress of the United States. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna defend USAID all the way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=318.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, USAID was actually created in 1961 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  by JFK via executive order. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=327.92s)]
*  And that was after he signed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  the Foreign Assistance Act into law. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  And as the chief executive of our government, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=334.8s)]
*  Donald J. Trump has the responsibility [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=337.9s)]
*  to safeguard our economic wellbeing, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=341.0s)]
*  which is now being jeopardized [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=343.38s)]
*  by these types of fraudulent programs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=346.02s)]
*  And they're all across the government, by the way. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=348.34s)]
*  This is just literally scratching the surface. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=350.2s)]
*  Of course, actually cutting the fat out of government, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=353.5s)]
*  well, that might as well be a war crime, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=357.28s)]
*  according to the press. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=359.38s)]
*  You wanna authorize purging of State Department personnel? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=361.02s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, if you wanna take a look at the State Department, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=367.34s)]
*  where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=369.46s)]
*  diplomacy in many accounts, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=372.06s)]
*  I can give you hundreds of examples [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=373.73999999999995s)]
*  of where they were authorized. What proof do you have [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  of that? Sure, let's list them off. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=376.06s)]

*  not Fox. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=884.46s)]

*  What the hell are you doing? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=894.42s)]
*  What? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=895.58s)]
*  That's Heinz ketchup. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=896.42s)]
*  So? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=897.38s)]
*  It's American. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=898.22s)]
*  Buy French's, it's Canadian. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=900.14s)]
*  We're in a trade war, you traitor. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=902.22s)]

*  Over 75% of Canadian exports come here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=919.62s)]
*  They can't win a trade war with us. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=923.94s)]

*  We give them protection, military protection. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=934.14s)]
*  We don't need them to build our cars. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=937.46s)]
*  I'd rather see Detroit or South Carolina [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=940.06s)]

*  any one of our states build the cars. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=945.42s)]
*  They could do it very easily. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=947.14s)]
*  We don't need them for the cars. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=948.14s)]
*  We don't need them for lumber. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=949.42s)]
*  We don't need them for anything. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=951.26s)]
*  We don't need them for energy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=952.9s)]

*  Why are we willing to lose between 100 billion [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=960.06s)]
*  and 200 billion dollars a year? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=964.0999999999999s)]
*  We don't need them. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=965.78s)]
*  But before I even got on the set for the five, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=966.8599999999999s)]

*  enhanced coordination with our American partners [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=982.1s)]

*  Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=988.02s)]

*  Canada caved. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=994.86s)]
*  And in exchange, Trump paused tariffs for 30 days. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=996.06s)]
*  There was no inflation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1000.1s)]
*  There was no recession. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1001.5s)]
*  The market closed pretty much flat. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1003.5s)]
*  But we've been told tariffs don't work [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1006.5s)]

*  And if tariffs are eventually enacted, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1018.02s)]
*  American consumers have a choice. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1019.9s)]
*  We don't have to pay for Corona. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1022.02s)]
*  We can buy bud, just not Bud Light. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1024.66s)]

*  They don't take anything. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1073.26s)]

*  Never happened. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1481.54s)]
*  Panama also, now they're caving to Donald Trump's pressure, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1482.74s)]

*  Another massive victory for Donald Trump. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1497.94s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1500.58s)]
*  Denmark is still insisting that Greenland is not for sale, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1501.62s)]

*  expanding our military presence on the island. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1507.82s)]
*  And by the way, they might be having a referendum there soon, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1511.06s)]
*  and maybe the people get to vote themselves, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1514.3799999999999s)]
*  and I'm pretty sure that the US would win that battle. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1516.98s)]

*  without killing a single civilian. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1537.38s)]

*  Tariffs are very powerful, both economically [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1571.74s)]

*  Disgraced ex-New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=1993.1s)]

*  Since the pandemic, American students have fallen [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2008.7s)]

*  And that weekend I spent at San Quentin. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2048.86s)]
*  Scientists are using genetic engineering to create mice [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2054.78s)]
*  with two male parents. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2060.1s)]
*  It's all part of a bigger plan [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2063.14s)]
*  to create mice who love musicals. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2064.42s)]
*  And on the view, Joy Behar claims [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2071.62s)]
*  the new White House press secretary got her job [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2073.46s)]
*  because she's a 10. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2075.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joy is on the view because she's a ton. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  But Joy's right, Caroline Levin is a 10. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2088.3s)]
*  But also 10, the amount of beers it takes [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2091.98s)]
*  for a homeless guy to have sex with Joy Behar. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2094.9s)]
*  Not homeless takes 100. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2103.62s)]
*  All right, so right now the Democratic Party [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2106.38s)]
*  is finding itself in a very uncomfortable spot. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2108.34s)]
*  And no, I don't mean in a men's room stall [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2112.5s)]
*  next to a very lactose intolerant Bernie Sanders. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2114.7000000000003s)]
*  No, the Dems are screwed because the Republicans [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2119.5s)]
*  have pulled the high ground maneuver [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2121.7400000000002s)]
*  by becoming the party of common sense. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2124.78s)]
*  Which means anything that might challenge that [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2126.94s)]
*  has to be the opposite, as in bat sh** crazy. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2129.94s)]
*  Because parties are about differentiation [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2134.38s)]
*  and how do you differentiate from sane? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2137.3s)]
*  See, by staking out the common sense middle, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2141.1000000000004s)]
*  i.e. public safety and actual border, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2143.42s)]
*  cutting a bloated federal budget, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2145.7400000000002s)]
*  the Republicans have put the Dems in the crazy corner. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2148.1400000000003s)]
*  They're stuck, now at odds with basic truths [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2152.06s)]
*  Americans desire. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2155.3s)]
*  It was always the case, but now it's really transparent. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2157.1000000000004s)]
*  And if any Democrat tries to deal [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2160.46s)]
*  a common sense card himself, like say, Fetterman, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2162.58s)]
*  then you now look a whole lot like a Republican. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2166.62s)]
*  Although most Republicans, they wear pants. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2170.14s)]
*  So if you're the Dems, where do you go? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2174.5s)]
*  The majority of Americans, they're ready to tell them. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2177.02s)]
*  The latest poll has the Dems at 31% approval. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2180.38s)]
*  Can you imagine anyone being that unpopular? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2183.94s)]
*  I mean, we can do that too, Joy, right? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2188.38s)]
*  You know who else wore white? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2191.18s)]
*  Hitler. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2194.14s)]
*  But at no time in recent history [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2195.98s)]
*  has the Democratic Party been more reviled. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2197.7s)]
*  And they once ran this for president. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2200.74s)]
*  So the Dems are stuck. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2207.22s)]
*  With the high ground now so far out of reach, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2208.98s)]
*  they need to find out what's left for them, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2211.38s)]
*  because they're not going to be able to do it. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2213.1s)]
*  And with the high ground now so far out of reach, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2215.14s)]
*  they need to find out what's left for them, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2217.02s)]
*  because their entire world view has been rejected, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2218.8199999999997s)]
*  like me at an Ugly Persons Conference. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2221.46s)]
*  And that's because the general public gets common sense. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2224.5s)]
*  In fact, you could hate Republicans and still say, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2230.06s)]
*  you know, I like what they're doing with immigration [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2233.2599999999998s)]
*  and crime and trance. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2235.1s)]
*  It's just common sense. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2236.2599999999998s)]
*  That's why so many new demographics have shifted right. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2237.9s)]
*  The right gained ground with every voting block, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2240.94s)]
*  As a result, the Dems now have no way to dissent [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2244.34s)]
*  without being against common sense. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2247.7s)]
*  Take the illegal raids. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2250.5s)]
*  Sure, some lefties scream racism, but the public hears, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2252.22s)]
*  wait, they're deporting violent migrant criminals? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2255.62s)]
*  I'm for that, and I'm Mexican. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2258.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2260.54s)]
*  True. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2261.34s)]
*  True. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2262.14s)]
*  True. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2263.94s)]
*  You know, many people of color actually [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2264.74s)]
*  live in these neighborhoods. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2270.3s)]
*  I know, because I go there to teach at-risk youth CPR. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2271.94s)]
*  And what about trans? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2280.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, would you want your daughter playing junior high [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2281.82s)]
*  basketball against a dude who's taller, stronger, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2283.82s)]
*  and heavier by 30 pounds? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2285.9s)]
*  Do you think children who can't spell transgender [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2287.82s)]
*  should be having their bodies permanently altered [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2289.98s)]
*  like they're a suit off the rack at men's warehouse? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2292.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, the odds of genuine gender dysphoria [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2295.58s)]
*  actually happening naturally are about the same [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2298.66s)]
*  as Nancy Pelosi's face. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2301.54s)]
*  It has to be created. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2305.54s)]
*  The common sense answer, supported by most Americans, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2310.06s)]
*  leaves the left with nowhere to go. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2313.14s)]
*  On crime, same thing. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2315.74s)]
*  Whatever your party affiliation, common sense [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2316.98s)]
*  means you want your loved ones coming home at night [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2319.02s)]
*  in the same shape they left in, even if it is [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2321.7s)]
*  the shape of a beanbag chair. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2325.1s)]
*  Is there anything sadder than watching [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2329.58s)]
*  liberal mayors and governors trying [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2331.66s)]
*  to defend murderers, rapists, and child traffickers? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2333.5s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2335.98s)]
*  And what can the left say when only 6% of DC workers [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2337.42s)]
*  actually go to work? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2341.7799999999997s)]
*  Besides, get your lazy ass into the office. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2343.58s)]
*  Especially when thousands of government buildings [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2351.18s)]
*  sit empty like a meeting of the Jim Acosta fan club. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2354.3399999999997s)]
*  Is there any way to oppose that and not sound like a nut [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2358.62s)]
*  and risk being hired by MSNBC? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2364.7s)]
*  The truth is the woke world took over the Democratic Party [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2367.94s)]
*  and so common sense was there for the taking [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2371.54s)]
*  and Trump took it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2373.94s)]
*  And now the Dems are on the outside looking in [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2375.2999999999997s)]
*  like Joe Biden at a mausoleum. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2377.42s)]
*  See, the Dems can't be the other party of common sense. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2384.1s)]
*  That lane is occupied. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2387.94s)]
*  And it all happened because the Dems were in a competition [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2390.42s)]
*  to outwoke each other, allowing Trump to make it safe [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2392.9s)]
*  for common sense again, which means the left is left [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2396.06s)]
*  with defending things that are obviously bad for the country, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2399.9s)]
*  which now includes the party. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2403.26s)]
*  Let's welcome, Mary! [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4RXb7GAzU&t=2404.7400000000002s)]
