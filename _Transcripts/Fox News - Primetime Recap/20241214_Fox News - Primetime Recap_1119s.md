# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 13, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY)
*  There's a dinosaur loose in DC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the question then becomes, does this knowledge that he has, does that mean that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=4.0s)]
*  he will be more Reaganesque in his delivery, or is it like the velociraptor who tests the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=9.0s)]
*  door in Jurassic Park and then is now figuring out how he can more successfully wreak havoc? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=15.68s)]
*  Right, several people who have worked for him over the years have used the Jurassic [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=20.84s)]
*  Park analogy, so I think that seems... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=24.16s)]
*  Yes, I didn't make it up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=25.8s)]
*  Compasaurus Rex is coming to town and he's not coming alone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=27.8s)]
*  He's bringing Stegosaurus and Triceratops. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=31.16s)]
*  This is the first time that I can remember in modern history at least that I've been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=34.64s)]
*  in the United States and following US politics where such an enormous number of business [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=40.32s)]
*  people have been motivated to come and work inside of the administration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=45.84s)]
*  I think that the Democrats would never have assembled a group of people like this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  The reality is that the United States economy is too complicated to be managed by theoreticians, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=54.88s)]
*  by folks with random PhDs and absolutely no working experience in the real world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  And when you bring those people in to oversee those PhDs, I think you probably get better [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=66.84s)]
*  outcomes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=72.0s)]
*  Aren't you sick of a government run by politicians, professors, and economists? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=73.0s)]
*  You know, people with no real life experience, they don't know how things work. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=77.12s)]
*  This time is different. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=81.48s)]
*  We're bringing in men and women who know how to create things from scratch and build stuff [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=83.36s)]
*  within a budget. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=87.6s)]
*  And if they don't get results, get fired. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=88.6s)]
*  This is the most real American cabinet the country's ever seen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=91.6s)]
*  Elon Musk says we're about to experience the most dramatic transformation since the nation's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=95.08s)]
*  founding. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=100.4s)]
*  What a lucky time to be alive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=101.4s)]
*  Now people have come into Washington before promising change and have gotten chewed up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=104.56s)]
*  and spit out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=109.42s)]
*  The nation's very hard to change. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=111.4s)]
*  The founders devised a system of government of checks and balances, so change is slow. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=113.56s)]
*  But this time just feels different. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=122.48s)]
*  I would say is, you know, you should never bet against Elon and, and isn't there, you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=123.48s)]
*  know, we all know there's an extraordinary amount of waste and it is unsustainable. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  There are two ways to resolve them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=135.12s)]
*  You can, you know, you can cut spending and cut waste or you can raise taxes massively. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=136.84s)]
*  And I take this election in the U.S. for standing for the proposition we're not going to go [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=143.8s)]
*  the European style socialist route of having massive tax hikes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=148.76s)]
*  And then that suggests, you know, you need to try something like the Doge thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=152.76s)]
*  And that's actually what is going to happen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=158.32s)]
*  There's a muted panic rippling through D.C. Democrats are concerned that Trump's coming [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=160.96s)]
*  in with more experience and with a team that understands the levers of government in a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  way that can shape the government to their will. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=170.06s)]
*  Some Democrats are starting to get doge curious. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=173.2s)]
*  Trump and Elon are finding a wellspring of unexpected cooperation from Democrats in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=176.54s)]
*  House. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=181.26s)]
*  Democrats are even pitching ideas like, how about we shrink Homeland Security? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  Well how about it? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=187.1s)]
*  Another Democrat has been pitching the idea of moving all federal agencies out of D.C. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=188.68s)]
*  and sending them all over the country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=193.26s)]
*  Trump loves that idea. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=195.38s)]
*  So do we. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  One Democrat admits there are so many inefficiencies, so many layers of government and wants to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  help. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  We've actually never witnessed this many Democrats get on board with streamlining government [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  ever. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  And it's making bureaucrats really uncomfortable. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=211.18s)]
*  I had a conversation with a deputy secretary of defense where we were talking about the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  The Pentagon's not the only department getting audited. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=219.18s)]
*  Every agency is getting audited. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=248.9s)]
*  Biden spent $3 billion to build 93 electric mail trucks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  That comes to $32 million per mail truck. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=258.5s)]
*  You've seen a mail truck. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=262.38s)]
*  They work fine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  You get your mail, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  A Formula One race car doesn't cost $32 million. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=266.74s)]
*  Not even half that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=269.74s)]
*  This is why there's inflation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=271.52s)]
*  He's spending $32 million per mail truck. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=273.22s)]
*  You know who got the contract? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  Oshkosh Defense, a defense contractor from Wisconsin. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=278.66s)]
*  Swing state. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  What's a defense contractor doing making electric mail trucks? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  Because they know how to win contracts and bilk the feds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=288.3s)]
*  That's why this company Oshkosh Defense was supposed to build 60,000. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=291.1s)]
*  They only built 93. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  The CEO, John Pfeiffer, says he's really happy with the progress. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=299.1s)]
*  The guy's a Democrat donor, by the way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=303.5s)]
*  If you had given this contract to Musk, we'd be done by now with money left over. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=306.22s)]
*  Biden spent a billion dollars on DEI grants. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=311.38s)]
*  What even is a DEI grant? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=316.66s)]
*  What is it, reparations? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=318.74s)]
*  Or the University of Honolulu has a DEI program. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=320.86s)]
*  Here's 20 million. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=323.5s)]
*  Blow it on a luau. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=324.5s)]
*  Did the National Action Network get a DEI grant? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=327.22s)]
*  Because you know Al applied for it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=329.5s)]
*  We found out $170 million went to DEI mental health training. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=332.82s)]
*  What's that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=340.06s)]
*  Is that sensitivity training for whites or therapy sessions for blacks? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=341.06s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=345.5s)]
*  They won't tell us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=346.5s)]
*  A billion dollars. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=348.46s)]
*  This is why bacon's 11 bucks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=349.94s)]
*  And you know what happened this year? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=352.82s)]
*  All these companies dropped their DEI programs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=354.38s)]
*  It was one big waste of a billion dollars. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=357.78s)]
*  DEI went bankrupt. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=359.78s)]
*  Biden's been having a fire sale down at the border. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=362.38s)]
*  He stopped building Trump's wall and started selling scrap metal for pennies on the dollar. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=365.94s)]
*  You can bid for the wall leftovers. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=371.42s)]
*  Bidding starts at five bucks per steel bollard. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=373.78s)]
*  Biden knows what Trump's going to need and it's more steel to restart the wall. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=377.34s)]
*  But he's selling it on Facebook Marketplace. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=382.3s)]
*  So the taxpayers take a bath. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=385.1s)]
*  And Trump has to pay full price next year, meaning you do. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=386.7s)]
*  So they're selling border wall and other Democrats are harboring illegal alien gang [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=391.78s)]
*  bangers so Trump can't deport them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  Here's the borders are. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=399.05999999999995s)]
*  They can sit back and watch us, which again, I find incredible. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  You don't want to take public safety threats out of your community to help us. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  But there are laws on the books that we will, we will prosecute. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=407.46s)]
*  I've arrested US citizens for harboring an alien in their home or place of employment. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=410.97999999999996s)]
*  If I can do it to a citizen, why can't I do it to a politician who's going to actively [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=415.38s)]
*  get in our way, prevent us from doing our job? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=420.3s)]
*  Jose from Venezuela, who's got a knack for sex trafficking, has face tattoos. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=422.26s)]
*  Democrats are going to stop Tom Homan from picking that bad ombre up and putting them [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=428.62s)]
*  on a plane home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  They're really going to do that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=433.14s)]
*  Primetime has a policy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=434.94s)]
*  If you're an illegal alien with a face tattoo, you're out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=436.42s)]
*  I don't even need to see your rap sheet. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=439.92s)]
*  We know you have one. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=441.54s)]
*  We have enough to worry about with drones flying all over the place. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=443.62s)]
*  The sitting president hasn't even said a word. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=447.12s)]
*  No surprise. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=450.16s)]
*  But Trump just beat him to the punch. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=451.96s)]

*  So there's a silver lining. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=599.96s)]
*  So what's happening now is Trump has the wind at its back and no one's stepping up to challenge him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=602.0400000000001s)]

*  I mean, he is dominating coverage. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=613.52s)]
*  He is being feted. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=616.1600000000001s)]

*  He doesn't have a leader right now stepping forward during this vacuum. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=620.08s)]
*  And I think Trump's having a honeymoon. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=625.24s)]

*  Good news. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=646.08s)]

*  Joe Biden, along with his entire pathetic administration, they will be out of the White House and not a moment, frankly, too soon. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=653.48s)]
*  After trying to put his chief political rival in prison with a weaponized DOJ, Biden will [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=661.12s)]
*  hand over the keys to Donald Trump, whether they like it or not, and leave office as the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=666.5200000000001s)]
*  worst, most corrupt, most incompetent, most divisive one-term president in modern American history. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=672.36s)]
*  And his final act as commander in chief, well, is very much on brand. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  Instead of working to make the country a better place in his final days in office, Joe Biden [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=685.7600000000001s)]
*  is solely focused on sabotaging the incoming Trump administration while also making some [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  very dumb and frankly, even dangerous decisions. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't seem to make any sense at all to anybody, does it, except them? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=700.64s)]
*  All vengeance. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, for example, according to reports, Biden is now trying to quickly offload construction [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  materials that you paid for that were to be used for the border wall that they stopped building. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=711.36s)]
*  They're selling them at really low discount prices. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=721.48s)]
*  That will force the incoming administration to spend more of your money to buy the new [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  materials to complete the wall that Donald Trump says he's going to complete, and he will complete. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=727.72s)]
*  He thinks he's hurting Trump. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=734.12s)]
*  What all he's really doing here is wasting your money, all of it, spiteful vengeance. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=735.84s)]
*  At the same time, Biden just made it easier for illegal immigrants during his final weeks [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=743.04s)]
*  in office, allowing them to bypass in-person ICE check-ins with a new app. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=748.08s)]
*  And according to reports, he is now letting in as many illegal immigrants, unvetted, of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=753.48s)]
*  course, as possible to thwart the Trump agenda. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=759.16s)]
*  What, more murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=763.36s)]
*  Huh, let's see, more drug dealers. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=768.0s)]
*  Is that what he's doing? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=771.9599999999999s)]
*  More terrorists? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=773.24s)]
*  And now, not only is our southern border a disaster, but illegal crossings from Canada, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=774.52s)]
*  they too are skyrocketing, and you have hundreds of terrorist suspects that have been arrested. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=779.98s)]
*  Biden is not only leaving Trump with wide open borders, but he is creating the greatest [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=785.9s)]
*  national security nightmare danger to all of you, and that's waiting to happen. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=790.66s)]
*  I hope it doesn't. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=796.98s)]
*  Overseas, Biden is actively sabotaging Donald Trump's upcoming peace efforts. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=798.46s)]
*  He knows that Trump wants negotiated settlements in the Middle East. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=803.84s)]
*  He knows he wants them in Europe. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=807.58s)]
*  He's supplying now Joe Biden as Ukraine with long-range missiles and escalating a conflict [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=809.48s)]
*  that pretty much has long been a stalemate. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  He also, by the way, pumped another 20 billion of your hard-earned tax dollars, your money, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=818.52s)]
*  into Ukraine to help prolong this conflict. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=824.14s)]
*  Now, since the fall of the Soviet Union, we have never been this close to a nuclear war. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  Even Vladimir Putin changed his nuclear policy because of the weapons that Joe Biden is giving [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  Zelensky in Ukraine. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=838.8399999999999s)]

*  of America's nuclear arsenal. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=847.04s)]

*  And meanwhile, in the Middle East, the U.S. is currently targeting Syria with a barrage [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=853.0s)]

*  That's your children's debt and your grandchildren's debt. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=892.56s)]
*  And over at the DOJ, a watchdog was, quote, struck by the sheer magnitude of new hires [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=895.88s)]
*  as the Biden administration is trying to, quote, Trump-proof the DOJ by hiring permanent [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=903.16s)]
*  appointees to some federal positions. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=910.52s)]
*  And of course, the White House is trying to ram through federal judges at a record pace. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=913.12s)]
*  And Joe is also now reportedly considering preemptive pardons for many of his friends [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=917.76s)]
*  in the Washington swamp. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  That would include people you know, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney, Dr. Anthony Fauci. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=924.6s)]
*  Benny Thompson is begging to be on the list as well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=930.64s)]

*  Are they trying to hide something? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=938.84s)]
*  Did they lie? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=941.16s)]

*  But we're supposed to believe that the people that raided Trump's house spied on his communications [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=948.0400000000001s)]

*  Nearly a hundred cooked up felonies as he was running for president. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=954.76s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, they're worried about a weaponized DOJ? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=959.08s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=964.48s)]
*  Maybe they fear what they did to Donald Trump and others. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=965.48s)]
*  Maybe they're fearing that will be done to them. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=969.96s)]
*  I don't think it should be, but probably that's what they're thinking. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=973.24s)]
*  The hypocrisy, duplicity from the Biden administration is almost, it's believable, but almost [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=977.36s)]
*  unbelievable. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  Now this might be the most dishonest, the least transparent White House in American history. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=984.6400000000001s)]
*  So, the drone or flying object or the thing that people describe as a big bus that sounds [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=990.1600000000001s)]
*  like a Harley story that emerged this week is right on par. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=996.6400000000001s)]
*  There are now hundreds, maybe even thousands of credible accounts. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  There's plenty of videos, plenty of pictures showing these very large, very sophisticated [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1006.24s)]
*  objects flying at very low altitudes over the U.S. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1011.28s)]
*  In fact, New Jersey Senator Andy Kim went with local law enforcement last night. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1016.2s)]
*  He filmed it himself. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1021.36s)]
*  He put it on X. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1023.36s)]
*  Quote, we saw a few that looked like they were moving in small clusters of two to four. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1024.88s)]
*  Now we clearly saw several that would move horizontally and then immediately switch back [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1030.6s)]
*  in the opposite direction in maneuvers that planes just can't do. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1035.94s)]
*  And he continued, quote, officers said that they tried to get a closer look with a helicopter, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1040.58s)]
*  but that the drones would turn off their lights and go dark if approached. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1047.06s)]
*  Even while he's not the smartest guy in the world, but even their governor in New Jersey [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  finally reached out to the Biden administration and demanded more concrete information. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1054.86s)]
*  The first sighting was November the 18th, but so far the Biden White House is still [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1061.54s)]
*  pretending not to have any answers at all whatsoever and even suggested that nothing [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1066.06s)]
*  is actually happening. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1072.06s)]
*  Make no mistake, something's going on. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1074.06s)]
*  The administration in all likelihood knows what it is. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1076.54s)]
*  And if they don't know, that would trouble me even more. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1081.22s)]
*  That would be downright scary. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1085.5800000000002s)]
*  And if they're lying, well, that would just be par for the course. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1087.8s)]
*  So let's assume they're lying, you know, to our faces because, well, they don't value [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1090.8s)]
*  or respect the American people. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1096.78s)]
*  And that is exactly why Democrats got wiped out in November and why Biden is now considered [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  probably the worst president in the modern era. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZbTAage8pY&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
