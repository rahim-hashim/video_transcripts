# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 13, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo)
*  All right, kids, it's time for accountability. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2.2s)]
*  All right, Washington isn't just melting down [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=3.92s)]
*  over Trump's pick of Matt Gaetz for AG. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=7.8s)]
*  Defenders of the military industrial complex [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=10.68s)]
*  are also opposing Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=12.92s)]
*  Trump's choice for secretary of defense. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=15.38s)]
*  He is the most unqualified candidate [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=17.56s)]
*  for this position in the history of America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=19.68s)]
*  This is very dangerous. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=21.72s)]
*  I'm not surprised that he picked a Fox News host [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=23.04s)]
*  rather than someone who is gonna understand [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=26.72s)]
*  the seriousness of the moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=28.9s)]
*  Our military has always been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=30.18s)]
*  apolitical, nonpartisan patriots, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=32.86s)]
*  not a political military. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=36.58s)]
*  This is exactly what we worried about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=39.1s)]
*  and we warned about Donald Trump, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  which is that he is going to appoint unqualified loyalists [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=43.46s)]
*  to shape this government into his own personal fiefdom [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=48.94s)]
*  and get revenge on generals. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=53.82s)]
*  Well, what Democrats hope for, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=57.9s)]
*  what they've become accustomed to, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=60.14s)]
*  is a sec def or chairman of the joint chiefs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=62.4s)]
*  who will be a bulwark against the president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=64.86s)]
*  That's why they love Mark Milley, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=67.58s)]
*  who is the chairman of the joint chiefs under Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=69.2s)]
*  Remember in testimony on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=71.58s)]
*  he recounted a phone call he had after January 6th [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=73.44s)]
*  with Nancy Pelosi, during which she expressed concern [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=76.92s)]
*  about Trump's ability to launch a nuclear war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=80.17999999999999s)]
*  She was concerned and made various personal references [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=83.7s)]
*  characterizing the president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=88.7s)]
*  I repeatedly assured her that there is no chance [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=90.02s)]
*  of an illegal, unauthorized or accidental launch. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=93.3s)]
*  By law, I am not in the chain of command and I know that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=96.86s)]
*  I am in the chain of communication [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=100.82s)]
*  to fulfill my legal statutory role [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=103.14s)]
*  as the president's primary military advisor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, Milley was the establishment's best hope [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=109.8s)]
*  for Trump proofing our defense policy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=112.34s)]
*  You could hear the condescension in his voice. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=114.78s)]
*  This is why Hegseth worries them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Who'll be their stopgap now? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  Trump's going for the Pentagon first [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=122.18s)]
*  because it's the Pentagon that stopped him last time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=123.62s)]
*  This is where Milley held the line. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=125.94s)]
*  That's why he's going to the Pentagon [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=127.66s)]
*  and the defense industry first [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=129.12s)]
*  because it's the most formidable resistance [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=130.3s)]
*  to what he wants to execute. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=132.7s)]
*  Of course, he said it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=134.34s)]
*  They want resistance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=136.06s)]
*  That's why they like people like Milley. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=137.5s)]
*  These supposed defenders of norms and protocol, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=140.1s)]
*  they've forgotten that the president, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  not the secretary of defense, is the commander in chief. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=145.46s)]
*  The Pentagon chief is supposed to carry out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=148.7s)]
*  the president's defense priorities, not disrupt them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, legitimate questions about a nominee's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  relevant experience, that's par for the course. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=156.42s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=158.5s)]
*  But the argument that a nominee is not qualified [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=159.62s)]
*  because he's aligned with the president on policy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  is ludicrous and that's going to fail. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=166.34s)]
*  So have Democrats learned nothing here? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=169.02s)]
*  They tried to stop Trump's re-election [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=171.02s)]
*  with these types of generic hyperbolic attacks [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=173.46s)]
*  for the past three years, well, really the past nine years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=176.02s)]
*  How did that work out for them? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=179.02s)]
*  And let's face it, the Pentagon needs major reform. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  It's lurched from one disaster after another, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  from the Iraq War to the Afghanistan War [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  to the deadly pullout from Afghanistan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, it goes without saying that we love our troops. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=193.36s)]
*  They're selfless service, they're patriotism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=196.38s)]
*  But it is a sad fact that our military leadership, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=199.54s)]
*  the Pentagon bureaucracy, and decades and decades [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  upon decades of failure, that has put us [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=206.3s)]
*  in a dangerous and compromised situation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=209.22s)]
*  You don't think China and Russia know that we're nowhere near [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=212.38s)]
*  our needed recruitment levels right now? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=215.34s)]
*  Three of the four service branches [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  failed to recruit enough service members through 2023. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  The Army's short 10,000 soldiers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=222.5s)]
*  That's a 20% shortfall. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=224.9s)]
*  But at least they're on top of your preferred pronouns. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=227.54s)]
*  Hi, my name is Johnny and I use he, him pronouns. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  Hi, and I'm Conchi and I use she, her pronouns. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=232.9s)]
*  And we're here to talk about pronouns. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=235.58s)]
*  Using the right pronouns is a really simple way [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=237.6s)]
*  to affirm someone's identity. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  It is a signal of acceptance and respect. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=241.94s)]
*  If it's a signal of acceptance and respect, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=245.3s)]
*  how do we go about creating a safe space for everybody? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=247.58s)]
*  A safe space for our military. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=251.66s)]
*  Now, military leaders should be just laser beam focused [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=254.94s)]
*  on defending America's interests. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=257.9s)]
*  But instead, we've seen this over the years, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=260.26s)]
*  they waste time on pet issues of the hard left. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=262.04s)]
*  I would also say that diversity, equity, and inclusion [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=265.38s)]
*  is important to this military now, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=268.5s)]
*  and it will be important in the future. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=271.1s)]
*  On the issue of critical race theory, et cetera, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=272.74s)]
*  I do think it's important, actually, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=275.38s)]
*  for those of us in uniform to be open-minded [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=278.1s)]
*  and be widely read. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=281.9s)]
*  I want to understand white rage, and I'm white, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=283.3s)]
*  and I want to understand it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  He will never, ever live that down. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=287.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, they can't even account for the billions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=290.82s)]
*  that they spend. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=292.74s)]
*  An audit just last month showed that they can't be sure [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=293.58s)]
*  at the Pentagon of the 1.1 billion [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=295.98s)]
*  in the Ukraine supplemental funds, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=299.7s)]
*  that they can't be sure they were used as intended. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=301.82s)]
*  No biggie. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=304.54s)]
*  Of course, some are stuck in a nostalgic trance [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=306.18s)]
*  about our military capability. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=309.1s)]
*  The United States military is stronger today [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=311.14s)]
*  than any time since World War II. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=314.06s)]
*  We are an extraordinarily powerful, battle-hardened country [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  fought in Iraq and fought in Afghanistan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  We have seen what's happened in Ukraine [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=326.18s)]
*  over the past two years or so. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  We have learned a hell of a lot from it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=330.18s)]
*  You talk to anybody across the world, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=332.36s)]
*  they will tell you just how strong we are. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=335.26s)]
*  Okay, huh? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=338.46s)]
*  Now repeated tabletop run-throughs of potential conflicts [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=340.58s)]
*  show that America is repeatedly losing to China. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=343.88s)]
*  The former lawmakers, military leaders, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  policy experts on the Commission on the National Defense [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  Strategy gave us grim news. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=352.74s)]
*  Unclassified public war games suggest that in a conflict [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=355.06s)]
*  with China, the US would largely exhaust [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  its munitions inventories in as few as three to four weeks. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=360.82s)]
*  With some important munitions, anti-ship missiles, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=366.3s)]
*  lasting only a few days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=369.14s)]
*  Once expended, replacing these munitions would take years. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=371.5s)]
*  That is the truth about our current capability. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  So right now, we are not safe. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=379.18s)]
*  The world isn't safe if our military is not seen [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=381.44s)]
*  as a credible deterrent. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  That has to change. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=386.58s)]
*  And President Trump obviously thinks that an outsider [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  who is not beholden to the old guard [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=391.78s)]
*  has the best shot at accomplishing this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=394.5s)]
*  Plus, we know President Trump obviously wants his picks [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=397.22s)]
*  to be effective communicators, especially given [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=399.56s)]
*  how much opposition his agenda is gonna face [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=402.1s)]
*  from the same people who got us into the mess we're in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=405.18s)]
*  Now how this all plays out, it's anyone's guess, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=408.3s)]
*  but the defense establishment has no one to blame [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=410.92s)]
*  but itself for the mess that we find ourselves in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=413.62s)]
*  And fixing this, man, this is not gonna be easy, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=416.66s)]
*  but we do know that those with the perfect DC resumes [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=420.34s)]
*  have repeatedly failed to keep us safe [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=424.7s)]
*  and to advance America's military interests. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=427.58s)]
*  And that is the angle. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=430.58s)]
*  He's back. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=432.46s)]
*  Donald Trump returned to DC today [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  and his first meeting was with Congress. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=435.5s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=438.5s)]
*  This is a very nice gathering. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=439.5s)]
*  Isn't it nice to win? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  It's nice to win. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=442.82s)]
*  It's always nice to win. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  A lot of good friends in this room. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=447.17999999999995s)]
*  So you know we had like historic kind of numbers, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=449.54s)]
*  especially for the president, but we won't get into that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=453.54s)]
*  His whole entourage was there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=457.06s)]
*  Elon Musk got a standing O. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=458.86s)]
*  Elon has been so good. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=462.22s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=464.62s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=465.62s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=466.62s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=467.62s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=468.62s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=469.62s)]
*  Behind closed doors, Trump joked, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=470.62s)]
*  Elon won't go home. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=474.3s)]
*  I can't get rid of him. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=475.86s)]
*  The next stop was the White House. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=477.62s)]
*  Biden Harris staffers raced away from their desks [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=480.06s)]
*  to watch history turn the page. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=482.86s)]
*  It's really stunning. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=485.54s)]
*  Those are Biden staffers. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  They're in the EOB. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  Some of them are lower level. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=492.22s)]
*  Some of them perhaps a little bit higher. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=493.38s)]
*  But they're there to watch a history moment being made [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=495.66s)]
*  that nobody standing there wanted. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=501.66s)]
*  Joe Biden was just as giddy as his staff. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  Donald, congratulations. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=508.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=509.94s)]
*  And looking forward to having a, like we said, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  smooth transition to everything we can [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=514.62s)]
*  to make sure you're accommodating what you need. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=517.1s)]
*  We're gonna get a chance to talk about some of that today. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=519.94s)]
*  So welcome. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=521.78s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=522.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=523.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=525.1s)]
*  And politics is tough and it's, in many cases, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=525.98s)]
*  not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=531.1s)]
*  And I appreciate it very much. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=534.46s)]
*  A transition that's so smooth, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  it'll be as smooth as it can get. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=537.98s)]
*  And I very much appreciate that, Joe. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=540.3399999999999s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=542.78s)]
*  Biden seemed relieved to be passing the torch [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=543.86s)]
*  to Don the dictator. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=546.26s)]
*  Since Kamala lost, we've never seen Joe happier. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=547.86s)]
*  How do you arrest a guy, call him Hitler, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=551.18s)]
*  and almost get him killed, and then when he wins, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=553.02s)]
*  you invite him over for coffee? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=554.86s)]
*  I don't know what goes on in Joe's little head. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=557.3s)]
*  He doesn't either. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=560.86s)]
*  These two guys met for almost two hours. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=562.3s)]
*  And Trump says, we got to know each other again. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=565.02s)]
*  Telling the post, quote, I asked for his views [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=568.06s)]
*  and he gave them to me. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=570.42s)]
*  He was very gracious and it was a really good meeting. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=571.66s)]
*  Binder says it was downright chummy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=574.98s)]
*  Did he get a sense that the issues [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=578.22s)]
*  that he was impressing upon, that any advice he was giving [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=580.46s)]
*  was being well received? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=582.86s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=585.02s)]
*  I think that's why the president was saying, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=585.86s)]
*  was wanting me to let you all know that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=587.42s)]
*  there was a, you know, a very good back and forth. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=590.78s)]
*  Look, they met for more than two hours. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=595.74s)]
*  They met for a very long time, or nearly two hours, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=597.14s)]
*  pardon me, and I think by the length of the meeting [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=600.1s)]
*  tells you that they had an in-depth conversation [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=605.42s)]
*  on an array of issues. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=609.14s)]
*  We hear they talked a lot about the mid-east, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=611.02s)]
*  but what else? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=614.18s)]
*  The last time these two were together in the same room [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=616.18s)]
*  was at the debate. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  They talked a fair amount about playing golf. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=619.54s)]
*  Do you know if a plan was made for them to play golf [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=621.74s)]
*  in President Biden's retirement? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=625.5s)]
*  Actually, that's not the last time they saw each other. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=626.3399999999999s)]
*  They saw each other at September 11th. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=628.02s)]
*  I'm gonna move on. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=629.66s)]
*  Dr. Jill even popped by to hand Trump a handwritten letter [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=632.2199999999999s)]
*  for Melania, who couldn't make it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=635.42s)]
*  And she gave the dictator a nice warm smile. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=638.06s)]
*  Kamala just got the cold shoulder. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=641.02s)]
*  Not everybody in the White House was as happy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=643.78s)]
*  as the Bidens. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=646.06s)]
*  An unnamed Biden official reacting to the meeting [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  with what the F. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  Democrats wanted Biden to be a bridge [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=652.06s)]
*  to the next generation, but he was just a roundabout, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=653.82s)]
*  right back to Trump. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=656.74s)]
*  Now Trump's back in Washington with an overwhelming mandate [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  and the Democrats are squabbling [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=661.7s)]
*  and totally shut out of power. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=663.2600000000001s)]
*  In a secret ballot, Senate Republicans [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=665.1400000000001s)]
*  picked John Thune of North Dakota [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=667.38s)]
*  to be Senate Majority Leader. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=669.62s)]
*  Mitch McConnell's retiring, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  and Trump's cabinet will get a fair shake and a fast track. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=672.98s)]
*  We will do everything we can to process his noms quickly, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=677.38s)]
*  get them installed in their position [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=681.46s)]
*  so they can begin to implement his agenda. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=682.86s)]
*  We learned today Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  for Director of National Intelligence, DNI. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=687.34s)]
*  That's a big role and she'll be on the show in a minute. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=690.86s)]
*  And here's a surprise, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=693.78s)]
*  has been selected to be Trump's Attorney General. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=697.02s)]
*  Gaetz is a sharp tongue lawyer [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=699.98s)]
*  who sat on the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=701.58s)]
*  has tangled with Democrats and Republicans, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=703.7s)]
*  and shines a spotlight on government corruption [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  and weaponization. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=708.74s)]
*  Seems like every time I turn around, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=710.78s)]
*  they're engaged in surveillance or list building [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  or monitoring, and I don't care [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=716.42s)]

*  fly across the country, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=871.6999999999999s)]

*  in the Taliban's hands, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=875.38s)]

*  and hide it from the commander in chief. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=896.3s)]
*  Democrats are suddenly obsessed with specific qualifications [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=899.14s)]

*  We learned that Florida Senator, Vice Senator Marco Rubio [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1119.1s)]

*  longtime ally of Donald Trump, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1155.5s)]

*  at the DOJ of Harris and Biden. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1161.58s)]

*  breathless hysteria on the left has been nonstop. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1165.86s)]

*  who just used the word insane [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1176.02s)]
*  to respond and react to this potential appointment. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1178.22s)]
*  Heads are also exploding at the Justice Department [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1181.6599999999999s)]
*  because this goes against the kind of candidate, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1184.98s)]
*  Republican or Democrat, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1190.4199999999998s)]

*  as we're all watching it unfold in real time, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1198.6999999999998s)]
*  and I'm sure we'll have a lot more opinions on that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1200.7s)]
*  Matt Gaetz has no experience [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1202.78s)]
*  that would lend itself towards running [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1205.82s)]
*  the Department of Justice [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1208.1000000000001s)]
*  and everything that's involved there. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1209.82s)]
*  President Trump is gonna hit the Justice Department [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1211.7s)]
*  with a blowtorch, and Matt Gaetz is that torch. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1214.06s)]
*  We are in pure George Orwell, 1984 land [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1217.1000000000001s)]

*  and we're supposed to believe it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1224.9s)]
*  So Merrick Garland and Obama's wingman, Eric Holder, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1227.54s)]

*  is being opposed by the very people [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1240.74s)]

*  You might recall this, take a look. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1261.18s)]
*  Michelle Obama, I love her, you know. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1263.54s)]
*  She and my wife, like really tight, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1265.58s)]

*  But Michelle says that, you know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1271.42s)]
*  when they go low, we go high. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1272.98s)]

*  That's what this new Democratic Party's about. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1285.5s)]
*  Obama's AG wingman, Eric Holder. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1293.26s)]
*  Of course, that's nothing compared to his actions in office. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1296.22s)]
*  Where was the outrage over Holders? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1299.62s)]
*  Remember the Mexican gun running scheme [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1301.66s)]
*  that led to the murder of a US border patrol agent? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1303.94s)]
*  Where was the hysteria over Holder's [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1307.86s)]
*  secret federal surveillance of reporters at the APO [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1310.02s)]

*  the people putting on the concerts for Kamala Harris [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1567.92s)]

*  They have so overreached so often people are sick of it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1572.72s)]
*  And now they've completely lost the trust [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1577.2s)]

*  He is not well liked by the city's swamp creatures. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1590.4s)]
*  That might be a plus in my book, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1593.24s)]

*  to disrupt the status quo, whether you agree or disagree. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1599.3s)]

*  to their original missions, not political, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1644.36s)]

*  Now, as conservatives, we deeply believe in these principles [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1661.4s)]

*  Joe and Jill Biden seem very happy to see Donald Trump. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1769.76s)]

*  at a Veterans Day event, as you can see right there. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1788.24s)]
*  Make no mistake, it is a new era in the Washington swamp, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1791.52s)]
*  and I hope it's true that Trump will have a new ally [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=1796.04s)]

*  to shape this government into his own personal fiefdom. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2223.68s)]

*  which was under attack from within, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2288.0s)]

*  Identity politics did three things to the military. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2292.0s)]
*  It undermined meritocracy, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2295.0s)]
*  the necessary ingredient for commanding a lethal force. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2297.0s)]
*  It splintered the fighting forces [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2300.0s)]
*  into competing self-interests [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2302.0s)]
*  and it put targets on troops who resisted, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2304.0s)]
*  branding them as extremists who warranted investigation. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2307.16s)]

*  Who is this guy, they mutter? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2315.16s)]
*  Well, he's a two-time Bronze Star winner. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2317.16s)]
*  I've got three. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2319.16s)]

*  to update their resumes. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2330.16s)]
*  Trump just announced that Elon and Vivek [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2332.16s)]
*  will be heading a new commission [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2334.16s)]
*  known as the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  So that vast sucking sound you hear [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2339.3199999999997s)]
*  is the sound of the swamp finally being drained. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2342.3199999999997s)]
*  It's either that or I just ate Indian food. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2345.3199999999997s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  So how bad will it be? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2351.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, when Musk took over Twitter, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2353.3199999999997s)]
*  he reportedly fired 80% of his personnel [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  inside the first month. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2357.3199999999997s)]
*  Which explains why on the way to work this morning [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  I saw Mayor Pete pumping gas at a Sunoco station. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2361.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, if you think that firing 80% [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  of the federal workforce is going too far, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  you might be right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2370.3199999999997s)]
*  It takes 15 workers each day [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2372.3199999999997s)]
*  just to fasten Jerry Nadler's pants. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  I know, it's worth it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  But America's debt is $35 trillion. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a 35 with 12 zeros. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2387.3199999999997s)]
*  That's as many zeros as Kat's dating history. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2390.3199999999997s)]
*  We've got one shot here to save [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2393.48s)]
*  what has been the greatest experiment [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2395.48s)]
*  in government and human freedom of all time. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2397.48s)]
*  And I get the feeling we're about to see more changes [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2400.48s)]
*  in a single administration [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2403.48s)]
*  than we've seen in Pelosi's face. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2405.48s)]
*  And this time it's going to be stuff [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2410.48s)]
*  that people actually want and need [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2412.48s)]
*  and actually voted for. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2414.48s)]
*  No wonder it's going to be carried out [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2415.48s)]
*  by people from a cable news network [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2417.48s)]
*  that people actually love. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2419.48s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2422.64s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2424.64s)]
*  She once co-hosted The View [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2426.64s)]
*  and still can't get the smell off her shoe. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2428.64s)]
*  Host of the Michelle Tafoya podcast, Michelle Tafoya. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2431.64s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2434.64s)]
*  Even RFK Jr. is like, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2437.64s)]
*  what's the deal with his voice? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2439.64s)]
*  Comedian Jim Florentine. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2441.64s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2443.64s)]
*  She wants to have more babies [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2445.64s)]
*  and then cure her rabies. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2447.64s)]
*  New York Times bestseller, The View. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2449.64s)]
*  Here's New York Times bestselling author [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2451.7999999999997s)]

*  And he holds his pants up with Orion's belt. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian and former Andy [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2460.7999999999997s)]
*  Roy, will you check these out? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2462.64s)]
*  So, Michelle, I can't get the smile off my face. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2468.64s)]
*  It's already, you know, it's Wednesday. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2471.64s)]
*  I still feel great. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2473.64s)]
*  With all these new faces, what do you think we're, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2475.64s)]
*  what are you expecting? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2477.64s)]
*  There's something in business called [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2479.64s)]
*  innovative disruption. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2481.64s)]
*  And so people got really excited [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2483.64s)]
*  and bold and started, I'm a disruptor. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2485.64s)]
*  I'm a disruptor. I'm gonna go [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2487.64s)]
*  take this business down, disrupt and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2489.64s)]
*  rebuild. But they don't [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2491.64s)]
*  like it when it's happening [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2493.64s)]
*  to government that they think they can [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2495.64s)]
*  predict, that they've been [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2497.64s)]
*  in control of for all of this time. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2499.64s)]
*  So they don't like this innovative disruption stuff. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2501.64s)]
*  This is weird. This is beautiful. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2503.64s)]
*  Man, this is beautiful. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2505.64s)]
*  Here's two parts. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2507.64s)]
*  The Pete Hegseth thing reminds me, sorry [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2509.64s)]
*  I gotta go to the NFL here, but I'm gonna [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2511.64s)]
*  go with the Niners so you can probably relate. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2513.64s)]
*  When the San Francisco 49ers [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2515.64s)]
*  hired GM John Lynch [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2517.64s)]
*  out of the broadcast booth, he was [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2519.64s)]
*  Fox Sports, the NFL people were going, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2521.64s)]
*  he has no [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2523.64s)]
*  front office experience? What are they doing? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2525.64s)]
*  Well, he's gone on to make the 49ers [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2527.64s)]
*  back into the juggernaut they once were, right? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2529.64s)]
*  So they forgot that he also had [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2531.64s)]
*  a Hall of Fame playing career. That's kind of like [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2533.64s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2535.64s)]
*  They're saying, he's a host, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2537.64s)]
*  he's a news host from Fox. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2539.64s)]
*  What about the Bronze Stars [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2541.64s)]
*  and the Princeton and the Harvard [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2543.64s)]
*  and all the other stuff that Pete Hegseth has [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2545.64s)]
*  done? And yet he is young. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2547.64s)]
*  And yes, thank you. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2549.64s)]
*  He's gonna clean things up and get this DEI [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2551.64s)]
*  crap out of there. As for Elon and [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2553.64s)]
*  Vivek, I cannot wait [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2555.64s)]
*  to watch this. That DOGE, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2557.64s)]
*  they already have a Twitter feed, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2559.64s)]
*  and I've been watching it all day, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2561.64s)]
*  and the followers just keep going up [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2563.64s)]
*  and up. They're up to about 500,000 [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2565.64s)]
*  right now, and they just started [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2567.64s)]
*  this page. People are excited about [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2569.64s)]
*  this stuff. Yeah, it's definitely great. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2571.64s)]
*  I do, I actually, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2573.64s)]
*  I have to make [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2575.64s)]
*  a correction. I said I had three [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2577.64s)]
*  Bronze Stars. I do have them, but only in the [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2579.64s)]
*  summertime when I wear those stickers. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2581.64s)]
*  Jim, you've [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2585.64s)]
*  been fired a bunch of times, right? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2587.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So how do you feel [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2589.64s)]
*  about this efficiency consortium [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2591.64s)]
*  coming on and just getting rid of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2593.64s)]
*  the fat? It's ironic [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2595.64s)]
*  that they have two people when they're trying [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2597.64s)]
*  to be efficient with the government. You probably only [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2599.64s)]
*  need one for that role. Yes, that's true. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2601.64s)]
*  No, I think it's gonna be great. And then, you know, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2603.64s)]
*  then they're crying about Pete. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2605.64s)]
*  They're like, oh, you know, Trump's only picking [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2607.64s)]
*  the people he likes and that are loyal to him. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2609.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you do. Yes. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2611.64s)]
*  You don't pick your mortal enemies. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2613.64s)]
*  I don't remember anyone in [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2615.64s)]
*  the Biden cabinet walking around with a Let's Go [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2617.64s)]
*  Branded shirt on. Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2619.64s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2621.64s)]
*  It's like, he's a loyalist. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2623.64s)]
*  Well, that's how it works. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2625.64s)]
*  Especially with Trump. Trump just got [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2627.64s)]
*  shot at and almost assassinated [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2629.64s)]
*  twice. I think he deserves [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2631.64s)]
*  loyalists around him. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2633.64s)]
*  Yeah. You know? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2635.64s)]
*  It was a good point. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2639.64s)]
*  I'm really happy for Pete. Pete used to [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2641.64s)]
*  live in my neighborhood and my son would play flag [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2643.64s)]
*  football with his son. And when Pete would show [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2645.64s)]
*  up to the game, all, none [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2647.64s)]
*  of the moms watched the flag football. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2649.64s)]
*  They were just staring at him. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2651.64s)]
*  It was like a movie star came. Yeah. I'd even [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2653.64s)]
*  stop, I'd even start staring at him. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2655.64s)]
*  I couldn't help it. It's really dangerous. Women can get [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2657.64s)]
*  pregnant just by staring at him. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2659.64s)]
*  Ooh. Cat. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2661.64s)]
*  I'm not making any inferences. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2665.64s)]
*  Hey, you know, to take a Fox News host, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2667.64s)]
*  so maybe they can make you the ambassador [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2669.64s)]
*  like Terce and Caico so you can do the show right on [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2671.64s)]
*  the beach. I would like to be the [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2673.64s)]
*  ambassador to the Vatican. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2675.64s)]
*  You know, you keep making these [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2677.64s)]
*  jokes, you're going to have a job. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2679.64s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2681.64s)]
*  Yeah, they can't. We're [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2683.64s)]
*  safe here, I think. Cat, what do you make of all [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2685.64s)]
*  this? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2687.64s)]
*  Are you going to miss Pete? Yeah, well Pete's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2689.64s)]
*  a friend, right? And so [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2691.64s)]
*  I definitely will miss Pete, but I think [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2693.64s)]
*  I really enjoyed [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2695.64s)]
*  reading that Politico article about [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2697.64s)]
*  how horrible it was that Trump [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2699.64s)]
*  picked Pete just because [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2701.64s)]
*  of the people that they quoted in that article. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2703.64s)]
*  They quoted, you know, a defense [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2705.64s)]
*  industry lobbyist. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2707.64s)]
*  They quoted the senior [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2709.64s)]
*  or the top policy official in the [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2711.64s)]
*  Pentagon during the Bush administration. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2713.64s)]
*  Like, oh, if that guy thinks [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2715.64s)]
*  it's a bad idea. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2717.64s)]
*  He's worried Pete's not going to try hard enough to find those [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2719.64s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2721.64s)]
*  People [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2723.64s)]
*  don't, I mean, God forbid [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2725.64s)]
*  they have somebody, and then Elizabeth Warren, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2727.64s)]
*  right, she tweets about him, oh, a Fox [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2729.64s)]
*  and Friends weekend host doesn't mention [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2731.64s)]
*  that he's a veteran, let alone that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2733.64s)]
*  he has decades of combat [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2735.64s)]
*  experience, multiple decades [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2737.64s)]
*  of combat experience. I mean, God forbid [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2739.64s)]
*  you put someone in that role that has [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2741.64s)]
*  experience fighting the wars [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2743.64s)]
*  instead of making money off of the wars. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2745.64s)]
*  I mean, the people [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2747.64s)]
*  that's not an argument for [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2749.64s)]
*  why I think it's a bad idea. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2751.64s)]
*  It's funny, if Liz had [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2753.64s)]
*  any of that combat experience, she [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2755.64s)]
*  would have it on her resume like she was an Indian. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2757.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2759.64s)]
*  And she deliberately admits his. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2761.64s)]
*  Listen, nobody is more [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2763.64s)]
*  afraid when Liz Warren starts beating the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2765.64s)]
*  war drum. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2767.64s)]
*  I think [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2769.64s)]
*  we have to consider [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2771.64s)]
*  the sources, okay? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2773.64s)]
*  This is the same group that [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2775.64s)]
*  talked about this super tight [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2777.64s)]
*  election that was looking really good [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2779.64s)]
*  and, you know, they were so excited [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2781.64s)]
*  it was going to go their way, and [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2783.64s)]
*  boy. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2785.64s)]
*  Boy. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2787.64s)]
*  Wrong is not even the right term. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2789.64s)]
*  They're so wrong that CNN [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2791.64s)]
*  and MSNBC are like, hey, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2793.64s)]
*  maybe we should just go back to the news. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2795.64s)]
*  Because this DNC [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2797.64s)]
*  sucks. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2799.64s)]
*  Everything about them through this whole [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2801.64s)]
*  process is as bad as [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2803.64s)]
*  Kamala's budgeting her [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2805.64s)]
*  can. How do you go 20 million over when you [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2807.64s)]
*  got a billion? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2809.64s)]
*  And that was going to balance [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2811.64s)]
*  the budget? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2813.64s)]
*  Pete [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2817.64s)]
*  is boots on the ground. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2819.64s)]
*  Pete knows he still [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2821.64s)]
*  talks to his buddies he served with on a regular [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2823.64s)]
*  basis. Pete knows the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2825.64s)]
*  struggle that veterans go through. Pete knows how this [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2827.64s)]
*  works. He knows the fake [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2829.64s)]
*  and they should be afraid of a person [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2831.64s)]
*  like Pete. They should be afraid of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2833.64s)]
*  Vivek because all of these guys [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2835.64s)]
*  don't need the job. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2837.64s)]
*  See, that's the same thing with President [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2839.64s)]
*  Trump that bothered him. That's what started the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2841.64s)]
*  swamp and the crazy narratives [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2843.64s)]
*  is that they will have no allegiance [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2845.64s)]
*  to them. Pete [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2847.64s)]
*  is going to take a pay cut. Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2849.64s)]
*  Trust me. I was all, hey, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2851.64s)]
*  listen, I was all about press secretary until I [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2853.64s)]
*  saw the pay. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2855.64s)]
*  I can do that. I can do that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2857.64s)]
*  from right here. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2859.64s)]
*  I put a little [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2861.64s)]
*  booth. We do a little segment. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2863.64s)]
*  Honorary. Honorary. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2865.64s)]
*  Because of the pay. But because they [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2867.64s)]
*  don't need it, that's the biggest [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2869.64s)]
*  fear of it. There's going to be a lot of [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2871.64s)]
*  hearings and we're going to stop seeing [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2873.64s)]
*  the thing where they have to pay groups [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2875.64s)]
*  of senators and [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2877.64s)]
*  congressmen to make committees [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2879.64s)]
*  to discuss the idea of finding [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2881.64s)]
*  ideas to fix things. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2883.64s)]
*  We're going to cut all that s*** out so [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2885.64s)]
*  it's either going to be put up or get out [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2887.64s)]
*  and hopefully, like I said, with the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2889.64s)]
*  sizable amount that he's on the [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2891.64s)]
*  Senate, this should be a great time for term [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2893.64s)]
*  limits so you'll have more people like Elon [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2895.64s)]
*  and Pete, the people [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2897.64s)]
*  that don't need the job other than just want [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2899.64s)]
*  to get a service and aren't trying to pick up a couple [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2901.64s)]
*  bucks while they're there. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2903.64s)]
*  And also Tulsi, who was just on [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2905.64s)]
*  two days ago, which he wouldn't tell me [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2907.64s)]
*  but I knew it. I knew it, Tulsi! [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eravxxz9fQo&t=2909.64s)]
