# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 7, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA)
*  It's getting spooky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=2.46s)]
*  That's from Politico. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=5.86s)]
*  Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=7.54s)]
*  They're worried she's running the same Play It Safe campaign, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=11.34s)]
*  up to this point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=14.82s)]
*  She's had about the same number of events as Hillary. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=15.98s)]
*  And crooked had pneumonia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=18.48s)]
*  Since the DNC, Kamala's spent half of her time in DC, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  a third of it without any public appearances. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=25.1s)]
*  Trump is everywhere. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=28.16s)]
*  Anxious Dems wonder why Harris isn't. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  Kamala's been a ghost. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=32.68s)]
*  And even Vegas is spooked. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=34.4s)]
*  Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=36.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=39.24s)]
*  And CNN is gearing up for a horror show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=40.24s)]
*  What happens if the polls are slightly off? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=43.74s)]
*  Remember, back in 2020, the polls [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  underestimated Donald Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=48.24s)]
*  So what happens if we have a similar error [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=50.08s)]
*  across those key battleground states? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=52.24s)]
*  Well, if that happens again, look at this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=54.2s)]
*  Donald Trump carries all of these Great Lake battleground [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  states. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  He carries Nevada as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=59.82s)]
*  Of course, he carries Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=61.78s)]
*  And he gets to get this, 312 electoral votes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=64.5s)]
*  So the bottom line is, if we have an error [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=67.94s)]
*  like we did four years ago, Donald Trump [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=69.56s)]
*  is going to win this election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=71.38s)]
*  Kamala Harris is going to lose. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=72.42s)]
*  Joy turning into dread. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=74.14s)]
*  Even Saturday night feels it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=76.58s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=78.18s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=81.58s)]
*  He's out there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=82.18s)]
*  He's doing his thing, whatever that may be. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=82.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=87.06s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=88.06s)]
*  Just relax. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=88.62s)]
*  You know, you haven't had a night off in three months. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=89.42s)]
*  Do you want to watch something less stressful, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=91.74s)]
*  like the Menendez Brothers show? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=93.54s)]
*  I don't know, Dougie. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=96.38s)]
*  I kind of wish I had picked Josh right now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=97.22s)]
*  Oh, Josh Shapiro? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=99.58s)]
*  No, Josh. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Cabernet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=102.3s)]
*  Look, Tim will be fine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  It's not like he's going to say something crazy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=105.94s)]
*  I've become friends with school shooters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Obama world doesn't find it funny. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=111.84s)]
*  Remember, Kamala was his idea. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=114.3s)]
*  David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=116.6s)]
*  It's only the most difficult oral exam in the planet [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=119.32s)]
*  for the most difficult job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=122.72s)]
*  So Obama's ordering Harris to do more interviews. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=124.72s)]
*  And the last time a Democrat didn't listen to Obama, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=128.04s)]
*  they got cooed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=130.84s)]
*  So Harris began a media blitz this week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=132.24s)]
*  This is how 60 Minutes went. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=135.04s)]
*  It seems that the president's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=137.48s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, Bill, the work that we have done [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=141.66s)]
*  has resulted in a number of movements [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=145.86s)]
*  in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=150.86s)]
*  or a result of many things, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=156.86s)]
*  including our advocacy for what needs to happen [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=159.7s)]
*  in the region. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=162.7s)]
*  I don't know what she just said there, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=164.58s)]
*  but I think that's a very good point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=166.02s)]
*  I don't know what she just said there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=167.66s)]
*  Even 60 Minutes told her she's not living in the real world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=169.74s)]
*  My plan is about saying that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=174.02s)]
*  when you invest in small businesses, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=178.3s)]
*  you invest in the middle class [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=180.84s)]
*  and you strengthen America's economy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=183.26s)]
*  Small businesses are part of the backbone [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=185.1s)]
*  of America's economy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=187.22s)]
*  Pardon me, Madam Vice President. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=188.78s)]
*  The question was, how are you going to pay for it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=190.82s)]
*  Well, one of the things is I'm gonna make sure [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  that the richest among us who can afford it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=197.14s)]
*  pay their fair share in taxes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=200.7s)]
*  But we're dealing with the real world here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  But the real world includes- [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=205.26s)]
*  How are you gonna get this through Congress? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=206.66s)]
*  You know, when you talk quietly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  with a lot of folks in Congress, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=211.05999999999997s)]
*  they know exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=212.5s)]
*  No one knows what she's talking about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=214.66s)]
*  Does Kamala even know what she's talking about? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=216.66s)]
*  She was on the Call Her Daddy podcast [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=219.54s)]
*  and she doesn't even understand her own plans. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  Another thing that I'm really focused on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  is small businesses and startups [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=227.06s)]
*  and giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=229.54s)]
*  because right now it's $5,000 [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=232.98s)]
*  and you can't start up anything, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=234.9s)]
*  any small business with $5,000. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=236.1s)]
*  Does Kamala not know what a tax deduction is? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=238.5s)]
*  She thinks she's giving small business startups 50 grand. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=241.66s)]
*  She doesn't know the difference [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=245.7s)]
*  between a tax deduction and a handout. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=246.82s)]
*  Kamala's also never heard of the draft. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=249.78s)]
*  I wanna pose this question more to you and the daddy gang, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=253.22s)]
*  but one of the biggest conversations in this year's election [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=256.22s)]
*  revolves around a woman's body. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=260.3s)]
*  I wanna take a moment and can we try to think of any law [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=263.5s)]
*  that gives the government the power to make a decision- [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=270.62s)]
*  I know what you're gonna ask. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=274.54s)]
*  About a man's body. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=276.3s)]
*  Let's do this. No. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=279.54s)]
*  Is there any law? No. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=282.62s)]
*  No. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=285.1s)]
*  It's, no. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=287.22s)]
*  Besides the draft, maybe VAX mandates. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=289.3s)]
*  Even Andrea Mitchell admits people are realizing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=294.66s)]
*  she's a lightweight. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=297.38s)]
*  I think they've gotta double down on doing more interviews [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=299.42s)]
*  and serious interviews. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  She's got such a big problem with men. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=303.38s)]
*  I think there's an under account of the Trump vote. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  I think there's misogynation in all of this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=306.94s)]
*  Black and white men, big problem, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=310.94s)]
*  but also the business world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  They don't think she is serious. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=315.78s)]
*  They don't think she's a heavyweight. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  Kamala's doing Colbert tomorrow, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=319.18s)]
*  a guy who held a fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=320.98s)]
*  Then she's doing The View, another love fest, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=324.38s)]
*  and then Howard Stern, the last Democrat nominee [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=327.86s)]
*  who went on Stern dropped out. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=331.02s)]
*  These are all safe spaces that make her look like [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=333.74s)]
*  she's getting out there, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=336.14s)]
*  but she's just hiding in plain sight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  We're in two proxy wars, the border's wide open, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  the border's a little bit of a time-primer high, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=343.18s)]
*  and she's doing frivolous sit-downs with friends. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=345.46s)]
*  NBC says most of these sit-downs are just for the vibes, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=348.94s)]
*  but the vibes are scary. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=352.74s)]
*  The Democrat party's being haunted by Hillary's ghost, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=354.78s)]
*  and Kamala keeps seeing Biden's. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  Joe won't stop big-footing her [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=361.06s)]
*  and bragging about how close they were. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=362.82s)]
*  President Biden just keeps tying her to his administration. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  That was a surprise to the Harris campaign. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  They found out just a few minutes before [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  that the president would be doing that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=376.5s)]
*  A lot of Harris aides did not find that to be helpful. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=377.98s)]
*  They do not want Joe Biden to be popping up in that way. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=380.66s)]
*  They also don't love the idea of him reminding people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=383.38s)]
*  of their strong connection. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=387.1s)]
*  How dare the Biden tie Harris [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=388.98s)]
*  to the Biden-Harris administration? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=392.42s)]
*  Doesn't he know how unpopular they are? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=394.94s)]
*  It's like Kamala inherited all of his money [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  and now wants nothing to do with him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=399.74s)]
*  But Biden keeps haunting her from his grave. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=402.06s)]
*  He's insisting on campaigning for her [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=404.3s)]
*  in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=407.14s)]
*  And the Harris campaign is like, you know, Joe, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  you don't really have to do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=411.38s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=413.06s)]
*  And Biden says, no, no, no, it's my pleasure. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=414.3s)]
*  And after I campaign for you and remind everybody [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=416.66s)]
*  how you co-signed my agenda, I'm going to Africa. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=419.3s)]
*  Joe Biden in Africa is going to attract a lot of attention. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=423.62s)]
*  Biden stumbling across the Serengeti [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=428.74s)]
*  maybe isn't the kind of thing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=431.14s)]
*  the Harris campaign is looking forward to. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=432.58s)]
*  Biden on an African safari while the Southeast is under water, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=435.38s)]
*  drowning in hurricanes, no good. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=440.53999999999996s)]
*  A month before the election, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=443.34s)]
*  Harris is trying to erase herself [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=445.18s)]
*  from the Biden-Harris administration [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=446.98s)]
*  and completely change her media strategy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=449.34s)]
*  Now, ask any political professional [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=451.94s)]
*  if pulling a 180 in the final stretch is a good tactic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=454.34s)]
*  That's not what you do when you're ahead. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=458.58s)]
*  That's what you do when you're down [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=460.7s)]
*  and you're scrambling for something that sticks. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity and a busy news night. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=465.65999999999997s)]

*  Unlike Kamala and Joe, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=483.06s)]
*  they actually stage 30,000 utility vehicles [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  and water and food and medicine and supplies, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=489.26s)]
*  something that Kamala and Joe can learn from. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=492.18s)]
*  And tonight, Governor DeSantis will respond to Kamala Harris [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  politicizing this hurricane. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=498.06s)]

*  struggling to recover in North Carolina 11 days after. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=507.1s)]
*  We're gonna check in with those victims. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=511.86s)]
*  They do have a message for Kamala and Joe, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=513.34s)]
*  that's straight ahead tonight. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=515.7s)]
*  And also tonight, 97 hostages, including four Americans [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  remain somewhere in Gaza. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=521.9s)]
*  One year after the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=524.26s)]
*  it's now a forefront war against Israel. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=528.02s)]
*  1200 people brutally murdered by Hamas, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=530.86s)]
*  others raped and kidnapped and tortured and beheaded. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=533.82s)]

*  adjusted for population. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  What happened one year ago today, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=541.78s)]
*  that is the equivalent of 40,000 Americans [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  killed in a single day. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=545.9s)]
*  Will somebody tell Joe and Kamala? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=547.8199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, but during one of her famous word salads, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=550.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris couldn't bring herself to even back. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=552.54s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=555.98s)]
*  the only democracy in the region, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=557.54s)]
*  our biggest ally in the region, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=559.38s)]
*  and his war against radical Islamic terrorists [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=561.3399999999999s)]
*  that are still holding Americans hostage. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=564.18s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=567.38s)]
*  Do we have a real close ally [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=569.34s)]
*  in Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=573.78s)]
*  I think with all due respect, the better question is, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=577.5s)]
*  do we have an important alliance [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=580.54s)]
*  between the American people and the Israeli people? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=582.62s)]
*  And the answer to that question is yes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=586.9s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately, we'll have much more of Kamala's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=590.26s)]
*  disastrous CBS interview straight ahead. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=592.34s)]
*  And get this, after weeks and weeks and 70 plus days [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=594.46s)]
*  of hiding from even her closest friends [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=599.1800000000001s)]
*  in the state-run media mob, Kamala Harris, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=600.74s)]
*  now all of a sudden is gonna participate [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=603.1s)]
*  in a number of interviews this week. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=605.34s)]
*  They're all really hard-hitting. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=606.7800000000001s)]
*  Now, every one of these, well, they'll be infomercials. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=609.26s)]
*  Friendly interviews, let's see, CBS, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=612.62s)]
*  oh, the ladies of the view, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=615.14s)]
*  the sadly, newly, extremely woke Howard Stern, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  the guy that now thinks that every Trump supporter is stupid. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=621.7800000000001s)]
*  The only thing that would make you stupid [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=624.7s)]
*  is if you were a Howard Stern fan [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=626.5s)]
*  and you still listen to him at this point. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=629.46s)]
*  If he thinks you're stupid, why would you listen to him? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=631.54s)]
*  And a podcast named Call Her Daddy, that's a big one. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=633.94s)]
*  And Stephen Colbert, who loves to kiss her ass. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=637.94s)]
*  Now, take a look at your screen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=641.78s)]
*  These outlets are never gonna ask, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=642.94s)]
*  any of these people will never ask the questions [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=644.74s)]
*  about her radical, extreme, and frankly dangerous record [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=647.46s)]
*  and her failures in office. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=650.98s)]
*  There will be no real vetting of Kamala, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=652.74s)]
*  no real questions in any of these appearances, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=654.7s)]
*  none whatsoever. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  I hate Donald Trump, I hate Donald Trump more. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=659.6600000000001s)]
*  Do you hate Donald Trump? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=661.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hate Donald Trump. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=662.74s)]
*  Do you hate Donald Trump? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=663.58s)]
*  That's what the interviews will be. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  Make no mistake, there is one huge reason [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=665.98s)]
*  and only one reason that Kamala is now going on [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=669.46s)]
*  and doing any interviews. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=672.82s)]
*  Her internal poll numbers have gotta be horrendous. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=674.6600000000001s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=678.26s)]
*  from the most credible pollsters in 2016 and 2020 [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=681.5s)]
*  in swing states, we've been showing you, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=685.58s)]
*  they're not great for Kamala Harris. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=687.82s)]
*  She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=690.02s)]
*  Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=694.94s)]
*  North Carolina, and Georgia. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=696.98s)]
*  The race is even tight in Virginia, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=699.1800000000001s)]
*  where Kamala holds a slight lead. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=701.34s)]

*  What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr. President? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=852.78s)]
*  What do the states in the storm zone, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=855.94s)]

*  Oh, in the storm zone? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=861.5s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=862.66s)]
*  I'm wondering what storm they're talking about. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=863.7s)]
*  They're getting everything they need, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=867.14s)]
*  and they're very happy across the board. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=869.02s)]
*  They're getting everything they need. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=873.02s)]
*  They're very happy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=875.58s)]
*  Federal rescue operations have been slow. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=877.22s)]
*  They have been disjointed, nearly nonexistent. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=879.62s)]
*  According to Biden's DHS secretary, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=882.22s)]
*  FEMA, he's saying, is out of money [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=884.46s)]
*  after the Emergency Management Agency [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=886.62s)]
*  spent a billion of your dollars [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=889.6600000000001s)]
*  to feed and house Harris-Biden [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=891.94s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=895.38s)]
*  Borders are Kamala Harris all on board for that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=897.62s)]
*  And meanwhile, the top two stated priorities of FEMA [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=900.6600000000001s)]
*  are diversity, equity and inclusion, and climate change. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=904.14s)]
*  Okay, I think their priorities are screwed up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=908.0600000000001s)]
*  You would think that the emergency management [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=910.98s)]
*  would be the top of the list [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=913.26s)]
*  and helping every American in need. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=915.1800000000001s)]
*  You'd think they would have the money available, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  especially in light of how much money [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=919.22s)]
*  they give all these other countries, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=920.74s)]
*  but not under Kamala's so-called leadership. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=922.58s)]
*  And today, Kamala was most focused [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=925.02s)]
*  on trashing Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=927.34s)]
*  for daring to criticize the administration's response. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=929.78s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=932.9s)]
*  The other point I'd make is that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=933.98s)]
*  there's a lot of misinformation being pushed out there [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=935.66s)]
*  by the former president about what is available, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=939.62s)]
*  in particular to the survivors of the lean. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=942.98s)]
*  And first of all, it's extraordinarily irresponsible. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=946.46s)]
*  It's about him, it's not about you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=949.74s)]
*  And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=952.46s)]
*  that are available to folks who desperately need them. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=956.14s)]
*  Kamala, you've been MIA, Joe's been MIA. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  You're lying and saying everybody's fine, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=964.46s)]
*  everybody's been taken care of and everybody's happy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=966.7s)]
*  Mallorca says you're bankrupt. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=970.5s)]
*  FEMA's website said you gave a billion [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=972.26s)]
*  to your illegal immigrants. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=974.5s)]
*  You're not doing your job by going on the, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=976.3s)]
*  you know, call me daddy website. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=978.86s)]
*  Only about $4 million, that's it, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=980.78s)]
*  was dispensed from FEMA and it took them a week to show up. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  Thousands upon thousands of Americans [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=987.98s)]
*  have lost absolutely everything. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=990.02s)]
*  They're using horses and mules, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=992.9s)]
*  but not helicopters and government planes [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=995.5s)]
*  and the entire town's washed away, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=998.98s)]
*  roads, highways, bridges. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1001.22s)]
*  They are closed indefinitely. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1003.22s)]
*  Power, clean drinking water, still in short supply. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  The level of suffering has been immense [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1008.82s)]
*  and you have done nothing. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1011.46s)]
*  And here is what Kamala was posting on X two days ago. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1013.1800000000001s)]
*  Look at this, quote, the people of Lebanon [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1016.1s)]
*  are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  I am concerned about the security and well-being [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1022.58s)]
*  of civilians suffering in Lebanon [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1026.22s)]

*  to Lebanon over last year, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1051.18s)]

*  that the act of swallowing is actually [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1393.94s)]
*  helpful to your health. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1395.9s)]
*  See, I told you, said one man. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1397.9s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1400.18s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1401.02s)]
*  Slow. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1401.8600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1402.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1403.5400000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1404.38s)]
*  So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, PA, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1409.14s)]
*  where roughly three months ago, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1411.9s)]
*  he was almost assassinated by a loser [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1413.46s)]
*  who couldn't make his high school rifle club, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1415.9s)]
*  but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1417.98s)]
*  It was huge, so huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1421.5800000000002s)]
*  First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1425.38s)]
*  and then it opens with this. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1428.2600000000002s)]
*  We love Pennsylvania, and as I was saying... [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1430.5s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1434.8600000000001s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1435.7s)]

*  Ha ha ha. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1446.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1447.46s)]
*  I love that chart. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1448.5400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1450.2600000000002s)]
*  Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1451.94s)]
*  Elon Musk showed up jumping around [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1459.22s)]
*  All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1461.94s)]
*  or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1464.22s)]
*  Crowd was even bigger this time around, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1467.14s)]
*  and it's solemn, it was funny, and dare I say, joyous. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1469.26s)]
*  Now compare that to the existential prophecies [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1472.7800000000002s)]
*  of a future Trump presidency. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1475.5400000000002s)]
*  A threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1478.0600000000002s)]
*  Was there anything in Butler resembling that? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1482.66s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people from all over [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1485.22s)]
*  standing together to hear speeches [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1487.1s)]
*  that painted America as a place worth protecting, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1489.1s)]
*  where safety matters, where borders matter, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1492.02s)]
*  where American jobs matter, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1494.54s)]
*  where our leaders would actually put our country first. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1496.34s)]
*  All things that a Harris presidency [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1499.5s)]
*  would make disappear faster than an erection [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1501.7s)]
*  on Bikini Day at The View. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh! [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1506.3s)]
*  Oh! [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1507.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh! [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1507.98s)]

*  Oh! [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1509.66s)]
*  Oh! [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1510.5s)]
*  That's a theme here. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1511.34s)]
*  That sentence started out so well. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1512.54s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1516.74s)]
*  the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1518.6999999999998s)]
*  people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1521.86s)]
*  by the way. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1524.34s)]
*  Who do you think though our media is gonna blame [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1525.6599999999999s)]
*  if Trump wins this thing? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1527.86s)]
*  Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1530.02s)]
*  violent retribution if Trump wins. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1532.54s)]
*  This is an increasingly desperate person [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1535.58s)]
*  who's preparing for civil war. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1540.1s)]
*  People right now in the Republican party [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1542.1399999999999s)]
*  are in fact actively rooting for [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1545.58s)]
*  and inciting a split, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1549.5s)]
*  you know, a division in the country. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1554.1s)]
*  What he says he intends to do, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1556.5s)]
*  and when he turns around and says he intends to use [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1558.82s)]
*  SEAL Team Six or the military, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1562.1799999999998s)]
*  within which to round up his critics or his opponents, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1564.62s)]
*  he intends to do it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1568.3s)]
*  He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1570.54s)]
*  and to create enough tension and confusion [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1573.26s)]
*  that you'll have people on the streets [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1575.78s)]
*  protecting and defending him. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1577.86s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1579.58s)]
*  So you get the sense there's gonna be chaos if Trump wins. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1581.18s)]
*  That's the sense they want you to have. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1584.86s)]
*  It's less an election and more of an extortion. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1587.74s)]
*  And sadly, they may be right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1590.74s)]
*  There will be chaos if Trump wins [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1592.38s)]
*  because it'll come from them. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1594.54s)]
*  What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1596.38s)]
*  Your blood. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1599.3s)]
*  It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1600.78s)]
*  It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1603.74s)]
*  At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1606.82s)]
*  Democratfellas look like this. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1609.98s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1613.22s)]
*  Has Kamala Harris articulated [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1616.5s)]
*  his single original policy point? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1618.06s)]
*  Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1619.8999999999999s)]
*  which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1621.78s)]
*  during a smash and grab. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1624.62s)]
*  She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1627.06s)]
*  Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1629.94s)]
*  from her own administration, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1633.3799999999999s)]
*  it's always followed by or else. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1635.34s)]
*  Or else disaster, chaos. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1638.26s)]
*  A chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1640.5s)]
*  We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1643.06s)]
*  San Fran, and Minneapolis. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1645.26s)]
*  Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1647.86s)]
*  He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1649.58s)]
*  Now, some of us might be a bit scared, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1654.1000000000001s)]
*  but that's what they want. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1656.22s)]
*  But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1657.9s)]
*  into a Democrat win, because clearly this is their last [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1660.26s)]
*  sure sign of desperation. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1663.1000000000001s)]
*  From a side that doesn't have policy or history [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1665.18s)]
*  or even common sense on their side, only threats. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1667.66s)]
*  But the good news? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1671.0600000000002s)]
*  Like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1672.38s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1675.98s)]
*  in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1678.98s)]
*  in it showed him that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1682.38s)]
*  Trump came back like he promised. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1684.74s)]
*  He didn't let them set the limits. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1686.38s)]
*  They took their best shot, literally, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1688.38s)]
*  then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1689.98s)]
*  Like Brian Stelter returning to steal from the CNN fridge. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1692.94s)]
*  Trump showed up saying, forget it, the threats won't stop us. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1697.94s)]
*  So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1701.3400000000001s)]
*  By gathering all those people in the same field [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1704.54s)]
*  where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1706.98s)]
*  for president, Trump and thousands of others showed [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1710.42s)]
*  that this election can actually be decided on the merits [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1713.1000000000001s)]
*  and not under the threat of the left, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1717.18s)]
*  bowing chaos if they don't get their way. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1719.0200000000002s)]
*  It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccyB24OVcA&t=1721.7s)]
