# Fox News Highlights - May 9th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI)
*  I'm calling this segment Good News Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=0.0s)]
*  The tariffs and Trump's plan to put pressure on China is working. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=4.16s)]
*  Of course, the media is so all in for globalism that they report the good news as bad news. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=8.88s)]
*  We have a new measure of how President Trump's tariffs have impacted the flow of Chinese [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  goods coming into the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=20.42s)]
*  New figures show the volume plummeted last month, plummeted big time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=22.78s)]
*  Already we're seeing ships coming from China, half empty, containers half empty. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=26.94s)]
*  Well, that's just what the president needed to happen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=32.1s)]
*  It was short-term inconvenience for long-term change in our trade and manufacturing posture. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=34.7s)]
*  Is the press really so dug in on hating Trump that they can't see any wisdom in this strategy? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  Now if this dragged on for several months, yeah, it would be tougher politically and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  economically. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=50.42s)]
*  But right now, Trump's approach is the right one. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=51.42s)]
*  And from what I saw at the White House today, they are very bullish on where things are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=55.3s)]
*  headed, especially with the team he has. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=59.66s)]
*  What parameters have you given Scott Besson on negotiating with China this weekend? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=62.3s)]
*  We have to make a great deal for America. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=68.78s)]
*  Are you going to be disappointed if he comes back without a deal? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=70.34s)]
*  No, not at all, because we already made a great deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=74.46s)]
*  We're not doing business with China right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=77.46s)]
*  We lost one trillion dollars last year with China, one trillion. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=79.58s)]
*  So if you're not going to do business with them, you're not going to lose one trillion [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=84.78s)]
*  dollars. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=87.58s)]
*  But we lost... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=88.58s)]
*  I just want China to do great. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=89.58s)]
*  You know, I'm very friendly with President Xi. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=90.94s)]
*  I have great respect for him and for China. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=93.58s)]
*  But we can't continue to allow them to do what they did. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=96.54s)]
*  Consistency, America first. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=100.78s)]
*  How refreshing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=102.42s)]
*  And Trump's optimism is well-founded. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=104.1s)]
*  After all, isn't it better that the United States is starting these talks with China's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=106.94s)]
*  back up against the wall economically? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=111.84s)]
*  Remember, there is no substitution for the U.S. market. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=114.28s)]
*  And thanks to Trump's bold moves with tariffs, we have the leverage no other president dared [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=118.68s)]
*  or cared to use. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=124.54s)]
*  And Trump's exercise of leverage was also evident in the UK deal announced on Thursday [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=126.64s)]
*  that he alluded to in those comments. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  Now imagine if we had a news media that was actually unbiased, let's say even 50 percent [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=133.56s)]
*  of the time covering these stories. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=138.44s)]
*  Because the president estimates that a trade deal with the UK will bring in as much as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=140.68s)]
*  a hundred billion dollars to the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=145.16s)]
*  But of course, it's just dismissed by the usual crowd at CNN. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  This was low-hanging fruit. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=151.72s)]
*  This was, I would say, actually something the Biden administration could have had in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=152.9s)]
*  terms of a trade deal with the UK. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And they just didn't want to for a variety of reasons. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=158.32s)]
*  The UK has been eager for a deal, too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=161.44s)]
*  There is not a trade deficit with the UK. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=163.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=165.56s)]
*  This has a trade surplus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=166.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=167.56s)]
*  And the other countries in question here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=168.56s)]
*  No kidding, Maggie. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=171.32s)]
*  But Trump got billions of dollars for the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=173.36s)]
*  You get it? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=177.0s)]
*  You get why that's a good thing? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=178.0s)]
*  And if Biden could have done it, as she said, why didn't he? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=179.16s)]
*  And more good news. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=182.9s)]
*  After years of seeing native-born Americans get shafted in hiring, we finally have a president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=183.9s)]
*  who's turning things around on that score. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Because the number of employed native-born people has grown for three straight months [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=191.46s)]
*  by over a million last month, April 2025, while the foreign-born number shrank by 400,000. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=196.28s)]
*  Also, as the bar chart illustrates, the number of employed foreign-born workers has dropped [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=202.88s)]
*  in two of the past three months. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=209.6s)]
*  Told you it was Good News Friday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=212.64s)]
*  And welcome to this special Friday night edition of Hannity. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  The left in a state of rage. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, after getting absolutely demolished in the 2024 elections, Democrats, they had [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=221.28s)]
*  two options. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=226.36s)]
*  They could have accepted reality. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=227.4s)]
*  They could have worked with President Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=228.84s)]
*  They could try to find common ground. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  Nope. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=232.36s)]
*  Instead, they woke up on November the 6th, 2024. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=233.36s)]
*  They chose violence and anger and total rage. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  They have been completely unhinged ever since. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=240.36s)]
*  Now, coming up, we're going to bring you the very latest from the pro-Hamas riots that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=243.08s)]
*  are taking place in American's college campuses. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=247.94s)]
*  Also tonight, she's back, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, once again, back in the news for [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=251.62s)]
*  every wrong reason. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=257.18s)]
*  During a congressional hearing, she actually forced a witness to play a game she called, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=258.74s)]
*  quote, Trump or trans. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=263.98s)]
*  I'll explain straight ahead. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=266.94s)]
*  And later, Jimmy Fela will give his thoughts on New York's number one Trump hater, Leticia [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=268.9s)]
*  James, who is now in some potential legal trouble of her own and getting ridiculed by [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=274.6s)]
*  her own constituents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  My question is for Tush James. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  Will you apologize to President Trump for wasting millions of dollars and the state [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=286.6s)]
*  of New York for a witch trial? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=291.22s)]
*  And how does it feel to know that you're, you will be in prison for mortgage fraud? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=294.1s)]
*  We'll check in with Jimmy Fela and also we'll tell you about our upcoming punchlines and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=300.84s)]
*  Patriots tour. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=307.4s)]
*  Tickets on sale today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=308.4s)]
*  We'll tell you about that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=309.96s)]
*  But first here is, and that's along with Fox Nation, a quick review of the current state [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=310.96s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=315.4s)]
*  Hours ago, several congressional Democrats, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, showed up [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  uninvited at an ICE facility and breached the perimeter. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  Apparently they wanted to secure the release of a violent criminal illegal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=326.92s)]
*  One of those gang members detained inside. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=331.4s)]
*  This was supposed to be a bold political stunt in defiance of President Trump, but the Newark [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=333.9s)]
*  mayor ended up getting arrested while the members of Congress were ultimately granted [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  a tour of the facilities. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=343.88s)]
*  Now, according to the U.S. attorney, Alina Habba, quote, the mayor of Newark committed [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=345.36s)]
*  trespass, ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security to remove himself from the ICE detention [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=350.08s)]
*  center in Newark, New Jersey. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=356.44s)]
*  This afternoon, he has willingly chosen to disregard the law that will not stand in this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=358.68s)]
*  state. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=365.12s)]
*  He has been taken into custody. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=366.12s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=367.64s)]
*  Now, this is a truly pathetic party filled with all this anti-Trump rage, desperate for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=369.28s)]
*  attention, taken over by radicals. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=375.24s)]
*  But tonight, this anger isn't just reserved for Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=378.04s)]
*  That's pretty predictable. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=382.22s)]
*  Also, they're even mad at themselves, especially Joe and Jill Biden, that they have now thrust [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  themselves back into the public spotlight. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  But according to reports, the Bidens, they're broke. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=392.0s)]
*  How could they be broke? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, with the family syndicate, anyway, desperately, they need a huge book deal to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=396.88s)]
*  stay afloat. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=401.24s)]
*  So they are going back to the well one more time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=402.24s)]
*  And of course, they go back to the, you know, predictable, trashing Trump while hoping [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  that every American forgets about Joe's horrific track record as president and his full blown [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=410.94s)]
*  cognitive decline. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=416.58s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the Democratic Party's heir apparent, AOC, apparently she's been very, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=417.9s)]
*  very busy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=424.5s)]
*  Fight the oligarchy, flying around on private jets with Grandpa Bernie, talking about and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=426.1s)]
*  preaching about the evils of capitalism and climate change on a private jet. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=431.64s)]
*  And then there's Kamala Harris, who is still clinging on to relevance during a written [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=436.86s)]
*  interview with Vogue magazine. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=441.74s)]
*  Kamala served up yet another word salad, this one in writing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=443.9s)]
*  I mean, no excuse on that one. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=447.9s)]
*  This time about artistic expression and the passage of time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=450.02s)]
*  No, artistic expression and its influence on politics and its ability to, quote, shape [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=453.9s)]
*  the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=459.1s)]
*  And if you need to go where you need to go, you need something to help you to go to where [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=464.46s)]
*  you need to go so you can go and then go home. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  And California Governor Gavin Newsom also working very, very, very hard to stay in the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=472.14s)]
*  limelight trying to say things he has never said or believed in nearly 30 years in the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=476.97999999999996s)]
*  public eye. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  Maybe he can get Elon Musk to give him an AI brain transplant. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  Now he's also now trying to distract from his abject failure as California's governor, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  a brand new website dedicated to fact checking pro-Trump accounts on X. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  And just when you think that the left can't get any more petty and desperate, just think [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=499.06s)]
*  again. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  This morning, our old friend, poor liberal Joe, morning Joe, couldn't find a nice thing [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  to say about Trump's big new trade deal with the UK. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=509.82s)]
*  In fact, they almost seem sad and disappointed that President Trump's trade negotiations [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  are actually paying off, like eight trillion in committed investments from countries and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=520.46s)]
*  companies for the next four years. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=525.5s)]
*  Eight trillion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=527.5s)]
*  All right, take a look. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=528.5s)]
*  Maybe there's a deal in Canada that happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=531.18s)]
*  The same thing with President Scheinbaum in Mexico. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=532.98s)]
*  I think you look for what's most likely most likely those trade deals are going to come [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=536.02s)]
*  from leaders that he's more comfortable with. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  And he certainly, again, says he's very comfortable with Keir Starmer. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=544.42s)]
*  Yeah, no question there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=548.62s)]
*  President Trump diplomacy is very personal. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=549.66s)]
*  I mean, there's the degree of that for most presidents, but this one in particular, it's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=551.78s)]
*  really whether or not he likes you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=555.78s)]
*  This is a relatively low hanging fruit. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=557.26s)]
*  If you can't get a trade deal with the longest standing and loyalist United States ally anywhere [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  in the world over generations, you're going to be in trouble when you're dealing with [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=565.7s)]
*  some of the more obstreperous countries around the world. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=570.78s)]
*  It just is nonstop. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  The state run legacy media mob Democratic Party. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=576.5799999999999s)]
*  They just hate Trump so much. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  They're so addicted to this hate, seemingly rooting for America. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=581.66s)]
*  And that means all of you to fail. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=586.98s)]
*  You don't just hate President Trump. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=589.2199999999999s)]
*  They also hate us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=591.02s)]
*  You, his supporters and even other Democrats don't completely fall in line. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  You know, political differences no longer tolerated inside the Democratic Party. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=597.8199999999999s)]
*  Take a look at how they're currently treating John Fetterman. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  They had no issues with Fetterman on the campaign trail, even though he was recovering from [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=605.42s)]
*  a very serious stroke. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=610.78s)]
*  And by the way, he's done incredibly well. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=612.14s)]
*  And thank God for him. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=614.14s)]
*  And by the way, he was struggling to communicate during that campaign. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=615.8199999999999s)]
*  But now that the senator has broken ranks and he's doing a lot better cognitively, a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=619.8599999999999s)]
*  lot better. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=624.54s)]
*  But God forbid he broke ranks with his party on just really a few issues on the borders, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  on Iran and on Israel. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=632.02s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=634.6999999999999s)]
*  Now the knives are out for John Fetterman. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=635.54s)]
*  One hit piece after another, one attack after another. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=637.62s)]
*  Now Republicans are defending him. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=640.74s)]
*  They don't agree with most of the other issues. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=642.54s)]
*  Tom Cotton remarked, quote, John Fetterman and I have our differences, but he is a decent [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=644.86s)]
*  and genuine guy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=650.02s)]
*  The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he's pro-Israel and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=651.5s)]
*  they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=657.26s)]
*  Now his fellow Pennsylvania senator, Dave McCormick, also coming to Fetterman's defense, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=660.66s)]
*  quote, it is time to put politics aside, stop these vicious personal attacks against Senator [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=666.02s)]
*  Fetterman and his wife and his health. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=672.58s)]
*  While we may have many differences, we are both committed to working together to achieve [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=675.58s)]
*  results for the people of Pennsylvania and make their lives better. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=679.62s)]
*  He is authentic, decent, principled and a fighter. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=683.7s)]
*  These disgraceful smears against him are not the John that I know and respect. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=687.06s)]
*  Sadly, it's so revealing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=691.8199999999999s)]
*  Zero tolerance. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=694.18s)]
*  This is the party of rage. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=696.3s)]
*  The Democratic Party, the party of diversity of thought, no, that party doesn't exist. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=698.4599999999999s)]
*  This is the party of censorship. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=704.14s)]
*  This is the party of big government control. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=705.7399999999999s)]
*  High taxes, regulations, broken promises, bankruptcy, climate change, no paper straws, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=708.18s)]
*  no freedom. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=715.34s)]
*  You can't have your air conditioner, gas stove, washer, dryer. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=717.1s)]
*  However, private jets for elitists that are fighting the oligarchs, that's okay. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=721.14s)]
*  Open borders that allows unknown terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=726.74s)]
*  that's okay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=732.22s)]
*  Forget about the safety and security of the American people and open jails for criminals, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=733.7800000000001s)]
*  lawfare for people like Donald Trump and anyone around him and of course, men playing in women's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  sports. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=744.14s)]
*  The party of compassion, they won't even call or stand up for mothers that lost their children [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=745.18s)]
*  because of their open borders policies or even a young man who beats cancer. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=750.42s)]
*  None of it makes sense, but I guess rage doesn't make sense, does it? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=755.58s)]
*  Until you realize the left wants to upend our entire system, replace it with a one party [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=759.42s)]
*  socialist, statist, state, communism, socialism, whatever you want to call it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=765.74s)]
*  Wound to the tomb, cradle to grave, that's what their goal is. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=772.86s)]
*  Everything else is just a means to the end and the rage rules the day, every day. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=777.34s)]
*  I know! [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=787.42s)]

*  Yeah, all right. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=880.14s)]
*  Or as Elon Musk calls it, Sunday. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=883.66s)]

*  The book will include details from Jill's diary. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=919.42s)]
*  I think we might have a page from it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=923.74s)]
*  So why do the Bidens need all this money? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=933.34s)]
*  Well, according to an inside source, Joe Biden is going broke. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=935.74s)]

*  After all, Joe Biden ran the country and Michelle Obama ran the weight room. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1213.3400000000001s)]
*  Of course, if Doug Emhoff were the First Lady right now, the Times would be writing puff pieces about how he goes out of his way to pay for the staff's abortions. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1219.3400000000001s)]
*  The Times bashed his Melania for only spending 14 days in the White House. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1232.06s)]
*  But can you blame her for not wanting to fully move in until they fumigate Hunter's quarters? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1236.7s)]
*  Here's one of their complaints. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1241.82s)]
*  Quote, Mr. Trump has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a First Lady. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1244.6999999999998s)]
*  She's not the one carefully selecting light fixtures, redesigning the Rose Garden, greeting tour groups or hosting receptions. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1251.82s)]
*  He is. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1258.86s)]
*  So that's an interesting take from a bunch of lefties. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  The First Lady isn't tending to ladylike duties, but the man is. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1263.02s)]
*  You know, it says something about Trump when you got the Times defending traditional gender roles. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1268.7s)]
*  They say gender is a spectrum and then turn right around and say a man shouldn't do interior decorating. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1275.3400000000001s)]
*  That'll be news to the homosexuals I hired to redo my basement. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1281.66s)]
*  I'm adding a pommel horse to the bondage room. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1287.1000000000001s)]
*  I think Kudlow's gonna like it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1293.26s)]
*  But what they're really saying is it's hard for us to trash Melania, which he offers us so little to trash. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1297.9s)]
*  They're so addicted to being mean girls. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1306.5400000000002s)]
*  Now they're getting meaner because she's not giving them a chance to be mean. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1308.7s)]
*  Because for sure, if Melania was redoing the Rose Garden, they'd give her hell for including thorns. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1312.22s)]
*  So absent any real dirt, the Times wants to paint Melania as an anomaly. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1317.98s)]
*  When in fact, she's as First Lady as you can get in style, sophistication, behavior, and role. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1323.1s)]
*  This after four years of the most unorthodox First Lady in history. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1329.58s)]
*  Jill ran the White House while orchestrating a cover-up for her half-dead husband. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1333.8999999999999s)]
*  She meddled in foreign policy and cabinet meetings. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1338.86s)]
*  Hell, she even demanded that the world believe she was a real doctor. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1341.5s)]
*  She let her confused husband offstage, dictated when and where he could go, and controlled media access. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1344.78s)]
*  Did the media ever probe into that? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  No. When the media would turn their biased eye to Jill, it was only to fawn. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1352.94s)]
*  It didn't bother them that Jill was effectively the president, despite nobody voting for her. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1357.9s)]
*  And while they coddled her, they mocked Melania, and then complain when she leaves them high and dry. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1363.02s)]
*  Maybe she thinks, hey, I didn't sign up for this, you know, like when I was on Outnumbered. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1368.7s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1372.94s)]
*  Consider that during her husband's first term, she wore a raincoat with a slogan the press didn't like, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1380.22s)]
*  and it became an entire news cycle. A raincoat. And unlike Joe, she was able to put it on all by herself. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1385.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, Dr. Jill wore stuff like this. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1394.94s)]
*  Seriously, who is her stylist? The Riddler? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1398.22s)]
*  The contrast is stark. Jill got all the accolades and no scrutiny. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1403.74s)]
*  Melania, no accolades, all scrutiny. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1408.14s)]
*  If I had an entire industry devoted to nitpicking every single thing I do [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1410.94s)]
*  and say, just because I married somebody they despise, I might need some private time as well. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1415.42s)]
*  That's why I dumped Taylor Swift. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1420.46s)]
*  The Dems love to say they're the party of women, unless it's a woman who thinks for herself and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1424.7s)]
*  quite literally does her own thing. In fact, Melania is the polar opposite of what the Dems [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1429.98s)]
*  want in a woman. See, women should think the same, scream about the same causes, and vote the same way. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1434.94s)]
*  It's why so many Democrat women look like this and not this. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1441.18s)]
*  So what if Melania would rather be seen and not heard? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1449.02s)]
*  The Dems just want you to be one of the heard. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1453.42s)]
*  Well, we've only got one lady on the panel, so Tom. Hi, kid. Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1459.98s)]
*  I have to go to you first because I find it interesting that there's nothing they can pin on [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1473.9s)]
*  her, so that becomes the flaw. They're like, I don't know, we have nothing to say about Melania. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1479.58s)]
*  Well, maybe that's a problem too. She's not doing anything. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1484.7s)]
*  And thank God she's okay. It's not like Kate Middleton, because if you remember in the UK, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1489.26s)]
*  when she was missing, people drummed up all of these conspiracy theories and really bullied her. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1494.54s)]
*  It never occurred to them that maybe she has cancer, and she did. And the same kind of bullying, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1499.5s)]
*  they were like, you're just making that up. And she's like, no, I actually have cancer and it [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1506.06s)]
*  really sucks and leave me alone. And eventually they had to eat crow and go away. She telegraphed [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1509.26s)]
*  that that's what she was going to do. You know, it's like if you're being bullied, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1516.3s)]
*  and why would you sit there in the same context and just take it for the sake of taking it? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1520.78s)]
*  So she told people, I'm going to live in Florida. I'm going to be in New York with my son when he [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  needs me while he's in school. And when I'm needed in Washington, I'll go there. Guess what? They have [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1530.3s)]
*  not been on the public teat for 60 years. Yes. They actually have their own money and she can [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1535.8999999999999s)]
*  afford to fly wherever she wants. When she wants to. I'm sorry. I thought that was feminism. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1540.62s)]
*  Yes. And they can't believe that she wouldn't want to spend her time in D.C., which is the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1545.66s)]
*  nation's capital and armpit. That's true. And I'm a noted feminist, Greg. Yes. I think, I mean, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1557.98s)]
*  it's amazing that the New York Times, the only way they can get anybody to look at their articles [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1566.6200000000001s)]
*  is if Trump trumpets them and he calls them the fake New York Times. And I think they were [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1570.14s)]
*  goading him. This was trolling Trump with the idea that he was doing women's work. Yes. Oh, yeah. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1575.58s)]
*  So they think they're going to get him and he's going to call him the fake New York Times. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1582.22s)]
*  They think Trump is so shallow that if they say that he's redecorating the White House, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1585.5s)]
*  he's going to get mad. But we all know that Trump loves to redecorate and we know he does [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1590.6999999999998s)]
*  the decorating because has you have you seen Trump Tower? Yeah. He definitely decorated that [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1595.74s)]
*  apartment. That's not Melania. That's totally Trump. Yeah. Yeah. He loves to put gold everywhere. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1600.1399999999999s)]
*  So speaking of gold, you're looking mighty tan, Walter. Yeah. So I don't know where to go with [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1607.74s)]
*  that. I know. It's stunning. And it is overwhelming. Can you compare and contrast our two first [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1615.98s)]
*  ladies in the past eight years? We had Dr. Jill Melania, Dr. Jill Melania. It was like a Melania [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1622.94s)]
*  sandwich. OK, I have a lot to say on this. I'll say it quickly cut me off when I get too much. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1628.14s)]
*  First of all, usually when you're the president's wife, the White House isn't your fourth worst house. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1635.1000000000001s)]
*  Number two, if I had the ability to have my wife be away, but no, through bodyguards at [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1651.18s)]
*  every second exactly where she was and what she was doing, I would tell her to go have fun, too. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1657.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, so secondly, yeah, exactly. He's not wondering what she's doing. I mean, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1663.42s)]

*  did you see her at the inauguration? She had that hat that covered her eyes. She had this, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1684.14s)]
*  you know, she looked like a cross between a supermodel and an assassin. Yeah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1688.5400000000002s)]
*  She was Lee Van Cleef. She's off on missions, baby. Yeah. Like if you have a wife like this, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1693.18s)]
*  who's able to penetrate foreign governments and embassies and highest reaches of, you know, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1698.7s)]
*  closed societies, you put her on missions. Um, Jill wasn't capable of missions. Nobody wanted [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1703.5800000000002s)]
*  her there. And when a first lady is around the house a lot, that usually means there's something [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1710.94s)]
*  wrong with the president. Yes. And this is his best argument for I'm capable. I don't need my, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1714.54s)]

*  wrong or drool, you know, it's a good point. It's like Charlie, uh, uh, Melania is a first lady. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1723.8999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Jill was a visiting angel. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1731.98s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. And I, and I think that that gangster hat that she wore at the inauguration [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1741.1s)]
*  was kind of the message to everybody that she was, she, she had had enough of this and she [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1746.1399999999999s)]

*  or Billy Jack, Billy Jack. And so, and so, you know, most of the people that go into the [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1756.3799999999999s)]
*  white house, you know, this is the pinnacle of a lifetime spent in politics. And for these people, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1760.7s)]
*  for the trumps, it's a, you know, this is a diversion from an incredibly accomplished life [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1765.6599999999999s)]
*  that they had led before this. That is, and this is completely different. They're bigger than this [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1771.34s)]
*  spot right now. And, you know, I love that all of Melania's detractors speak four languages less [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1776.1399999999999s)]
*  than she does. Yes. And they have no accomplishments in, say, the fashion world that she has. And I [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1783.02s)]
*  think that they do. They see, I think they're threatened by it. They don't know how to like [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1789.82s)]
*  wrap their brain around it because the idea that anybody would be in that position who doesn't [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1793.42s)]
*  worship at the altar of politics is somebody that they can't control. And that's what, of course, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1797.8200000000002s)]
*  we all love about both of the trumps. Yeah. And also they always say DC is Hollywood for ugly people. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1803.74s)]
*  Right. Why would Melania hang around them? You know, Melania posed nude. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1810.78s)]
*  I would never want to see any of her detractors naked. It's, but it's, it's Hollywood for ugly [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1815.42s)]
*  people, but also losers who have never actually accomplished something in the real world. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhv8CLLKHNI&t=1822.14s)]
