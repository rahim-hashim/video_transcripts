# Fox News Highlights - May 8th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs)
*  MAGA versus the naysayers. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=0.0s)]
*  After years of downplaying Biden's inflation, Democrats in the press want you to believe that they really care about the cost of living and middle class jobs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=5.4s)]
*  They're all singing, though, from the same hymnal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=13.68s)]
*  But the result of the Trump tariffs is that all these small businesses get clobbered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=16.6s)]
*  He issued across the board skyrocketing tariffs that are destroying businesses throughout the United States of America. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=20.12s)]
*  And he did it just because he wanted to issue some really cool tweets. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=27.4s)]
*  What I'm hearing from people all across the state of Minnesota, these tariffs are crippling my business. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  They are crushing me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=37.68s)]
*  What he has done is shock the economy of the country and the world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=38.8s)]
*  And we are not prepared for it, which is to say it's not just the price of consumer goods. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  It's also the jobs that are going to be lost. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=47.36s)]
*  You don't just get those back immediately. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=49.28s)]
*  Oh, now they care about middle class jobs. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=51.68s)]
*  And of course, our endless articles about the disruptive effects of Trump's policies, because after November shellacking, Democrats and their allies now pretend to be worried about the constituency they've repelled with their radical policies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=54.36s)]
*  So it's nonstop talk of Trump as tariffs causing disruptions, disruptions to the consumer, businesses. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=67.76s)]
*  And yes, as president, Trump has said repeatedly that we're in a transition phase, but any disruptions are temporary and necessary for the survival of America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=73.48s)]
*  But you know what wasn't temporary for five million Americans? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=83.88s)]
*  The offshoring of their jobs because of reckless trade policies that have been pushed for decades by a globalist establishment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=87.72s)]
*  Plus, you want to talk about disruptions? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Where was the media outrage over what happened in places like Akron or Pittsburgh or Youngstown, Rochester when their factories closed, families were destroyed, operations moved overseas? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=96.96s)]
*  They were given notice and they were told to learn code. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=109.88s)]
*  Factories are still closing down like an Ohio paper mill that has been in business since the eighteen hundreds. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=113.52s)]
*  It announced that its closing operations laying off 700 employees, including these men. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=119.72s)]
*  We found out it was absolute shock. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=125.48s)]
*  And I think everybody in the mill is still in shock. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=127.92s)]
*  You didn't think it was coming to Chillicothe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=129.92s)]
*  You thought it was happening in other places. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=131.4s)]
*  And then when it hits here, it just it just leaves you raw. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=134.2s)]
*  Tim Jenkins has dedicated most of his life to the mill, along with Jeff Allen, who both worked there for around 38 years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=136.72s)]
*  Me and Jeff's dad worked together and they retired from here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  And now we're going to do the same, but it's just not going to be on our terms. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=148.32s)]
*  Trump cares about people like this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=151.8s)]
*  Is paper an essential product? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, it is to that community. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  It was the glue that held it together. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=157.44s)]
*  Now, Trump's been watching these stories for 40 years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=159.8s)]
*  Entire regions of the country ripped apart because politicians didn't give a damn and other countries took advantage of our stupidity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=162.56s)]
*  Everything he's doing on trade right now, everything is designed to try to reinvigorate investment in America and remedy those past wrongs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=169.72s)]
*  But of course, the MAGA hating media, they're hoping for a recession, cheering one on, and they want Trump to fail. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=177.48s)]
*  So it's been more than a month, if you can believe it, since Donald Trump announced his sweeping and pretty ridiculous tariffs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=182.76s)]
*  But Mr. Art of the deal, as he calls himself, has not yet struck a single trade deal, not a single one with any single country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  Oh, not a single one. Bet Jen wishes she had held that thought. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=197.96s)]
*  This deal just fell into place. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=202.0s)]
*  The prime minister did a fantastic job. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=203.72s)]
*  His representatives are total professionals and they got along well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=206.08s)]
*  And it just seemed to work. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=209.4s)]
*  Things are going to move very quickly both ways. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump was tired with the slow conventional approach to trade deals. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  He felt they didn't get to the reset that we needed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  So we had to try something more drastic to change the dynamic. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=220.28s)]
*  He described his deliberate disruption theory. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=223.76s)]
*  I think one of the reasons it did is because we blew up the whole system. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=226.84s)]
*  If we would have just been dealing with you separately or, you know, country by country, we blew up the whole system. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=230.8s)]
*  It was very fair to the United and very unfair to the United States. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=237.0s)]
*  And I think because of that, this worked out so nicely. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=240.32s)]
*  And I'm honored that it was the first deal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=244.76s)]
*  Yeah, the globalists blew it up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=247.4s)]
*  Trump's trying to fix it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=248.96s)]
*  And that's just the beginning. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=250.28s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said today that dozens of deals will roll out in the next 30 days. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=251.48s)]
*  And China Talks are next. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=256.92s)]
*  Scott's going to be going to Switzerland, meeting with China. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=259.36s)]
*  And, you know, they very much want to make a deal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=264.36s)]
*  We can we can all play games. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=267.36s)]
*  Who made the first call? Who didn't make the... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=269.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It only matters what happens in that room. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=271.12s)]
*  But I will tell you that China very much wants to make a deal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=274.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll see how that works out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=278.2s)]
*  Every country throughout the last 40, 50 years has literally ripped off the United States on trade, on military, on protection, on all the different things. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  And we are now making fair deals. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  Finally. And by the way, why does China need to make a deal? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  JPMorgan is projecting that they expect a 75 to 80 percent drop in imports from China this year because of these higher tariffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=297.16s)]
*  Yeah, despite China's tough talk, they can't replace our consumers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=310.48s)]
*  China's factories are under pressure, including ones that make American flags. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=314.68s)]
*  This is a scenario Trump wanted to create. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=320.88s)]
*  And to all the complainers, you know what I say? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=323.28s)]
*  What is your alternative to allow China to dominate global trade and ultimately destroy our own independence? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=326.44s)]
*  But the defenders of the old globalist status quo, who see no issue with the decline of U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=334.04s)]
*  manufacturing, they're hung up on the process. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=338.68s)]
*  Don't back China into a corner. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=342.12s)]
*  The market was very optimistic, very happy about the idea that there was a UK deal today. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=343.88s)]
*  But I think we solved the problem we didn't have with UK today. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=349.2s)]
*  That's what that trade deal was. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=352.6s)]
*  But no, I wouldn't structure it this way. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=354.04s)]
*  I would not shock the economy, but this shock system of coming up with something crazy and then backing off it over time is creating unnecessary panic, unnecessary losses. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=355.92s)]
*  Panic on people who made a lot of money off the backs of the American middle class. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=368.64s)]
*  What about the future gains that are coming to hardworking Americans? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=372.56s)]
*  Do they count? I think we can say that we'll be close to 10 trillion dollars of investment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=375.88s)]
*  I think we're actually at that number now, if you add up some of the ones we haven't heard about yet. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we have some going up right now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=387.76s)]
*  They have plants going up and they haven't even spoken to us. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=389.4s)]
*  They're doing it because of the tariffs and tariffs have always been used against us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=391.88s)]
*  Trillions pouring in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=397.12s)]
*  We're going to be keeping track of the progress because if investment of that magnitude really does materialize, yeah, this truly will be the golden age. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump's team is working around the clock trying to do something transformational. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=408.55999999999995s)]
*  How many times do politicians actually do that? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=412.44s)]
*  Almost never, because they're trying to ensure that 10 and 20 years from now we're a stronger, freer, more prosperous and, yes, happier country. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=414.84s)]
*  Ambitious, but it's the right thing to do. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=426.4s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  It wasn't a ghost. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=430.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's back. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=432.0s)]
*  The revenge tour is in full swing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=433.4s)]
*  First stop was the BBC. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=435.32s)]
*  Today, the View. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=436.76s)]
*  After a little trouble finding a seat, he called the country sexist. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=438.32s)]
*  Why do you think the vice president lost? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  And were you surprised? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president's most qualified person to be president. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=448.55999999999995s)]
*  She is. She's qualified to be president of the United States of America. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  But I was surprised. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=457.11999999999995s)]
*  I wasn't surprised because they went the route of the sexist route, the whole route. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=458.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a woman, she's this, she's that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=464.92s)]
*  Really, I've never seen quite as successful and a consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country and a woman of mixed race. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=468.56s)]
*  Biden just said he knew Kamala was going to lose. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=481.04s)]
*  He said, of course she was going to lose. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=483.48s)]
*  She's a woman. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  You saw what happened to Hillary, America's sexist. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  Biden went on the View and said, I told you so. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=489.04s)]
*  You never should have staged the coup. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  I can't believe you thought Kamala was going to win, you idiots. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=493.12s)]
*  Remember, he only endorsed her as payback to Barack after he got whacked. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=496.4s)]
*  Kamala's whole campaign blew up on the View. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=501.4s)]
*  Remember, she couldn't think of anything she'd do differently. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=503.68s)]
*  Joe just went back to the scene of the crime. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  There has been some reporting that you encouraged her for there to be no daylight between the two of you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  First, is that true? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=515.48s)]
*  And do you think in retrospect that she should have tried to differentiate all the wins that your administration had? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, look, first of all, I did not advise her to say that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=525.28s)]
*  Number one, like I said, I was vice president. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=529.92s)]
*  I understand the role. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=532.2399999999999s)]
*  Number one. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=533.9599999999999s)]
*  Number two, I think it was I think she was talking about she was wouldn't have changed the successes we've had, not as opposed to that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=534.52s)]
*  We wouldn't change anything at all. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=544.5999999999999s)]
*  She has to be your own person. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  And she was she was part of every success we had. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=548.76s)]
*  Biden did it again. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=552.28s)]
*  He still won't let Kamala have any daylight between them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=553.64s)]
*  She's going to be running in 28 and Biden's going to be on a rocking chair saying, I taught her everything she knows. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=556.88s)]
*  Then he says he shouldn't have stepped down. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=563.88s)]
*  Knowing what you know now, do you think you would have beat him? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=567.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's still got seven million fewer votes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=570.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=573.04s)]
*  OK, a lot of people didn't show up. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=573.84s)]
*  Number one, number one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=576.48s)]
*  Number two, the they're very close in those those toss up states. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=577.6400000000001s)]
*  It was what it wasn't a slam dunk. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  None of this makes sense. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  If you thought you could have beaten them, why did you step down? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  If you knew Kamala would lose, why'd you step down? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=593.44s)]
*  Why exactly did you? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=596.8800000000001s)]
*  Former president, you served under Barack Obama, George Clooney, a longtime supporter of yours, major Democratic donor Chuck Schumer, your dear friend, Nancy Pelosi, also had expressed concerns about your ability to do the job for four more years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=598.24s)]
*  Can I ask what your relationship is with President Obama and how you address those concerns that they raised? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=610.56s)]
*  Look, I think that the only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  It's a simple proposition. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  And so that's why I got out of the race. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=631.16s)]
*  I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=633.16s)]
*  I'm not being facetious. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=637.92s)]
*  I'm being deadly earnest about that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=638.8399999999999s)]
*  If Biden knew Kamala was going to lose and you knew he was going to win, how was that putting country above party? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=640.68s)]
*  If you're a Democrat, it's the opposite. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=646.5999999999999s)]
*  It's putting party above country. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=648.4s)]
*  What does Biden care if his party is divided if he beats Trump? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=650.92s)]
*  If Trump's a dictator, like he says he was, why would Biden purposely lose an election? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=654.16s)]
*  Now Trump's president and the Democrats are more divided than ever. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=660.0s)]
*  This is why he went on the view any real journalist would have picked up on the flaws of that logic and say, Joe, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=664.04s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=670.04s)]
*  Finally, they got to the debate. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=672.52s)]
*  Well, you know what freaked everybody out was that debate. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It wasn't a great night. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=679.28s)]
*  It was a bad night. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=681.0s)]
*  Terrible night. And everybody lost their mind. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=681.9599999999999s)]
*  Why do you think people bought into it, especially the Democrats? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=684.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, we still were winning primaries. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=688.88s)]
*  We're still doing everything. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party at large didn't buy into it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  But the Democratic leadership and some of the very significant contributors did. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=697.48s)]
*  When I left the race, Kamala had hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  She had the best organized campaign. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say something outrageous. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=708.68s)]
*  I've not lost many debates in my life. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  I've been pretty good at doing that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=713.04s)]
*  I was sick. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=715.0s)]
*  Biden says the Democrat Party was still behind him. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=716.52s)]
*  He just had the sniffles. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=719.16s)]
*  Pelosi and donors didn't understand that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=720.84s)]
*  The big guy claims he was on track to win. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=723.68s)]
*  He says his campaign operation was better than Trump's. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=725.68s)]
*  And he handed Kamala the world's fattest war chest. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  And he says it's not his fault. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=730.76s)]
*  He was just too successful. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=732.4799999999999s)]
*  All he wants is a thank you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=734.92s)]
*  Jill was there and she says Barack should have shown her husband a little more respect. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  I went onto the stage after the debate. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=742.52s)]
*  I mean, we all saw it. It was terrible. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=744.8s)]
*  And so Joe looked at me and he said, I, well, I'll use screwed up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  He said, I didn't say that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=751.4s)]
*  And I said, yeah, we all know Joe Biden. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  We know what he said. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=755.7199999999999s)]
*  And I said, yeah, you did, Joe. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=757.36s)]
*  But we have hundreds of people waiting for us. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=759.28s)]
*  Put your shoulders back. Walk out there. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=761.12s)]
*  You know, be who you are. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=763.12s)]
*  And we were not going to let 90 minutes of a debate define his presidency and all those years of service. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=765.12s)]
*  Jill just admitted her husband bombed the debate. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=774.16s)]
*  But here's what she said right after. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=776.24s)]
*  Joe, you did such a great job. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=779.48s)]
*  You answered every question. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=781.28s)]
*  Everyone else who watched the debate saw a man who couldn't be president and who should never have been president. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=785.48s)]
*  The ladies asked Joe all about the tell all books quoting insiders who said he was mentally unfit and the White House covered it up. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=791.24s)]
*  Listen, you're wrong. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=798.12s)]
*  There's nothing to sustain that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  Number one. Number two. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=803.52s)]
*  You know, think of what what we're left with. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  We're left with a circumstance where we we had an insurrection. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=807.84s)]
*  I started the nonsense of civil war. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=813.08s)]
*  We went to work and we got it done. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=816.52s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that that well, I'm well, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=818.72s)]
*  I know, listen, you know, one of the things I think is that the people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  And they didn't see how hard Joe worked every single day. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=832.36s)]
*  I mean, it was nonstop. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=837.76s)]
*  It's the White House. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=839.44s)]
*  And Joe worked really hard. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=840.92s)]
*  I think he was a great president. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=843.16s)]
*  You look at things today. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=845.04s)]
*  Give me Joe Biden anytime. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=846.84s)]
*  Dr. Jill just took over that interview like Belichick's girlfriend. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=849.36s)]
*  What was that? And none of what she's saying is true. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=852.24s)]
*  Jen Psaki said Joe never got up early once unless it was like really important. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=855.72s)]
*  And they'd call lids at four o'clock and you'd never see him again. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=861.12s)]
*  Remember the marks Joe had on his face from the sleeping machine? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=864.64s)]
*  We saw that at noon. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=867.92s)]
*  There were stretches where he didn't see the president in public for three to four days, sometimes a whole week. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=870.64s)]
*  But Jill says he wasn't hiding. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=875.96s)]
*  I did not create a cocoon around him. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=879.04s)]
*  I mean, you saw him in the Oval Office. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=881.8s)]
*  You saw him making speeches. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=884.28s)]
*  He wasn't hiding somewhere. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=886.16s)]
*  I didn't have him, you know, sequestered in some place. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's what she had. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=891.52s)]
*  Was that hurtful to you when they were describing you as Lady Macbeth? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=895.68s)]
*  Yes, it was very hurtful. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=898.5999999999999s)]
*  It was very hurtful, especially from some of our so-called friends. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=900.36s)]
*  They say in Washington, if you want a friend, get a dog. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=904.92s)]
*  Well, the Biden's got a dog and he bit everybody. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=907.68s)]
*  Jill was running cabinet meetings just like she was running this interview. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=914.52s)]
*  The projects, the benefits. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  How do you lead the world without having the best infrastructure? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=919.64s)]
*  How do you lead the world without having the best health care in the world? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=922.0s)]
*  How do you lead the world without having the best education system? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=924.72s)]
*  How do you lead the world and you don't have that done? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=927.36s)]
*  The truth is Joe can't talk, can't walk and couldn't govern. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=930.56s)]
*  No one wants to hear from him. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=933.84s)]
*  One Democrat says this. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=935.4s)]
*  I don't think he's reading the room at the moment, but the Revenge Tour isn't all about revenge. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=937.12s)]
*  It's about money. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=942.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden Inc. has collapsed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=944.2s)]
*  All those Biden grandkids had a lavish lifestyle, which they very much liked. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=946.96s)]
*  Hunter made hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=951.32s)]
*  Joe, as a former president, is not in a position to get the same kind of paid speeches, corporate boards, book deal. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=955.24s)]
*  Biden Inc. needs a source of revenue. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=962.36s)]
*  And Hunter does, even though he was pardoned and he's not going to prison, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=964.96s)]
*  Hunter does not have great earning capacity. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=968.2800000000001s)]
*  The reality that Biden Inc., the trough is empty, the spigot has shut down. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  They need a way to get back in the game to make big money. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=977.12s)]
*  Biden left office and the whole extended family suddenly went broke and no one's paying his speaking fees. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=980.84s)]
*  So the only way they can survive is write their own tell all. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=986.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm writing another book. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  Good. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  Like 6,000 people are. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=993.6s)]
*  I got to write a presidential memoir. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=996.84s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=998.84s)]
*  But they told me they had to do it within a year. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=999.32s)]
*  No one's ever won, done one in a year. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1001.0400000000001s)]
*  Joe says, don't read those half dozen tell alls from White House insiders. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1003.7600000000001s)]
*  He says he's going to write his own book and he's bragging it'll be done in a year, right in time for the midterms. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1007.9200000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are going to love it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1013.48s)]
*  Jill was keeping a secret diary during her time as first lady. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1015.44s)]
*  Something about the Bidens in diaries. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1018.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1020.84s)]
*  And it's supposed to be explosive. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  Insiders say a Jill Biden book could be worth 30 million in a deal. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  And the Bidens just hired a crisis manager. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1029.8s)]
*  They've been taking a beating with all these exposés. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1032.4399999999998s)]
*  The next book that's about to drop supposed to be the most damaging. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1035.4399999999998s)]
*  Jake Tapper's tell all. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  He obviously didn't write it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  He has a co-author, but it's the worst one yet. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1041.28s)]
*  There's a battle going on over the party's legacy. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1044.2s)]
*  They want to purge Biden from history, absolve themselves of any responsibility for the last four years. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  They say they had no idea Joe was that bad and they had nothing to do with the cover up. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1052.36s)]
*  It was just a few people like Jill Hunter and Biden's Delaware guys. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1057.2800000000002s)]
*  Biden's saying, no, no, no, no, you're not taking me down. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1061.0400000000002s)]
*  I was president best four years since FDR and I'm not going down without a fight. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1064.2s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, he's about to give him a little push. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1069.68s)]
*  The White House is looking to release the her tapes. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  We've all read the transcripts and it was no bueno. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1076.5600000000002s)]
*  Now, if they come out, we'll all hear Joe in his own words, not remember when he was vice president. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1079.5200000000002s)]
*  Biden and his crisis managers are bracing for impact. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight, a bold new chapter in our nation's storied history is unfolding right before your eyes. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1091.04s)]
*  A major trade deal with the UK is the first of many to come. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  The economy is on the mend. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1101.2s)]
*  Law and order is being restored coast to coast. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1102.92s)]
*  Left wing agitators, they are finally facing consequences, including deportation in spite of lawfare. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1106.24s)]
*  Our crumbling infrastructure that pothole Pete ignored and degraded for years is finally getting the attention it deserves. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1113.24s)]
*  We need the skies to be safe. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1121.04s)]
*  And as per usual, Joe Biden is completely oblivious to all of it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1124.08s)]
*  We'll show you the sad interview that he and Dr. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1127.96s)]
*  Jill Biden had on that hard hitting news show. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1131.44s)]
*  But we begin with today's massive announcement. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1134.36s)]
*  Watch this. This morning, I'm thrilled to announce that we have reached a breakthrough [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1137.04s)]
*  trade deal with the United Kingdom, credible country. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  Today is a victory day for World War Two. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1146.52s)]
*  We won the war together exactly 80 years ago, so there could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's beautiful weather out. I will tell you that here. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  Beautiful weather. So perfect outside. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1160.36s)]
*  But it's really in particular the agreement with one of our closest and most cherished allies. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1163.6399999999999s)]
*  And we're so happy that that's the way it worked out. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1171.9199999999998s)]
*  I want to thank Prime Minister Stammer and his very talented team for their outstanding work and partnership. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1175.24s)]
*  Today's agreement with the UK is the first in a series of agreements on trade that my administration has been negotiating over the past four weeks. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1182.8s)]
*  With this deal, the UK joins the United States in affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1192.1999999999998s)]
*  of international trade. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1200.8799999999999s)]

*  And today it started with our closest ally. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1209.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, this deal cuts red tape between our two countries. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1212.32s)]
*  It fast tracks trade through customs. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1215.36s)]
*  It also eliminates British tariffs on American steel, aluminum and opens the British market to American ethanol, agriculture, machinery. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1217.72s)]
*  In response, the Dow, S&P, NASDAQ all rallied today. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1226.56s)]
*  The markets now have been up 13 out of the past 15 trading days. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1230.52s)]
*  Funny how the mainstream media doesn't report that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1234.64s)]
*  Now, the highly respected Atlanta Fed raised its quarterly growth projections in just this week. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1237.4s)]
*  It more than doubled to 2.3 percent from a week ago. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1244.04s)]
*  Also, Goldman Sachs fears of recession are subsiding. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  Nonstop hand ringing from the legacy media mob and Democrats was yet again totally unfounded and ridiculous. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1251.8s)]
*  And keep in mind, this is only one deal. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1259.96s)]
*  This is only the beginning. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1262.24s)]
*  And remember, on Saturday, Scott Besson will be meeting in Geneva with China representatives. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  According to my sources, there are in fact numerous major agreements in the pipeline. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Besson is saying deals with 18 countries, big countries currently in the works. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1274.08s)]
*  Now analysts at Goldman Sachs are even predicting a looming deal with the People's Republic of China. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1279.72s)]
*  Scott Besson, Chinese representatives, they will have that meeting on Saturday. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1284.76s)]
*  And just off the coast, Taiwan is not even waiting for a new deal. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1288.96s)]
*  China Airlines just ordered 14 brand new Boeing 777 planes with options for many more. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1292.84s)]
*  Here's my message to the Democratic Party, the legacy media mob. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1300.88s)]
*  Nobody cares about your doom and gloom and your hope and prayer for American failure. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1304.72s)]
*  The American people elected a disruptor to the White House, someone who was not afraid to shake things up, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1309.68s)]
*  someone who wouldn't settle for the status quo, for the institutionalism that is rotting D.C. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1315.04s)]
*  And that's exactly what the American people are getting. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1321.88s)]
*  For 50 to 60 years, America has been ripped off and abused and taken advantage of. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1324.48s)]
*  And Donald Trump has said, enough's enough. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1329.72s)]
*  And by the way, this is for the American economy, American manufacturing, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1332.1599999999999s)]
*  and the people that make this country great, American workers. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1337.84s)]
*  Now, remember, his threat of tariffs also resulted in over $8 trillion in commitments for manufacturing [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1341.32s)]
*  over the next four years in sectors where we need it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1348.6s)]
*  Cars, pharmaceuticals, chips and much, much more. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  We don't need to be dependent on any other country ever. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1355.1599999999999s)]
*  And now our country has a chance to be better than ever before, from sea to shining sea, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1358.04s)]
*  from the Arctic to the Gulf of America. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1363.72s)]
*  In case you missed it, by the way, the House, they just passed legislation, angry Democrats, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1367.2s)]
*  officially renaming the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1371.9199999999998s)]
*  Naturally, every Democrat voted against it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1374.48s)]
*  What are they for anyway? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1376.8s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1387.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1391.8s)]

*  when they found Peter Dinklage. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1421.8s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1435.8s)]
*  Joe, of course, was accompanied by his wife, Jill. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1437.8s)]
*  The View said they were looking forward to interviewing the ex-president, as well as [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1440.8s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1443.8s)]
*  We'll get to more of that later. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1450.8s)]
*  On a recent podcast, Simon Cowell said he once turned down a couple's offer of $150,000 [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1452.8s)]

*  Tensions between India and Pakistan are still on the rise. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1494.8s)]
*  As a result, the rest of the world fears they will have nowhere to turn for tech support. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1499.8s)]
*  It's a joke! [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1509.8s)]
*  According to a new study, only 39% of Americans would donate an organ to a loved one. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1512.8s)]
*  But one American actually volunteered to show you his organ. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1517.8s)]
*  The Trump administration plans to release the audio of President Biden's interview with [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1525.8s)]
*  special counsel Robert Herr, which Herr said revealed a well-meaning elderly man with a [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1529.8s)]
*  poor memory. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1534.8s)]
*  Vegas oddsmakers are already taking bets on how many times Biden farts. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1535.8s)]
*  And finally, Ellen DeGeneres has shared videos of her new life in the English countryside [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1543.8s)]
*  cutting grass. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1549.8s)]
*  It's not that surprising considering she's been mowing lawns for years. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1550.8s)]
*  She loves to landscape! [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1556.8s)]
*  She loves presenting John Deere for years! [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1559.8s)]
*  Yes! [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1562.8s)]
*  You people go right to the lesbianism. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1564.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1566.8s)]
*  So Times Square just unveiled a 12-foot tall plus-sized statue of a black woman in a pantsuit [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1568.8s)]
*  who looks like she's about to confront her baby daddy on Jerry Springer. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1575.8s)]
*  This inspiring monument was erected as a, quote, stark contrast to the two white men [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1579.8s)]
*  who have statues there already. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1584.8s)]
*  Father Francis Duffy, a highly decorated World War I hero, and George Cohen, who helped to [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1586.8s)]
*  further Broadway and the music industry. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1591.8s)]
*  The artist claims that the statue's posture is a nod to Michelangelo's David. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1593.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1599.8s)]
*  I know! [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1601.8s)]
*  I can barely tell them apart! [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1603.8s)]
*  Though the other guy mistakenly called Steve Doocy Charles Payne. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1607.8s)]
*  Now, we're told the statue should instigate meaningful connections. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1614.8s)]
*  But it's just steps away from an actual meaningful connection, where a gang attacked two NYPD [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1619.8s)]
*  cops who interrupted a robbery. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1626.8s)]
*  Why not make a statue of that to warn tourists? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1628.8s)]
*  Now, Tom Homan has vowed to deport those Tren de Aragua wannabes, but incredibly, ice was turned away [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1631.8s)]
*  because, shocker, New York's a sanctuary city. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1637.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, at Columbia, pro-Hamas agitators continue to wreak havoc, taking over the school's library. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1641.8s)]
*  After all, it's full of their greatest enemy, books. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1646.8s)]
*  It pays to note that the 80 arrested 61 were female, and some of them even had vaginas. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1651.8s)]
*  So how did we get here? Well, it's easy. The lefties traded law enforcement for performance art. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1663.8s)]
*  And the results are written in blood. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1669.8s)]
*  Remember the defund the police movement? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1671.8s)]
*  A new study confirms what any sane person already knew. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1673.8s)]
*  Less policing equals more murder. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1676.8s)]
*  Following the 2020 Summer of Love, police stops and arrests dropped by 40 percent across 15 major American cities, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1679.8s)]
*  leading to a massive rise in murders. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1686.8s)]
*  By 2021, national homicides increased by 7,000 over 2019. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1688.8s)]
*  It's as if CNN's entire audience had vanished. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1694.8s)]
*  They tried to lie about crime dropping, but like tickets to see Snow White, people weren't buying it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1697.8s)]
*  But from 2021 to 2024, as cities reinstated proactive policing, murders dropped by almost 40 percent. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1702.8s)]
*  Wow. Now I understand why we have cops. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1710.8s)]
*  They aren't just to show up and strip at Kudlow's hot tub parties. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1714.8s)]
*  Those were good times. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1722.8s)]
*  Those were good times. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1725.8s)]
*  And just in time, a poll shows that most Americans, especially blacks, feel that George Floyd's death didn't lead to any meaningful reforms. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1727.8s)]
*  They probably weren't happy with a bunch of white coeds telling them they don't need cops in their neighborhoods, and then those coeds leave. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1735.8s)]
*  So what about all those slogans, all those street murals turned out to be worth as much as Kamala for president t-shirts? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1742.8s)]
*  Sadly, we learned that BLM actually stood for Black Leaders Mansions. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1751.8s)]
*  So we're not safer. We're not more equal. We're just poorer, angrier and scared to take the subway. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1756.8s)]
*  And what about the communities that defund was supposed to help? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1762.8s)]
*  Anti-police policies hurt them the most, blacks in higher crime areas. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1766.8s)]
*  Here in New York, a billion dollars cut from the NYPD budget. Cop retirements up and recruitment down, and crime soared. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1771.8s)]
*  Stores closed, loved ones never came home, as their subway rides turned into mobile asylums. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1778.8s)]
*  It's called the Ferguson Effect, a rise in violent crime when you reduce the police force. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1783.8s)]
*  And like J.B. Pritzker in the desert, I saw it coming from a mile away. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1788.8s)]
*  The Ferguson Effect is a real thing. The George Floyd Effect is a real thing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1795.8s)]
*  We saw this coming. We saw that the, what do you call it, the Ferguson Effect take hold. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1800.8s)]
*  That led to destructions of cities, decimation of the police forces and morale. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1805.8s)]
*  And now they may, the result is what you're seeing is the Ferguson Effect is now the law of the land. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1810.8s)]
*  Mmm, I know what you're thinking. He's hot. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1817.8s)]
*  And clairvoyant. That's why I know what you're thinking. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1823.8s)]
*  In a way, that statue represents America's blue cities, a big hollow gesture that threatens to crush everyday people. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1828.8s)]
*  Chicago, Oakland, SF, Portland, Seattle, Memphis, you get the idea. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1835.8s)]
*  So when you hear all the lefty BS about criminal justice reform, think of this statue. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1840.8s)]
*  Because like everything, it's all for show. The Dems aren't looking to make you safer. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1844.8s)]
*  They're stuck on political theater, singing horribly, filibustering nonsense, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1849.8s)]
*  flying away to brown nose gang bangers, demanding due process for millions of unvetted illegals. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1854.8s)]
*  So as cops get jumped, we get a 12 foot gargoyle. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1860.8s)]
*  And the people who suffer, not the elites, it's shopkeepers, subway riders, working women, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1863.8s)]
*  the same communities the clueless libs claim to help. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1868.8s)]
*  Hell, if they really want to get people talking, why not sculpt a murder victim? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1872.8s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1876.8s)]
*  His act is the reason we don't have him on more often, comedian Joe Mackey. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1881.8s)]
*  He was once voted best dressed at a nude beach. Host of Kudlow on Fox Business, Larry Kudlow. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1889.8s)]
*  MTV gave this woman her start and a loaf of bread will make her fart. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1899.8s)]
*  Host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1904.8s)]
*  And he causes more old ladies to faint than open casket funerals. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1910.8s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian, former NBA world champion, Tony. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1915.8s)]
*  Joe, in the green room, you told me that the woman in the statue was not fat enough for you. Care to comment? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1922.8s)]
*  Greg, that is true. I do love a little bit of junk in the trunk and there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1929.8s)]
*  More of the woman to love. That's what I say. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1934.8s)]
*  But I will say this, if you wanted to make a statue of a random black woman that hasn't accomplished anything, you could have made one of Michelle Obama. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1937.8s)]
*  Just teasing. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1945.8s)]
*  I will say this, I think this is a great piece of art because art is supposed to reflect the times. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1951.8s)]
*  And here is a large portion of society that doesn't care about actions and results and consequences. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1956.8s)]
*  All they care about is group identity to make their judgments. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1965.8s)]
*  If an in-group does something good, if an out-group does something bad. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1968.8s)]
*  And that's when you understand that lens, you can understand the left very well. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1972.8s)]
*  That's how Disney can protest Florida's so-called don't say gay bill and then build a theme park in Abu Dhabi where being gay will get you beheaded because it's who's doing it. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1976.8s)]
*  It's a non-Western country. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1986.8s)]
*  So they're the in-group. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1988.8s)]
*  And it's okay for me to say that because a lot of people on the Internet think that I'm trans. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1990.8s)]
*  Uh-huh, that is true. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1995.8s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=1999.8s)]
*  Tyrus loves the kid. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2004.8s)]
*  Wait, I thought you were. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2006.8s)]
*  No. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2007.8s)]
*  No? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2008.8s)]
*  So it doesn't count. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2009.8s)]
*  Not even like a little lowercase t? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2011.8s)]
*  I guess Abu Dhabi, I won't be heading there. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2013.8s)]
*  I'm getting. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2018.8s)]
*  Larry, Larry, Larry Kudlow. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2020.8s)]
*  I'm getting with less. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2023.8s)]
*  Selhi Kudlow. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2025.8s)]
*  Are you surprised the funding the police resulted in more killings? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2027.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a shocking, shocking outcome, really. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2031.8s)]
*  But you know that whole, you think about it, that whole story. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2034.8s)]
*  George Floyd, the BLM. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2038.8s)]
*  What changed? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2043.8s)]
*  What changed exactly? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2045.8s)]
*  I never understood this. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2047.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2049.8s)]
*  I don't think this was a racist country to begin with. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2051.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2054.8s)]
*  People wouldn't disagree, but I don't think it was a racist. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2055.8s)]
*  Do we have bad apples? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2058.8s)]
*  Yes, okay, on all sides. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2060.8s)]
*  But we were not a racist country. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2062.8s)]
*  And I don't think that people should forget all the great civil rights legislation that was passed in the last how many decades? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2064.8s)]
*  Particularly the 1960s. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2072.8s)]
*  And it was enforced. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2074.8s)]
*  I do think the left has a fixation on everyone's racist. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2076.8s)]
*  If I don't like it, it's racist. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2081.8s)]
*  If I don't like you, it's racist. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2083.8s)]
*  If I don't like you, it's racist. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2085.8s)]
*  And I think that's utter nonsense. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2087.8s)]
*  And the last thought I had is the left wanted DEI before Trump came in and took it out. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2089.8s)]
*  DEI, okay. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2095.8s)]
*  DEI and its ultraaffirmative action is probably the most racist thing we've seen in decades and helped to spawn all of this anti-Semitism that is occurring on college campuses and other places as well. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2098.8s)]
*  So I would say it backfired. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2114.8s)]
*  It was stupid. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2117.8s)]
*  And it's just the projection of the left and that the country is completely rejecting what the left is thinking about. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2118.8s)]
*  Well said. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2127.8s)]
*  All right, Kennedy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2134.8s)]
*  There's so much in that monologue that just shined. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2135.8s)]
*  Larry's are yours. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2139.8s)]
*  61 out of 80 of the people arrested in Colombia were chicks. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2141.8s)]
*  Babes. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2146.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2147.8s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2148.8s)]
*  Honey's. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2149.8s)]
*  Hotty's. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2150.8s)]
*  Broads. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2151.8s)]
*  Broads. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2152.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2153.8s)]
*  If you were a guy, why would you want to go to college? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2154.8s)]
*  And if you were going to go to college, why would you want to go to Colombia? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2156.8s)]
*  You know, it's like if it's not and it's not just students who are screaming in your face, it's T.A.'s. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2159.8s)]
*  It's faculty members. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2165.8s)]
*  It's the people who actually lord the power over you. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2166.8s)]
*  You know, it's like you go to a big school like that. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2169.8s)]
*  The professors aren't the ones who give you grades. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2171.8s)]
*  It's your T.A.'s who are only a couple years older than you. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2173.8s)]
*  And if you don't fall in line with their group think and their lockstep and in this case their goose step, then they're going to fail you. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2177.8s)]
*  You know, it's like it used to be a degree from Colombia was worth something. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2185.8s)]
*  Now it actually might be better to fail out of the school so you can go somewhere else so a rational school can throw you a lifeline. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2189.8s)]
*  It would be better to go to Colombia where the hot chicks are than Colombia. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2197.8s)]
*  Because they have big booties and that bogota booger sugar that everyone loves. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2203.8s)]
*  But as for the, I won't be heading to the college. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2211.8s)]
*  Oh, a little decapitation humor there, Tyrus. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2219.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2222.8s)]
*  Don't lose your head, guys. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2223.8s)]
*  So did we need this study to tell us about the Ferguson effect? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2226.8s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2230.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, I got to talk on, speak on the statue because it's all connected. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2231.8s)]
*  You know, if it wasn't for the Black Lives Matter scam hustle, I don't think it would have inspired a lot of not just black people but people of color across the country to go, you know what, that doesn't represent me or who I am. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2238.8s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2253.8s)]
*  I don't want any part of it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2254.8s)]
*  And I think it made people more comfortable with saying, no, no, I'm going to stand up for character. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2255.8s)]
*  And the thing about having a statue is you want to honor life achievement. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2259.8s)]
*  People who have become great, they've shown greatness or they were courage in a time of travesty or whatever. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2264.8s)]
*  And that's why you have, you know, they talk about the old, the two white guys. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2270.8s)]
*  They weren't, it wasn't Earl and Bob having a subway sandwich. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2273.8s)]
*  It was two men of character who just happened to be white who did something that needed to be remembered and stories told. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2277.8s)]
*  And the other side is we just will take any of the stories that we've heard from the people who have been there. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2283.8s)]
*  We just will take any obese, pissed off, hands on their hip, confrontational, because there's that's most of them are like. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2288.8s)]
*  So they'll identify with that statue. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2296.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2298.8s)]
*  Nobody would want that statue made of them. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2299.8s)]
*  Even if you look like that, you still would not want that statue made like that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2302.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2308.8s)]
*  No one would want that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2309.8s)]
*  So the actual saluting of it is like saying you're fine the way it is. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2311.8s)]
*  I mean, look at the body language alone. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2316.8s)]
*  Whoever wants any man want to come home from a hard day's work and she's at the door like this. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2319.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2324.8s)]
*  You just got to back the truck up and be like, nope, not dealing with tonight. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2325.8s)]
*  And that's the problem with the left is they bank on the racism. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2331.8s)]
*  They also bank that that most of us look like that and have that attitude. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2336.8s)]
*  And so there's no one's going to get behind it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2340.8s)]
*  No other person. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2342.8s)]
*  There's no little girl going, mommy, I want to be like that statue. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2343.8s)]
*  When I grow up. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2345.8s)]
*  And if it was about promoting black women, there is thousands of black women in this country who have done amazing things. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2349.8s)]
*  There's people, women of color. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2356.8s)]
*  You could have put up there. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2359.8s)]
*  Hell, even I can't whoopie Goldberg for her acting roles, color purple. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2362.8s)]
*  You could have made a statue of her. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2366.8s)]
*  And if you made it exactly like her, I guarantee you when they pulled the robe off, she'd be like, I don't like it. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2368.8s)]
*  I don't look like that. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2372.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2373.8s)]
*  Up next, Joe and Jill hit up the view. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQcVmLZOAs&t=2374.8s)]
