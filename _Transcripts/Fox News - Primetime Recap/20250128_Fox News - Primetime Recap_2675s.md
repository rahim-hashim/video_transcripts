# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 27, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U)
*  I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington. Tonight, as always, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=0.0s)]
*  Just getting started. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=5.28s)]
*  Nobody's coming in and nobody's coming now because they know they're not going to be able to come in. So we've really stopped [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=11.52s)]
*  something that was very, very serious. But we have to get the bad ones out. We have many murderers, many very bad people in our [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=17.32s)]
*  country that they've allowed because of a ridiculous, actually stupid open border policy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=24.36s)]
*  Nine hundred and fifty six. That's the number of illegals, most with criminal records, who were deported by ICE just yesterday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=30.64s)]
*  In total, there have been two thousand three hundred and seventy arrests of border crashers since January twenty third. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=38.64s)]
*  That's about an average of five hundred ninety two a day. These were child molesters. These were gang bangers. These were drug [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=45.56s)]
*  human traffickers and domestic abusers. Yeah, there were rapists, too. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=53.72s)]
*  Meet Edgar de la Cruz Monzo, convicted child rapist and Mexican national arrested by ICE in Seattle on Saturday. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=60.04s)]
*  And there are just cold blooded killers in the bunch, too, like Cesar Augusto Polanco, who hails from the Dominican Republic and was [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=68.64s)]
*  just picked up in Boston a few days ago. Now, seeing the deportation deportation flights begin, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=76.28s)]
*  the troops on the border, the no nonsense Tom Holman doing what he does best, enforcing the law, protecting the homeland. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  This is all extremely positive. It has a phenomenal deterrent effect at anyone thinking of coming here at this point. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  Now, one would think that keeping vicious criminals off the streets would be uncontroversial. How's that controversial? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  But singer, actress and skincare entrepreneur Selena Gomez, she's very upset. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=108.2s)]
*  Just want to say that I'm so sorry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=114.28s)]
*  All my people are getting attacked. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  The children. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=123.0s)]
*  They don't understand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=128.08s)]
*  They're so sorry. I wish I could do something that I can. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=130.88s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=135.32s)]
*  I'll try everything I can. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=138.56s)]
*  Well, she's really crying there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=143.56s)]
*  Well, she tried until the fierce online backlash and then Gomez deleted that insipid, weepy post. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=144.96s)]
*  Notice she said my people are getting attacked. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=153.24s)]
*  What my people? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=155.32s)]
*  Is she an illegal alien committing crimes? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=156.8s)]
*  That's not those aren't her people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=159.24s)]
*  Now, given that she's worth an estimated one point three billion dollars, good for her, according to Bloomberg, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=161.12s)]
*  I imagine Selena Gomez could establish homes for migrants in their home countries where they're actually citizens. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=167.04s)]
*  But no, she apparently thinks that working people should be punished by having these illegals flood their communities. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=174.24s)]
*  And speaking of billionaires and even worse than Gomez, caring about the state, not caring about the safety of the American people, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=181.56s)]
*  is a governor not caring about the safety of the American people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=188.36s)]
*  Enter shameless deceiver Illinois's J.B. Pritzker. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=193.04s)]
*  They're going after people who are law abiding, who are holding down jobs. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=197.6s)]
*  Why are we going after them? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=201.76s)]
*  These are not people who are causing problems in our country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=203.12s)]
*  And what we need is a path to citizenship for them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=205.6s)]
*  We also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Did he say protect people? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=216.88s)]
*  What a farce. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=219.0s)]
*  Chicago is already reeling from gangbanger crime. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  They don't need any more problems. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=223.84s)]
*  And raise your hand if you're tired of these rich politicians and CEOs and celebrities trotting out their immigration sob stories. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  I used to do this on my radio show years ago with complete with music. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  But every time enforcement is actually carried out or ramped up, it's always the valedictorian. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=237.84s)]
*  It's always it's the same thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=244.8s)]
*  But first of all, if you're in the country illegally, and especially if you're a criminal, you are a deportable alien under U.S. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=247.44s)]
*  law. And yes, the term alien is correct. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=256.68s)]
*  Others here on phony claims of asylum, they are deportable as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=259.92s)]
*  But just because wealthy Americans like cheap labor, that doesn't change what's true. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=265.36s)]
*  Now, Trump won. And he said this tonight when he was in Florida giving that speech to the Republicans. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=271.88s)]
*  He won in large part because of his pledge to deport millions of illegals. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=276.76s)]
*  And I mean, millions, not thousands, millions. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=280.8s)]
*  The explosion of the illegal population coast to coast has had hideously destructive effects on local communities, on their schools, on their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=284.28s)]
*  health care budgets and of course, the crime, including against children, as we've seen with recent horrors in Boston, where local [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=293.12s)]
*  authorities had released this freak into the community. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  And there are tens of thousands of other violent illegal alien criminals still loose across America. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=306.12s)]
*  And as far as the argument that garden variety, illegal immigration is a victimless crime, you know, I say to that bowl [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=313.0s)]
*  working families, first time job seekers, as usual, they suffer the most and also kids in school, schools that are overloaded with [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=320.32s)]
*  ESL students. Budgets are crunched. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course, wealthy Democrats, though, like J.B., like Gavin Newsom with their multiple homes and their private jets. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  They float above the misery they're willing to inflict on you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=341.04s)]
*  But they ought to be very careful here because interfering with a federal law enforcement operation is a crime. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=344.84s)]
*  Listen closely to his state AG, who parses his words very carefully. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  I have no intent on interfering with legal immigration enforcement processes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=358.84s)]
*  The state of Illinois is that we have a trust act that says that local and state law enforcement resources cannot be used for such [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=365.36s)]
*  unless there's a federal criminal warrant. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=373.32s)]
*  I'm going to stand by our constitution. I'm going to stand by our state law. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=375.36s)]
*  What the Open Borders Uniparty did to America is, I'm sorry, it's treasonous. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  And until we remove all the threats to the homeland, we should have a pause on all immigration to the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  We must get rid of this backlog. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=395.56s)]
*  It is massive in the tens of millions. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=397.68s)]
*  And a thousand a day is sadly it's just a drop in the bucket. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=401.48s)]
*  We need ten times that number, which is possible if states and local officials actually cooperated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=405.8s)]
*  And you know what happens when America becomes, as Teddy Roosevelt warned all those years ago, a polyglot boarding house? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=413.44s)]
*  Look at what went down in Dallas over the weekend. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=420.8s)]
*  And we need not forget the NGOs and other groups that take in huge amounts of federal money to settle and help process illegal aliens, like the Catholic Charities. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=431.6s)]
*  I'm an attorney at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in the Refugee and Immigration Services Program. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=443.48s)]
*  This is a video about knowing your rights if immigration and customs enforcement approaches you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=449.64000000000004s)]
*  If you are undocumented and immigration officers come to your workplace, be aware of the following. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=456.28s)]
*  First, do not panic and do not run away. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=462.67999999999995s)]
*  If you are questioned, you may tell them you want to remain silent. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=465.44s)]
*  You can refuse to sign any or all paperwork until you've had the opportunity to speak to a lawyer. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=468.84s)]
*  All the money has to be cut off to these groups. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=474.88s)]
*  All of it. This money should be spent on American homeless individuals, drug addicted, vets on the streets, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=476.88s)]
*  the elderly living alone. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=484.28s)]
*  All of this. It's got to stop. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=486.2s)]
*  Now, naturally, CBS yesterday tried to pull the immigration sob story routine on Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=488.6s)]
*  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing immigration and customs enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=495.2s)]
*  Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service at a school? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=507.92s)]
*  As a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement that they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=515.36s)]
*  Let them talk about the children who have been sex trafficked because of the wide open border. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=523.36s)]
*  If you had a violent murderer in a school, of course, I want law enforcement to go and get that person out. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=528.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=533.68s)]
*  What's the point of the question? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=534.16s)]
*  Enough with the immigration sob stories. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=536.2s)]
*  There are just as many American difficulties out there because of the illegal immigrant crush. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  J.D. killed it in that interview. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=544.2800000000001s)]
*  And don't you love how Democrats and their pals in the regime media have suddenly become fiscal hawks when it comes to the cost of deporting all the illegals that their policies allowed in? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  They want to invest billions of dollars in mass deportation, which, by the way, will also drive up costs when we lose hardworking immigrants that have been here for decades, expect prices to go through the roof. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  His plans to deport undocumented migrant workers and put tariffs on imports would likely drive up the cost to build more homes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=570.84s)]
*  These sorts of things are going to cost a lot of money. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  You're going to need a lot of money to fund what he wants to do at the border, how he wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=580.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Now they want to cut costs. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=587.48s)]
*  Where were they four years ago? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=589.92s)]
*  Now, Tom Homan has the best response to all of this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=592.6s)]
*  There's consequences to entering a country illegally. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=597.68s)]
*  If we don't show those consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=600.24s)]
*  Congress has a mandate to give us money we need. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=603.36s)]
*  What price do you put on national security? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=605.84s)]

*  You know what they're not safe. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1936.36s)]
*  They're not safe now. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1937.24s)]
*  It was it was a thing of beauty but he didn't stop there. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  There will be more fires until we include in any disaster relief items which will [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1948.36s)]
*  prevent it or at least mitigate it from happening again. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1955.64s)]
*  So you're going to see us proposing both of those like like water. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1958.88s)]
*  You know the party of common sense. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1966.6000000000001s)]
*  We're the bread with a party of common sense. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1968.24s)]
*  You're not in all fairness. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1970.4s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1972.6000000000001s)]
*  We like water to put out fires. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1972.92s)]
*  It's really quite efficient. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1974.48s)]
*  Certainly is. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1980.1200000000001s)]
*  But Trump didn't do that alone. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1981.0800000000002s)]
*  You were right there with him. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1983.8400000000001s)]
*  It was your influence. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1985.24s)]
*  And what you just saw there was a man in his element like Tom Brady at QB George Patton [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1986.92s)]
*  and war or Joy Behar at SeaWorld. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1993.0s)]
*  I haven't seen someone get this dressed down since kill me and wear a halter top to an [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=1998.64s)]
*  inaugural ball. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2003.0s)]
*  You got to wonder how many blue Californians just turned a little bit red and not by [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2007.2s)]
*  embarrassment but by the realization that this guy follows through. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2012.12s)]
*  And for you that's not a product of affluence but influence. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2016.4799999999998s)]
*  Trump listened to those on the ground. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2020.2399999999998s)]
*  In fact he sought them out directly and then in front of everyone delivered their message [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2022.36s)]
*  to the party that demanded a separation from the minions that they claimed falsely to [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2027.0s)]
*  represent. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2032.12s)]
*  Remember this. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2033.2399999999998s)]
*  When Trump is in the room so are you. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2034.76s)]
*  Have you ever felt that before. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2038.1999999999998s)]
*  He's saying what you're thinking. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2040.3200000000002s)]
*  Like right now he'd say man that Greg Gutfeld could probably bench press twice his own [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2042.3600000000001s)]
*  weight. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2047.2s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2049.48s)]
*  He's right. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2050.8s)]
*  But it was your fearless enthusiasm and your willingness to share the risk that pulled [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2052.6s)]
*  Trump way past the finish line. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2058.0s)]
*  So much so that his leadership is now considered not a mere win but a mandate. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2060.36s)]
*  And now he's opened up the government for you to walk right in unannounced to see the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2066.04s)]
*  charlatans at work. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2070.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like walking in on four guys squatting in your house. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2072.12s)]
*  Trump's purpose is just that to reintroduce you to the government that failed you and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  to remind these crooks no actually order them to do the common sense work we expect from [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  them and if they don't they will either be gone or exposed or both. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2086.12s)]
*  No wonder Newsom came to Trump's plane fidgeting and nervous. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2090.3599999999997s)]
*  He was looking like a kid waiting for dad to return from a business trip. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2094.52s)]
*  Look it wasn't about California it was about his comeuppance. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2101.1600000000003s)]
*  What did he do while Trump was gone. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2105.4s)]
*  Trump was coming to town whether you liked it or not. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2109.2400000000002s)]
*  Hiding from such a reckoning would only be a reminder to every one of your cowardice. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2112.2000000000003s)]
*  So this hit the ground running success and the clarity of Trump's effectiveness came [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2117.1600000000003s)]
*  from one thing not affluence influence yours. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2121.44s)]
*  So pat yourself on the back because no one else in the media is going to do it for you. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2126.64s)]
*  Well they might but when they do they'll be holding a knife in their hand. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's welcome Ted Arzges. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2135.88s)]
*  Lesbians accuse him of cultural appropriation. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2140.08s)]
*  Comedian Joe Mackey. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2144.6800000000003s)]
*  Even she can't spell her last name financial analyst Heather Zubarak. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2147.12s)]
*  Here's a die that the FDA should really ban comedian Jeff Dye. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2155.7999999999997s)]
*  And she's fun loving with a bun in the oven New York Times. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2163.16s)]
*  Best of luck out there. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2166.72s)]
*  Joe great seeing you although you do look like the guy who sold me cocaine in the 90s. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2176.7999999999997s)]
*  The club just sitting there and it wasn't very good cocaine Joe. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2184.2799999999997s)]
*  So how did you feel when you watched Trump kind of dress down these incompetence these [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2187.72s)]
*  bureaucrats. Did you get a get a fire in your belly. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2193.52s)]
*  It felt really good Greg because not only did they screw up almost everything imaginable [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2197.24s)]
*  through the not having force management not having water in the reservoir that fed the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2203.76s)]
*  hydrants but then they go and take away your freedom in the name of safety. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2207.52s)]
*  It's the same thing they do in every disaster. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2211.92s)]
*  I'm in charge of my own safety. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2214.6s)]
*  That's why I got rid of my trampoline and I quit cheerleading. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2216.8s)]
*  Good for you. I understand. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  I understand why Trump wants to have some strings attached to this funding because they [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2223.56s)]
*  screwed almost everything up so far. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2228.28s)]
*  The only thing they've done right is try to get a lot of lesbians on the team. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2230.64s)]
*  I think that was a good move. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2235.44s)]
*  I just wonder how it came up in the firefighter job interview. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2236.48s)]
*  You know like I've been to a lot of job interviews and no one ever asks me if I'm a lesbian. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2239.96s)]
*  The only time people ask me if I'm a lesbian is on the comments section of Gutfeld posts. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2248.44s)]
*  What about a lesbian bar. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2255.04s)]
*  It must have been a weird process. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2258.2s)]
*  You know they're like OK now we're going to see if you can climb this ladder in full gear and then we're going to watch you throw a softball. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2259.88s)]
*  Well put Joe. Well put. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2275.52s)]
*  Heather you come from a financial background or so you claim. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2279.08s)]
*  We've seen no proof of this. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2282.6000000000004s)]
*  Do you get the sense. Well you. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2285.28s)]
*  I use the phrase from the economic world animal spirits. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2286.6000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of like it feels like an emotional optimism that now we have decided this is what we want. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2289.76s)]
*  And once you decide you actually do it and Trump is there. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2296.0400000000004s)]
*  The point on that spear that we want water and we need water to fight fires. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2299.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean he kept saying we like water. Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2304.5600000000004s)]
*  Like what. It's like wow. That's such a common sense approach signing an executive order to open the valves turn on the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2307.0800000000004s)]
*  valves get the water flowing. They have an abundance of water supply but instead they have decided to save a little tiny fish [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2315.12s)]
*  called the smelt fish which by the way is not an actual endangered species. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2322.96s)]
*  There are other areas of the world. So instead we've decided on human sacrifice. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2327.56s)]
*  So I do agree with a lot of what Joe said not all of the lesbian stuff but the other part about what do you have against lesbians. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2332.72s)]
*  Nothing besides other lesbians. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2341.52s)]
*  I. Joe made a point about saying like this never happens in the box business. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2345.08s)]
*  Marty does not ask me about. So I'm sorry. Joe mentioned safety and he was mentioning if this is my house you should let me go back [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2356.48s)]
*  and get my belongings not in one week. The looters aren't going to wait one week to rob and steal the stuff in your house. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2366.56s)]
*  And so Trump is saying hey I'm going to side with the residents and you should be able to go back to your house. And it's all [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  about the government exercising too much control. Yeah. I mean whether you're a lesbian or not. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2379.6s)]
*  It's so funny because when she said it could be a week everybody at home goes that's too long. And that just came flying out. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2385.2799999999997s)]
*  That's too long. You know Jeff you live in L.A. I'm glad to see that you were able to rescue your grandparents sweater. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2393.9199999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2401.12s)]
*  To herald die. Yeah you let you let this was his. It was amazing how you took it off him and he wasn't even on fire. He was [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2404.0s)]
*  it was just time. It was his time. I'm curious about you know you live in L.A. You have obviously friends who probably aren't [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2412.08s)]
*  Trumpies or whatever. How are they dealing with this. Everyone's upset. The only good thing that's going to come from this is [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2420.88s)]
*  people are going to start becoming Republican. Yeah. Because they're going to realize it took what over 50 years to build the [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2428.36s)]
*  palisades. And now it's going to take 60 70 more years to do it again. Like she says she has a three point safety plan. Right. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2434.02s)]
*  It's got to be safe before you go in. First for the looters. Second for the arsonists. Third for the inspectors to give you a [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2441.8s)]
*  big fee and say when you're allowed to come back. And I stand by that. I think that's really smart. Yeah. She's a smart lady. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2451.7200000000003s)]
*  What do you love. Were you near the fires at all. Yeah. I had to evacuate. It was terrible. Really. Sherman Oaks. Oh the fire [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2458.88s)]
*  shouldn't get that far. No they should not. Well pissed off. It's hard to make it funny. Like I'm like really upset about it. She [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2464.1600000000003s)]
*  sucks and I'm glad Trump put her in her place. They even took her microphone away which I like. That was hilarious. She saw. They [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2469.6400000000003s)]
*  all saw. Yeah. And news. We can't trust him with money. Like you said. I mean they say like all the liberals go trust your [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2476.0s)]
*  government. Don't even question it. Don't even question it. It's a blast for me to question your government. The dude Gavin [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2482.72s)]
*  Newscomb lost twenty three billion dollars that was supposed to go to homeless people. Yeah. When I was like short on my till [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2488.9199999999996s)]
*  waiting tables like they would be like hey you're 40 bucks short. Twenty three billion. Yeah. Where the hell does that go. It's [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyIXS-tN3_U&t=2496.68s)]
