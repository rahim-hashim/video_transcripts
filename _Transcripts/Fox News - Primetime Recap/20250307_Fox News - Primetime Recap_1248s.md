*  You guys can get a better car. If you can afford that car... [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=45.18s)]

*  Police also allege that on a separate occasion, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=85.16s)]

*  The left used to care about mass shootings, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=91.44s)]
*  but when a they-them is pulling the trigger, crickets. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=93.24000000000001s)]

*  Quote, two weeks ago, I was called a Nazi [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  in the parking lot at Kroger. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  I came home and I told my husband, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  that's it, I'm done. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=129.74s)]
*  Another owner is so ashamed, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=132.04s)]

*  I bought this before Elon went crazy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=141.86s)]

*  are changing their car's logos to avoid being targeted. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=146.96s)]
*  This has become a dangerous and pretty disturbing trend [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=151.16s)]
*  that's now, I guess, not showing any signs of slowing down. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=153.84s)]
*  Why won't the Democrats denounce their base? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=158.3s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers posting the same exact video [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=162.44s)]
*  with the same exact weird script, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=165.62s)]

*  holding a microphone the exact same way, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=170.12s)]
*  and it gets worse. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=173.06s)]
*  And Democrats aren't posting cringeworthy videos. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  Many turn into agents of chaos [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=177.48s)]
*  with public stunts, performative outrage. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=180.08s)]
*  Today, Congressman Al Green was officially censored [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=182.62s)]
*  for his disgraceful conduct [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=185.62s)]
*  during the president's joint address to Congress. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=187.86s)]
*  Green's behavior was also shameful and bizarre. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=190.32s)]
*  The ten Democrats actually broke party ranks [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=193.5s)]
*  to censor their colleague. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=196.0s)]
*  Now, that's a big deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=198.7s)]
*  But that didn't stop Green or the Democrats. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=200.5s)]
*  They started singing, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  We Shall Overcome on the House floor today, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=204.58s)]
*  following the vote. Take a look. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  Representative Al Green be censored [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=210.12s)]
*  with public reading of this resolution by the speaker. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=213.06s)]
*  -♪ I'll pray for you, oh, deep in my heart... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=216.3s)]
*  I'll pray for you... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=225.58s)]
*  I'll pray for you... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=228.08s)]
*  The House had come to order. The House had come to order. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=231.08s)]
*  Well, the Congressional Tabernacle Chorus. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Green wasn't the only [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  disrupted Democrat during Donald Trump's state, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=240.06s)]
*  well, his joint address before Congress. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  There were pointless walkouts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=245.7s)]
*  There were weird paddles with different messages, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=247.6s)]
*  handwritten signs, plenty of outbursts. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=250.24s)]
*  I love the bingo paddles. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=252.94s)]
*  Anyway, never mind that they wouldn't stand [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=254.24s)]
*  for the president or the first lady. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=256.44s)]
*  They couldn't even bring themselves [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=258.18s)]
*  to stand for a brave kid with cancer, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=259.58s)]
*  the families of murder victims, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=262.32s)]
*  or a future West Point cadet, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=264.32s)]
*  or the young wife of a police officer that was murdered. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=266.88s)]
*  This was a reprehensible display of indignation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=270.36s)]
*  Well, the only Democrat I saw that even tried to condemn it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=273.68s)]
*  was John Fetterman, Senator of Pennsylvania, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=276.76s)]
*  one of the only Democrats now criticizing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=279.32s)]
*  his party's behavior. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=281.52s)]
*  On X, he called it out, said, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=283.06s)]
*  a sad cavalcade of self-owns and unhinged petulance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=285.0s)]
*  It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=290.44s)]
*  We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=294.2s)]
*  that nobody pays attention to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=297.44s)]
*  And right on cue, another car alarm. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  This time, from our favorite congresswoman, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett, who is now accusing Republicans [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=303.9s)]
*  of racism. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=306.8s)]
*  I worked so well during the campaign. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=308.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=310.14s)]
*  As they have decided to go after immigrants, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=311.64s)]
*  and these and things like that, and they've said, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  oh, they're taking your black jobs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=316.38s)]
*  They're taking your black jobs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=318.78s)]
*  Not really. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=321.36s)]
*  They are obviously jobs that they want us to go back to, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  such as work in the fields, all right? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  Those immigrants that come into our country, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=328.12s)]
*  they work the fields, something that we ain't done [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=330.12s)]
*  in a long time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=332.42s)]
*  And clearly, he is trying to make us go back to the fields. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are watching [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=338.56s)]
*  too much MSDNC. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=341.40000000000003s)]

*  Rachel Maddow, the chief conspiracy theorist, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=361.26s)]
*  and Nicole Wallace. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=364.2s)]
*  What a sad decline she has had. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=365.4s)]
*  Politicized, chided the 13-year-old cancer survivor [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=367.09999999999997s)]

*  His father has now responded. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=374.32s)]
*  I hope you people over at MSDNC pay attention. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=376.62s)]
*  Rachel Maddow needs to shut her mouth [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=380.12s)]
*  if she has nothing nice to say. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=383.62s)]
*  She does not need to put her bad energy on us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=386.44s)]
*  Why attack a 13-year-old kid? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  Why wouldn't Democrats stand for that? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=394.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't they celebrate that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  Why wouldn't they stand for mothers [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=398.12s)]
*  that lost their children? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=399.72s)]
*  What does that say about this party today [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=401.06s)]
*  and their friends in the state-run legacy media mob [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=403.5s)]

*  as it played out on November 5th. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=411.64s)]
*  At Dow today, even President Trump [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=414.29999999999995s)]
*  responded to this sick, disgusting display. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=415.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=418.34s)]
*  Frankly, what Nicole Wallace said, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=419.84s)]
*  I've never been a fan of hers, and she's not very talented. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=423.64s)]
*  But I'll tell you what she said the other day [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=428.38s)]
*  about that young man is disgraceful. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=430.17999999999995s)]
*  She should be forced to resign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=432.88s)]
*  And Rachel Maddow should be forced to resign. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody watches her anyway. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=438.02s)]
*  I don't know if it's not possible they pay her [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  as much attention. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=441.5s)]
*  It's not possible they pay her as much money as I hear. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=442.62s)]
*  But certainly, she's lost all credibility, both of them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=445.56s)]
*  But what they said the other day, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  they should be forced to resign about that young person who [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  is suffering greatly. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=455.86s)]
*  Now, if they fired Joy Reid, why are these two people still [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=458.26000000000005s)]
*  there? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=461.94s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=462.70000000000005s)]
*  Rachel Maddow suggested racism may be involved. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=464.04s)]
*  Maybe that's something that NBC needs to look into. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  The media mob, state-run as it is, and the Democratic Party, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=470.62s)]
*  they have reached a new low. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=473.68s)]
*  They are in a massive hole, but they can't stop digging. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  The narcissism, the rage has completely taken over. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=478.58s)]
*  And the American people, they have taken notice. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  In fact, a brand new internal poll shared with Politico [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=484.12s)]
*  shows the vast majority of voters [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=487.12s)]
*  think the Democratic Party has lost its way. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=489.46s)]
*  Well, who thinks they're on the right track? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=492.42s)]
*  Just 10% think the party has a good strategy for the future. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=494.7s)]
*  I don't know who they are. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=498.56s)]
*  But at least a few Dems have learned something [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  from the past 10 years, besides how to be a drag queen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=501.62s)]
*  Last month, a centrist leaning Democratic think tank [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=505.06s)]
*  held a retreat to figure out how to make normal people vote [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=508.44s)]
*  Democrat again. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=511.8s)]
*  Their mission statement, quote, activist groups [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=513.64s)]
*  and progressive staffers push unpopular cultural positions, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  making it seem like Dems are more extreme [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=520.48s)]
*  than they actually are. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=522.62s)]
*  Activist groups promote their single issue [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=525.48s)]
*  and raise money around it not to make Democrats electable. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=527.38s)]
*  So, wait, you mean castrating little boys isn't popular? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=531.78s)]
*  And that it's not cool to watch men beat up girls in sports, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=536.02s)]
*  sometimes sending them to the hospital? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=538.72s)]
*  Or that Americans don't want to bring in millions of illegals [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=540.72s)]
*  and make excuses for the ones who kill people? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, dip me in dog-sh-t and call me a fudgicle. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=546.66s)]
*  Seriously, that turns me on. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=549.44s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for connecting those dots for us, Matlock. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=556.0s)]
*  Now they offer Dems advice. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=559.26s)]
*  Stop focusing on oppression politics [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=561.16s)]
*  without acknowledging the country's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=563.9s)]
*  progress and potential. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  It's true. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  That's like a guy dating a supermodel who's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=568.68s)]
*  also smart and funny, but he keeps [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=570.5799999999999s)]
*  complaining that she's Irish. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=572.28s)]
*  They say to embrace patriotism, community, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=585.76s)]
*  and traditional American imagery. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  Great, but I think that guy is already taken. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  Avoid overly moralistic or condescending messaging. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=600.4s)]
*  Speak plainly and directly. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  In other words, watch CNN and then do the opposite. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  And own the failures of democratic governance [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=610.38s)]
*  in large cities. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=612.62s)]
*  Translation, Democrats start being Republicans. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=614.06s)]
*  Now you could say, well, better late than never. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=618.4s)]
*  But they could have saved this country a whole lot of pain [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=620.96s)]
*  and suffering if they did this sooner, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=623.06s)]
*  like when they first realized Joe had [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=625.4s)]
*  the brain of a snapping turtle. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=627.3s)]
*  And who wouldn't want to be a Republican right now? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=630.4s)]
*  It's like finding out you're pregnant and this is the dad. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=633.54s)]
*  According to a CBS News survey, 76% of viewers [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=636.18s)]
*  approved of Trump's speech. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=639.42s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=640.9799999999999s)]
*  That poll's right up there with my abs and kittens calendar. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Most people said the speech made them feel hopeful, proud, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  inspiring, and unifying. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=650.92s)]
*  You know, the opposite way you feel when you saw these guys. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  And according to a CNN poll, Trump's [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  And according to a CNN poll, that's right, CNN, 69% [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=661.7s)]
*  had a positive reaction. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=665.24s)]
*  69%. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=666.94s)]
*  Even Rachel Maddow thinks that's a good number. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=667.94s)]
*  No wonder all the sane Dems are depressed. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=677.1400000000001s)]
*  John Fetterman summed the Dems' behavior up on Tuesday [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=680.32s)]
*  as, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=683.72s)]
*  Yeah, and this is the guy who would wear sweats [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=691.7s)]
*  and a hoodie to a funeral. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  Bottom line, Trump Derangement Syndrome [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=697.0s)]
*  became Trump Derangement Strategy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=699.1400000000001s)]
*  And by taking over the party, it forced [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=701.84s)]
*  them to come out against everything Trump was for, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=703.48s)]
*  which as it turned out was everything [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=706.38s)]
*  the American public was for. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=708.0200000000001s)]
*  So it left them with nothing but hate. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=710.32s)]
*  So I do wish the Dems luck who are trying to rid themselves [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=712.7800000000001s)]
*  of the craziest, angriest people in their party. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=715.72s)]
*  But if you listened to me three years ago, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  and not the weepy Jimmy Kimmels of the world, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=719.9799999999999s)]
*  you wouldn't be in this mess. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=722.36s)]
*  You're a brain dead party, which serves your right [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=724.4599999999999s)]

*  Oh, so the Kennedy Saves the World podcast. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=756.08s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=758.38s)]
*  And she's a comedian, too. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=759.38s)]
*  And she's a comedian, too. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=761.38s)]

*  And she's a comedian, too. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=769.36s)]
*  And the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=771.28s)]
*  Whoo! [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=773.88s)]
*  Whoo! [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=774.98s)]
*  Jamie, you know what sucks, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=778.52s)]
*  and I'm not gonna say your comedy routine, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=780.72s)]
*  because that's too obvious. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=782.8s)]
*  It's the fact that it takes Democrats [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=784.36s)]
*  to find out it's unpopular [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=786.5s)]
*  in order to actually change things. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=789.0s)]
*  Now they... now they're making, oh, my God, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=791.0s)]
*  maybe we shouldn't be for surgically enhancing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=792.9s)]
*  children's genitals. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=795.24s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like they change [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=796.8s)]
*  based on what they think people want them to think. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=798.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like, they're making true ideas. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=801.14s)]
*  And watching the Trump speech, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=802.72s)]
*  which I was one of the 69% that absolutely approved, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=804.16s)]
*  I thought it was a great speech, it was entertaining, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=806.46s)]
*  I find it just immature that they sit down, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=808.46s)]
*  they sit on one side, well, the other side cheers and claps, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=811.6s)]
*  even when a little boy survives cancer. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=813.9399999999999s)]
*  Like, even at that moment, you would think they would grow. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=816.68s)]
*  That... Watching the video of the speech, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=818.88s)]
*  it reminded me of a lot of my shows, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=820.9399999999999s)]
*  except for the half that stood up and clapped. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=823.08s)]
*  And, um... [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=825.38s)]
*  But I think... I think in some ways, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=827.18s)]
*  you know, I'm the divorce guy, I think in some ways, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=829.16s)]
*  I'm like the Democrats' ex-wife. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=830.96s)]
*  But guess what? We have children together, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=833.1800000000001s)]
*  and that's the United States of America. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=835.38s)]
*  And you have to put your ego aside, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=837.1800000000001s)]
*  and you have to care about... Like, I have an ex-wife, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=839.12s)]
*  but because we have kids, you have to learn to co-parent. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=841.4200000000001s)]
*  Like, I still... She actually texted me [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=843.76s)]
*  right before the show. I'm not even kidding. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=845.72s)]
*  It says, uh, "'Fuck you.'" [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=847.22s)]
*  It's, um... [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=848.86s)]
*  It's... [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=850.26s)]
*  It's... [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=851.76s)]
*  It's... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=853.3000000000001s)]
*  It's... [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  We still communicate just like we did [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=857.14s)]
*  when we were together. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=858.84s)]
*  That's a beautiful, beautiful story, Jamie. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=861.62s)]
*  Heather, I'm trying to figure out, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=864.66s)]
*  do the Dems have an identity [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=866.8s)]
*  if everything was in this, uh, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=868.96s)]
*  like Trump derangement basket? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  And now that you find out that Trump is popular, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=873.2s)]
*  the derangement can't work. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=875.6s)]
*  But they didn't have a backup plan. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=877.54s)]
*  What say you? Zoom-a-laka! [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=879.08s)]
*  They don't have a backup plan. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=881.0s)]
*  And, Jamie, you can get one of those black signs [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=882.88s)]
*  that they're holding up when you want the audience to clap. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=885.44s)]
*  It's pretty effective. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=888.38s)]
*  Um, at least on this show, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=889.68s)]
*  but not so much in Congress, right? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=891.56s)]
*  Uh... [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=893.8199999999999s)]
*  Uh... [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  He... [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=897.0s)]
*  He really didn't say anything [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=898.6999999999999s)]
*  that people could disagree with. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=901.3s)]
*  And so that was a problem where you see people on CNN [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=903.3s)]
*  and even MSNBC saying, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=906.7399999999999s)]
*  oh, he has a great approval rating. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=908.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, closing our border, approved. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=911.18s)]
*  Balance the budget. Yes, we approve. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  Keeping women out of boys sports. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  Uh, men, I should say. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=918.8199999999999s)]
*  And boys sports. Of course we approve of that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=920.86s)]
*  I mean, he had a few digs at Biden, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=923.4599999999999s)]
*  but overall, to Trump's point, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=925.76s)]
*  I mean, the guy could cure cancer, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=928.1s)]
*  or he could solve everlasting peace in the world, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=929.6999999999999s)]
*  and the Democrats would not care at this point today. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=933.0s)]
*  Mm, good point. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=936.54s)]
*  You know, uh, Jim, I met your son in the green room. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=938.24s)]
*  It's good to see that he's not as... [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=940.78s)]
*  He's older than the women you date. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=942.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, no, he's actually two years younger. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=947.52s)]
*  He's 14, yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=950.78s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=953.72s)]
*  Um, how are you enjoying this, uh, this... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=955.32s)]
*  I haven't talked to you since Trump, uh, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=958.12s)]
*  since Trump got into office. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=960.1s)]
*  How's it going for you? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=962.16s)]
*  Oh, it's going great. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=963.74s)]
*  All the comedians in New York City are miserable. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=965.74s)]
*  They're all going on stage. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=968.34s)]
*  They're trying to talk about Trump, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=969.44s)]
*  but the crowd doesn't want to hear it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=970.54s)]
*  Like, even the young crowd, like the young New Yorkers, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=972.34s)]
*  like, please, I don't want to hear it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=974.24s)]
*  They're not even booed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=975.68s)]
*  If someone goes, who voted for Trump? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=977.24s)]
*  Ten people raised their hand. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=978.78s)]
*  They don't even get booed or anything like that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes! [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=981.52s)]
*  It's, they're all miserable. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=982.52s)]
*  The crowd's not like, hey, come on, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=983.62s)]
*  let's just have some laughs, which is good. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=984.62s)]
*  I haven't seen that yet, but I love what happened. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=985.92s)]
*  This is a long speech. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=989.16s)]
*  This is the longest speech ever he did. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=990.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=991.66s)]
*  You know, I think he's competitive, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=992.66s)]
*  so he saw, like, Adrian Brody at the Oscars. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=993.66s)]
*  He had the longest speech, so Trump's like, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=996.16s)]
*  watch what I do on Tuesday. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=997.66s)]
*  The only one that was probably mad was Elon. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=999.16s)]
*  He's like, come on, I got to get out of here. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1003.7s)]
*  I got to pregnant another woman. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1005.06s)]
*  Kill him. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1006.36s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1007.16s)]
*  It is funny, though, when you think about, like, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1007.96s)]
*  the desperate desire for those Democrats [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1011.74s)]
*  to appeal to the youth vote by doing [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1014.7s)]
*  that little video game dance. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1016.88s)]
*  But young people very easily are just, like, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1018.88s)]
*  drawn to Trump, because he just pisses those people off. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1021.48s)]
*  He's like, the kids' teachers hate Trump. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1025.38s)]
*  So you got to love Trump. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1029.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1031.56s)]
*  All my kids' teachers hate Trump, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  so they all do the opposite, of course. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1035.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1037.08s)]
*  And these young kids like it, because he's a ball buster. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1038.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1039.9799999999998s)]
*  And he makes fun of it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1040.78s)]
*  And this generation loves that stuff, which is great. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  It was like a comedy club, that whole speech. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1044.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1045.9599999999998s)]
*  It was heckling, yelling, people getting thrown out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1048.62s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1050.4599999999998s)]
*  He's playing on one side of the room. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1051.26s)]
*  Like, I always do that before I go on stage. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1053.04s)]
*  I said at a comedian before, how's the crowd? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1054.76s)]
*  He's like, this side's pretty good, but this one's not. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1056.6s)]
*  So Trump got to go, like, the left side's great. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1058.8999999999999s)]
*  This side sucks. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1061.8s)]
*  There's always one old guy that just wanders around, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1063.8999999999999s)]
*  doesn't know where he is. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1066.2s)]
*  No, they ain't the soup kitchen. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1067.68s)]
*  Kennedy, what did you make of those Democrats [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1069.1399999999999s)]
*  doing the Choose Your Fighter video? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1072.22s)]
*  I thought it was so stupid. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1074.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1076.12s)]
*  You know, it's like, they are trying to focus group this [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1077.32s)]
*  stuff, and that's the opposite of leading. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1079.36s)]
*  Like, they're following whatever conservatives are [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1081.56s)]
*  doing right now, and they're so far in front, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1084.6s)]
*  because they're forecasting what problems might be [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1087.46s)]
*  coming up down the road, and Democrats are chasing [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1091.04s)]
*  Republicans' tails right now. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1094.82s)]
*  And it's so disingenuous. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1097.02s)]
*  It's so incredibly pointless. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1098.96s)]
*  And they're like, they're spitballing anything. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1100.56s)]
*  Like, let's try, can we try patriotism? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1102.5s)]
*  And it's like, no, you were the guys, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1105.1000000000001s)]
*  you sided with Colin Kaepernick when he started [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1107.1000000000001s)]
*  kneeling for the national anthem. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1109.8s)]
*  Like, that's what your party was doing. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's like the dean at Barnard College. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1113.3s)]
*  You know, right now, they have a bunch of anti-Israel, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1117.04s)]
*  anti-Semitic protesters that are super pro-Hamas, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1119.72s)]
*  and the dean is just trying to pacify them. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1123.3000000000002s)]
*  And that's what Democrats did with progressives [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1126.3000000000002s)]
*  for the last eight years. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1129.0s)]
*  And this is what you get. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1131.24s)]
*  You get Trump again after you tried to E. Gene Carroll him, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1133.14s)]
*  after you tried to judge Marshawn him, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1137.68s)]
*  after you tried to Fannie Willis him. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1140.42s)]
*  Like, all of, none of it worked. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1142.8600000000001s)]
*  And he gets to be president again, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1145.0800000000002s)]
*  and now you're doing a weak impression of him [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1146.8200000000002s)]
*  because your fighting skills are lackluster, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1149.1s)]
*  and Napoleon Dynamite would barf all over you [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1152.48s)]
*  with embarrassment. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1154.68s)]
*  That is true. You know. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1155.78s)]
*  You know. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1157.12s)]
*  I am wondering, do you have a massive hickey on your neck? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1158.22s)]
*  No, I've got whiplash. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1167.32s)]
*  This is actually a cervical collar. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1169.9s)]
*  Is it a cervical collar? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1171.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1173.3s)]
*  It makes your head so tiny. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1174.3s)]
*  I actually have a really large head, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1177.6599999999999s)]
*  so I'm trying to overcompensate. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1179.2199999999998s)]
*  You're like, you know what you remind me of? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1180.6599999999999s)]
*  You remind me, like, of a container [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1181.9599999999998s)]
*  of, like, a dishwasher soap. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1184.4199999999998s)]
*  Because I smell so good and I clean your dishes? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1188.3s)]
*  No, I just want to pop your head off, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1192.04s)]
*  squirt you on my plate. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1193.86s)]
*  I just want to pop your head off [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1196.0s)]
*  and squirt you on my plate, lady. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1197.1799999999998s)]
*  Slow down, Jeffrey Dahmer. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1198.84s)]
*  The sequel is not coming out anytime soon on Netflix. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1200.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, that is the biggest turtleneck I've ever seen. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1204.8999999999999s)]
*  It's McQueen, darling. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1208.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1210.08s)]
*  Is that in style? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, it was expensive, so. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1212.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1213.58s)]
*  Can you imagine Dana in that? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  She'd be like, you wouldn't even see her. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1219.62s)]
*  She'd be like, all right, I should shoot. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1222.1599999999999s)]
*  She's in here, wait, hold on. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRvtodWR08&t=1223.72s)]
