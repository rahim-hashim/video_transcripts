# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 24, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1.6s)]
*  As always, thanks for spending some time with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=4.0s)]
*  12 days to go, can you believe it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=6.76s)]
*  Well, the race is still historically very tight, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=8.72s)]
*  but two new and very big polls [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=11.44s)]
*  now show Trump leading nationally. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=13.68s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has him up by two points, 47 to 45, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=16.32s)]
*  and a new CNBC poll also has him up by two. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=19.92s)]
*  Both are within the margin of error. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=23.16s)]
*  But to capitalize on what they believe is a building wave, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=26.36s)]
*  Trump is everywhere, hitting Nevada and Arizona today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=29.76s)]
*  When we win on November 5th, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  the migrant invasion ends [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=37.6s)]
*  and the restoration of our country begins. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=40.2s)]
*  We're going to restore our country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=43.2s)]
*  And there's a new report of infighting among Kamala's staff [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=47.32s)]
*  after numerous underwhelming performances. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=50.92s)]
*  And of course, it gets even worse for her. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=53.84s)]
*  Kamala's CNN town hall was so bad, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=55.92s)]
*  even the Washington Post panned it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=59.64s)]
*  Tonight, she's in Georgia dragging out old Bruce Springsteen [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=61.84s)]
*  and Barack Obama to beg for votes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=65.32s)]
*  which brings me to Kamala's just a riot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=67.68s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=70.4s)]
*  More than 25 million Americans have already voted, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=74.56s)]
*  and we knew that if things started to look [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=77.84s)]
*  kind of positive for Trump, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=80.68s)]
*  the Harris hit squad would need an October surprise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=82.48s)]
*  But we didn't think it would be October 1943. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess Democrats' fearmongering about abortion [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=90.28s)]
*  wasn't quite getting it done for them, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=92.76s)]
*  so they dropped the F-bomb. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=95.44s)]
*  Yeah, their closing argument [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=97.88s)]
*  is that the man with Jewish grandchildren, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=99.84s)]
*  a Jewish daughter who is a stalwart friend of Israel, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=102.56s)]
*  is a closet fascist who invokes Hitler. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=106.48s)]
*  Who knew Trump was such a talented actor? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=109.6s)]
*  Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=113.08s)]
*  that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=115.96s)]
*  The Jewish state has never had a better friend [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=119.24s)]
*  in the White House than your president, Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=121.6s)]
*  That I can tell you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=126.0s)]
*  After eight long years in which our alliance [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=128.84s)]
*  was undermined and neglected, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=132.08s)]
*  I am happy to report that the United States-Israeli [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=134.56s)]
*  relationship is stronger now than ever before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, in fact, Trump was so pro-Israelist president, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=142.6s)]
*  Pew Research even found that 42% of American Jews [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=145.96s)]
*  thought he favored Israel too much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=150.44s)]
*  So all of this is ludicrous, and it's so low [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=153.04s)]
*  that it almost doesn't even merit a serious response. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=156.72s)]
*  I was thinking of it this way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=160.68s)]
*  If our generals can't recognize the difference [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=162.36s)]
*  between fascism under Hitler [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=165.52s)]
*  and the American populist movement under Trump, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=167.96s)]
*  well, the angle questions was being taught [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=171.04s)]
*  in our military academies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=172.8s)]
*  Of course, this smear was carefully choreographed and timed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=174.8s)]
*  Step one, the New York Times interview with John Kelly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=179.72s)]
*  Step two, get Kelly to drop the F-bomb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=184.04s)]
*  Step three, Anderson Cooper asked Kamala for her reaction. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=188.08s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I do. Yes, I do. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=194.72s)]
*  And I also believe that the people who know him best [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=198.28s)]
*  on this subject should be trusted. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  And step four, the press poodles snap into action [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=204.56s)]
*  as instant validators with somber faces and dire warnings. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump's fascism is the lead story every day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=213.16s)]
*  His cozying up to dictators, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=216.72s)]
*  his obsession with Hitler that has now come out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=220.2s)]
*  I still see this as General Kelly and those other generals, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=223.32s)]
*  they're still protecting America, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=226.76s)]
*  This isn't about partisanship. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=229.2s)]
*  The language, the actions of political rhetoric [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=230.44s)]
*  is 1930s Germany. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  We got to wake up. This is not hyperbole. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=237.16s)]
*  This isn't entertainment value. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=239.48s)]
*  He just said it's like Germany, Hitler's Germany, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=242.2s)]
*  but it's not hyperbole. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=245.16s)]
*  Trump shot all of this down moments ago [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=247.68s)]
*  in an interview with our own Bill Mollusian. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=250.2s)]
*  She did call me a fascist [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=254.32s)]
*  and everyone knows that's not true. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=255.72s)]
*  They call me everything until, you know, something sticks. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=260.28s)]
*  to your former chief of staff, John Kelly, directly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=261.8s)]
*  He said some things about you, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=264.12s)]
*  essentially accusing you of disparaging American soldiers [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=265.32s)]
*  in an Atlantic article. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=268.36s)]
*  When's the last time you talked to him [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=269.84s)]
*  and how would you like to respond? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=271.36s)]
*  Years ago, I fired him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  He was a bully, he was a bad guy, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=276.12s)]
*  and he ended up being a weak guy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  because all bullies end up being weak. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=279.24s)]
*  And he wasn't a smart guy. It's a bad combination. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=282.24s)]
*  But I fired him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=285.08s)]
*  He made a statement that I'm like Hitler. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=287.08s)]
*  It just couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=290.56s)]
*  It's just the opposite, actually. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=293.44s)]
*  Now, think about it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=296.24s)]
*  The Democrats, they're the party that allowed anti-Semitism [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=297.4s)]
*  on college campuses to fester and to grow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=301.44s)]
*  And it's a party where, look, Jewish students [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=305.68s)]
*  didn't feel safe walking to their own dorm rooms. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=308.08s)]
*  And the party's claiming that Trump now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  has a Hitler-esque fascination? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=314.12s)]
*  These people haven't just lost their way. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  They've apparently lost their minds. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=318.6s)]
*  And while it is tempting to just kind of laugh in their faces, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=321.48s)]
*  given the sheer absurdity and the venality of all this, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  there may be something deeper and more sinister [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  to what they're spewing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=330.6s)]
*  Now, while we know that most people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  will tune out these hideous smears, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=334.44000000000005s)]
*  some will believe them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=336.12s)]
*  There are whack jobs out there with hero complexes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  who will listen and believe it is their duty [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=341.88s)]
*  to stop Trump by any means necessary. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=345.68s)]
*  Now, we already had two freaks try to kill Donald Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=349.56s)]
*  in a two-month span. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=353.16s)]
*  Oddly, we still don't know what compelled Thomas Crooks [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=355.24s)]
*  to try to murder Trump and Butler. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=359.44s)]
*  And we still don't really know why Ryan Routh [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  flew across the country to set up his assassination perch [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=364.8s)]
*  in those bushes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=368.52s)]
*  But it is not illogical, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=370.32s)]
*  in the absence of any countervailing facts, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=372.08s)]
*  to assume that they believe what they were hearing, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=374.56s)]
*  what they were seeing, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=378.96s)]
*  and what they were reading about the 45th president. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  And it is not illogical to believe [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  that they decided to take action. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, in the Democrats' desperate desire to hold on to power, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=388.68s)]
*  they risk setting off a chain of events [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  that could end tragically for this country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  But they simply do not care. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=398.52s)]
*  Now, remember, these are the same people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  who were still tying Trump to violence on January 6th. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=403.44s)]
*  Back then, remember, they said, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  and they still say his words mattered, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=408.08s)]
*  challenging the election results. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=410.52s)]
*  He shouldn't have done that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=411.88s)]
*  It stoked the unrest. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=413.2s)]
*  That's their argument. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=414.24s)]
*  Of course, it was ignoring that Trump told his followers [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  to march peacefully. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  They always ignore that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=418.4s)]
*  But what accusation is worse in politics [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=420.28s)]
*  than the Hitler fascist accusation [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=423.96s)]
*  that they're lobbing now? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=426.76s)]
*  So when Kelly, his assessment was agreed to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  by Kamala Harris, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  I thought, why didn't Anderson Cooper follow up with, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  well, madam, if you truly believe that Trump is a fascist [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=438.76s)]
*  who admires Hitler, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=442.0s)]
*  will you accept the results of the election [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=443.28s)]
*  if he should win? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  Or Cooper could have asked, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  some criticize Trump for not attending [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=448.64s)]
*  Biden's inauguration in 2021. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  Will you attend Trump's? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=452.44s)]
*  And madam, wouldn't it be every patriot's duty [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=455.0s)]
*  to try to stop Donald Trump [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=457.64s)]
*  if he really is a fascist? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=460.24s)]
*  But CNN wouldn't ask any of those very logical questions [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  because they don't really believe any of the things [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=466.84s)]
*  that they're saying, none of it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=469.64s)]
*  The truth is they're all out of ideas. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=472.28s)]
*  They're losing and they're flailing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=475.52s)]
*  Between Obama and Biden, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=478.32s)]
*  they've been in charge, what, a total of 12 years? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=479.8s)]
*  And they had a chance to fix Washington, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=482.88s)]
*  to make life better for the working class, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=485.48s)]
*  for minorities, for legal migrants, immigrants, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=488.16s)]
*  but they didn't do any of that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=491.12s)]
*  And after all, after all their time, all their media, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=493.16s)]
*  all their celebrity, their Wall Street support, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=497.04s)]
*  they decide to close out this election with fascism? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=500.0s)]
*  A party confident about its platform, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=506.4s)]
*  really confident about its nominee, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  should be able to proudly defend their record, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=511.28s)]
*  but Democrats cannot. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=514.04s)]
*  Rather than answer the concerns of the working people, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  focus on America's needs, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  they stayed on their twisted course, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=520.8s)]
*  importing millions of migrants into our communities, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  spending billions in giveaways to special interests, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=525.64s)]
*  crushing regulations on oil and gas, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=528.88s)]
*  continuing massive trade deficits, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  the endless war in Ukraine, and pushing their trans agenda. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=534.28s)]
*  And it has all been a colossal disaster for families, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=538.76s)]
*  young people, and especially working class Americans. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=543.32s)]
*  That's why so many say they're now voting for Trump. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  Trump's a businessman. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=552.44s)]
*  A lot of black men want to be entrepreneurs. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=553.4000000000001s)]
*  They can relate to Trump in the way to, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=556.6s)]
*  they want to make money, they want to have a business, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=559.2s)]
*  and Trump is really supporting business owners [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=561.12s)]
*  and just the everyday American. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=565.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't see Kamala doing that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  No wars, the economy was absolutely incredible. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  Everybody's making money. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=572.5999999999999s)]
*  He wasn't a dictator then. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=574.76s)]
*  Why should you be a dictator now? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  I think Trump is gonna win. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  I just can't imagine anyone voting for Kamala. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=580.3599999999999s)]
*  It's the truth, I can't. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=584.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, the fact is the smartest people [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=586.76s)]
*  from the old DC establishment [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  cannot answer Trump on any of this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=590.76s)]
*  And they're really not interested [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  in convincing anyone either. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  They want you to pipe down, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  be happy with whatever crumbs they decide to send you [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=599.56s)]
*  and do as you're told. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=603.1199999999999s)]
*  But understand this, when they denigrate and defame Trump, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=605.2399999999999s)]
*  their words are really directed [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=608.8s)]
*  at the tens of millions of voters who support him, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=611.0s)]
*  people just like you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=613.68s)]
*  Trump's just the current stand-in for the American people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=615.52s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=619.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Kamala Harris wanted another debate [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  and she got one, a debate with herself. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=623.0s)]
*  Listen, Kamala Harris participated [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=626.52s)]
*  in a one-person debate last night and she lost. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=628.36s)]
*  She was supposed to close the deal [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=631.48s)]
*  at a CNN town hall last night, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=633.12s)]
*  but somehow she made things worse. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=634.92s)]
*  I'll just tell you what I'm hearing [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=637.88s)]
*  from people who I have been talking to. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=639.2s)]
*  And that is that if her goal was to close the deal, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=641.96s)]
*  they're not sure she did that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=648.72s)]
*  And some people have asked, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=650.48s)]
*  is she being held to a different standard? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=652.44s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=654.6s)]
*  But that's maybe the world that she's living in. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=655.84s)]
*  Dana, what different standard is she being held to? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=658.8s)]
*  Is it because she's a woman? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=661.84s)]
*  Is it because she's black? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=663.76s)]
*  Is it because she's new at this? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=665.6s)]
*  Because she's not that new at this. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=667.6s)]
*  She's been a politician for 20 years. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  They're still making excuses for her. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you want a president who the media has to make excuses for? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=674.96s)]
*  We just had that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=679.4s)]
*  And that's why Kamala is the nominee. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=680.52s)]
*  If this was the final job interview, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=683.24s)]
*  Kamala's not getting a call back in any job interview. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  Sounds cliche, but they ask you, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=690.2s)]
*  what's your biggest weakness? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=692.6s)]
*  What weaknesses do you bring to the table [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=695.24s)]
*  and how do you plan to overcome them while you're in office? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  That's a great question, Joe. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=700.96s)]
*  Well, I am certainly not perfect. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=702.96s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=705.0s)]
*  And I think that perhaps a weakness is a weakness [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=706.72s)]
*  that some would say, but I actually think it's a strength [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=713.2s)]
*  is I really do value having a team [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=715.12s)]
*  of very smart people around me [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=719.0s)]
*  who bring to my decision-making process [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=721.2s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=726.76s)]
*  My team will tell you, I am constantly saying, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=729.84s)]
*  let's kick the tire on that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=732.12s)]
*  Let's kick the tires on it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  My biggest weakness, I could think of a half a dozen things [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  off the top of my head. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=739.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm impatient. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=740.76s)]
*  Sometimes I don't listen carefully. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=742.08s)]
*  Sometimes I'm late. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=744.12s)]
*  But my biggest weakness is actually my strength. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=745.84s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=748.36s)]
*  So let me ask you a question right off the bat. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=750.48s)]
*  What do you think your greatest strengths as a manager? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=754.2s)]
*  Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=756.76s)]
*  I work too hard. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  I care too much. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=761.2s)]
*  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=762.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=767.88s)]
*  And your strengths? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=769.6s)]
*  Well, my weaknesses are actually strengths. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=770.8s)]
*  Kamal is becoming the stereotype [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=775.04s)]
*  of a typical slippery politician [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=777.4s)]
*  who's just too fuzzy to trust. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=779.68s)]
*  Is there something you can point to in your life, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=782.28s)]
*  political life or in your life in the last four years [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=784.68s)]
*  that you think is a mistake that you have learned from? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=787.04s)]
*  I mean, I've made many mistakes. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  And they range from, you know, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=794.72s)]
*  if you've ever parented a child, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=800.0s)]
*  you know you make lots of mistakes too. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=801.48s)]
*  In my role as vice president, I mean, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=804.84s)]
*  I've probably worked very hard at making sure [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=807.32s)]
*  that I am well versed on issues. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=811.48s)]
*  And I think that is very important. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=816.44s)]
*  It's a mistake not to be well versed on an issue [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=819.2s)]
*  and feel compelled to answer a question. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=821.4s)]
*  You know, Kamala actually touched on something [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=823.76s)]
*  that makes her human. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=825.96s)]
*  She became a stepmother to Doug's children [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=827.72s)]
*  and she made some mistakes helping raise them. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=830.12s)]
*  That's relatable. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=833.28s)]
*  A lot of Americans deal with that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=834.56s)]
*  An answer could give us insight into who Kamala is, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=837.16s)]
*  but she gives us a phony answer [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=840.36s)]
*  that her biggest mistake is that she's too prepared. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=842.72s)]
*  Does anybody believe that Kamala Harris [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=845.36s)]
*  is over-prepared for this job? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=847.08s)]
*  Again, off the top of my head, half a dozen things. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=849.8s)]
*  I was immature in college. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=852.72s)]
*  I didn't take care of my body in my 30s. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=855.32s)]
*  I shouldn't have swallowed that pill Gutfeld gave me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=859.4s)]
*  She could have killed two birds with one stone and said, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=862.6800000000001s)]
*  well, we probably shouldn't have spent so much money [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=865.08s)]
*  on COVID recovery. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  We didn't get the number right. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=869.52s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  You show some humility and then you distance yourself [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=873.12s)]
*  from Biden in the same answer. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=876.24s)]
*  At this point, I'm not sure Kamala can answer [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=879.44s)]
*  what's your favorite color? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=882.04s)]
*  I may not be quick to have the answer [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=883.92s)]
*  as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=886.12s)]
*  sometimes because I'm gonna wanna research it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna wanna study it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=892.48s)]
*  I'm kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  If this is Kamala Harris studied [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  and well-researched, we're in trouble. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=901.92s)]
*  She spent 48 hours preparing for this town hall [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  and couldn't even answer this question. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  If you could accomplish only one major policy goal [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=910.52s)]
*  that required congressional action, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=914.0s)]
*  what would it be and why? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=916.8s)]
*  Well, there's not just one. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=920.16s)]
*  I have to be honest with you, Carol. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of work that needs to happen, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=923.4s)]
*  but I think that maybe part of this point, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  how I think about it, is we've gotta get past this era [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=929.36s)]
*  of politics and partisan politics, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=935.0799999999999s)]
*  slowing down what we need to do [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=938.24s)]
*  in terms of progress in our country. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=939.8s)]
*  She couldn't name a single thing she'd do on day one. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=942.24s)]
*  How is this race even close? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=945.04s)]
*  I'm surprised she didn't say, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=947.64s)]
*  I'll tell you what I won't do on day one, be a dictator. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=949.2s)]
*  Trump said, day one, drill baby drill and close the border. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=953.8s)]
*  Kamala said on day one, I'm gonna get past [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=958.08s)]
*  the era of partisan politics, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=961.4s)]
*  slowing down what we need to do [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=963.12s)]
*  in terms of progress in our country. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=965.04s)]
*  That's memorable. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=967.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, that is so memorable. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=969.04s)]
*  I'm sure everyone's talking about Kamala's day one agenda. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=971.4s)]
*  This is when Anderson Cooper started getting annoyed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=975.28s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=978.84s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=980.76s)]
*  So remember Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=988.64s)]
*  But you're agreeing to a bill that would earmark [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=990.12s)]
*  $650 million to continue building that wall. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=991.92s)]
*  I pledge that I'm gonna bring forward that bipartisan bill [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=995.56s)]
*  to further strengthen and secure our border. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1000.24s)]
*  We need a president who is grounded in common sense [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1003.24s)]
*  and practical outcomes. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1007.68s)]
*  Like let's just fix this thing, let's just fix it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1009.16s)]
*  Why is there any ideological perspective on this? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1012.76s)]
*  Let's just fix the problem. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1015.4399999999999s)]
*  To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1017.68s)]
*  It does call for $650 million that was earmarked under Trump [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1020.56s)]
*  to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1024.36s)]
*  I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1025.9199999999998s)]
*  So you don't think it's stupid anymore? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1028.24s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  did not make much sense [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1033.0s)]
*  because he actually didn't do much of anything. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1034.12s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1037.32s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1039.24s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1040.08s)]
*  But you do wanna build some wall. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1045.04s)]
*  Kamala's campaigning on fixing the problems she created, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1047.6s)]
*  promising to build a wall that she tore down [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1052.12s)]
*  and called stupid, but now thinks is a good idea. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1054.84s)]
*  And she's asking the voters to give her the power [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1058.8s)]
*  to do the things that she already has the power to do [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1061.2399999999998s)]
*  but hasn't done. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1064.6s)]
*  You've been in the White House for four years. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1066.4799999999998s)]
*  You were vice president, not the president, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1068.28s)]
*  but why wasn't any of that done the last four years? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1069.76s)]
*  Well, there was a lot that was done, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1074.04s)]
*  but there's more to do, Anderson. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm pointing out things that need to be done [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1077.0s)]
*  that haven't been done, but need to be done. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  They haven't been done because she hasn't done them. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1083.08s)]
*  She's done nothing except reverse the progress Trump made. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  We keep waiting for Kamala to have this big breakout moment [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1090.08s)]
*  that justifies her coronation. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1094.0s)]
*  There has to be some reason [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1096.48s)]
*  that Democrats anointed this woman. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1097.52s)]
*  And it's 12 days until the election. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1099.76s)]
*  And they're all asking her the same exact questions [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1102.48s)]
*  and expecting a better answer. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1105.12s)]
*  How can we differentiate your policy [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1107.6s)]
*  and beliefs from that of Biden's? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1109.96s)]
*  That's a great question and thank you. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1111.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, my administration will not be [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1114.08s)]
*  a continuation of the Biden administration. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1117.32s)]
*  I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1119.48s)]
*  I represent a new generation of leadership [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  on a number of issues and believe [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1128.56s)]
*  that we have to actually take new approaches. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1131.4s)]
*  What are the new approaches? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1133.76s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1136.88s)]
*  She's gotten asked the same series of questions [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1138.88s)]
*  for the last month. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1141.0800000000002s)]
*  How are you different than Joe? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1142.72s)]
*  What happened to the border? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
*  How are you gonna tackle inflation? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1145.88s)]
*  Did you notice Biden was slowing down at any time? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1148.24s)]
*  Oh, and who are you? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  And what are you gonna do on day one? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1153.92s)]
*  She's hurting herself on CNN and shows like The View. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1156.92s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1161.64s)]
*  The media has given up [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1163.5600000000002s)]
*  and now they're embarrassed that they propped her up. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1165.0400000000002s)]
*  When she doesn't wanna answer a question, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1168.64s)]
*  her habit is to kind of go to word salad city. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1171.4s)]
*  The word salad stuff gets on my nerves. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1177.8s)]
*  She focused a lot more on Donald Trump, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1179.96s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1184.2s)]
*  than she did on many specifics [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  in terms of what she would do as president. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  She's like a true double threat. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1191.3200000000002s)]
*  She's terrible on her feet [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1193.0800000000002s)]
*  when she gets unexpected questions [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1194.4s)]
*  and simultaneously, she can't even answer [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1195.84s)]
*  the expected questions. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1198.72s)]
*  It's nothing, nothing, nothing. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1200.28s)]
*  Empty, empty, empty. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  If she were an animal, she'd be a duck-billed platitude. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1203.0s)]
*  Kamala went from the next Messiah [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1205.8s)]
*  to a duck-billed platitude. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1207.3999999999999s)]
*  And you have to remember, these CNN people, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1209.9199999999998s)]
*  they're there to help. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1212.8s)]
*  This is a hand-picked town hall [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1214.48s)]
*  with her good friend Anderson, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  who isn't asking gotcha questions. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1218.0s)]
*  Oh, what's your biggest weakness? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1220.8s)]
*  What's your biggest mistake? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1222.4399999999998s)]
*  These are questions an admissions director [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1224.72s)]
*  asks a 13-year-old applying to prep school. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1227.2s)]
*  Leland, tell me about a challenge you've faced [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1230.76s)]
*  in your life that you were able to overcome. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  Could you see Anderson Cooper asking Trump the questions [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1237.68s)]
*  he's asking Kamala? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1240.28s)]
*  She is being held to a different standard [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1242.16s)]
*  and she's not even up to it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1244.4s)]
*  I think that she takes a really long time [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1246.92s)]
*  to get to her point [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1252.72s)]
*  and that she does rely on talking points too often. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1255.44s)]
*  I think she's gotten much better than she used to, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1258.44s)]
*  but it's almost as if she's afraid to say something [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1261.6s)]
*  that will later come back to haunt her. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1265.6799999999998s)]
*  I just wish she would say, this is our plan, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1268.04s)]
*  or you're right, a lot of immigrants have, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1271.6s)]
*  illegal immigrants have come into this country [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1274.48s)]
*  during the Biden administration, but this is why, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1276.84s)]
*  and this is what I wanna do about it moving forward. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1279.52s)]
*  I just, I don't find her explanation of policy [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1283.48s)]
*  that compelling compared to say someone [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1289.76s)]
*  like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1292.24s)]
*  Kamala is not Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1294.48s)]
*  Tell me something I don't know, Katie. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1297.04s)]
*  The media made Kamala from scratch this summer [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  and told everyone she was sensational [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  and are now disappointed she's collapsing [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  during the home stretch. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1307.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris was just a fantasy of the media's imagination. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1309.16s)]
*  An anything but Joe doll that they pieced together [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1312.96s)]
*  in Chicago and now they're all shocked [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1316.04s)]
*  she could barely walk. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1318.48s)]
*  The scary thing is if the election had been in September, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1320.44s)]
*  Kamala might have won and America would have been stuck [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  with a woman not even cut out to be a small town mayor. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1327.3600000000001s)]
*  That's how corrupt the Kamala candidacy is. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  It was a ruse that ran out of runway. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1334.3000000000002s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight, Democrats, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1338.04s)]
*  they have failed Americans, all of you across the country. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1339.84s)]
*  Their policies have caused backbreaking inflation, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1343.32s)]
*  rising crime, a housing crisis, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1346.28s)]
*  and of course an illegal immigration crisis. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1348.58s)]
*  It has created one of the biggest national security threats [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1352.04s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1355.12s)]
*  We now have known terrorists inside our country. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1356.82s)]
*  Iranian hit squads we know are in the country. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1359.6s)]
*  We have gang members, people that have murdered Americans, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  raped American, violent crimes committed against Americans. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1365.78s)]
*  We have cartels and the list can go on and on. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1369.28s)]
*  And now even simple tasks have become worse [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1372.68s)]
*  under the radical policies of Harris and Biden. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1375.72s)]
*  You can't even buy laundry detergent [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1378.3799999999999s)]
*  without having to call over a cashier in some stores [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1381.48s)]
*  to unlock some glass security case. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1384.52s)]
*  That is if you can actually afford it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1387.52s)]
*  And gassing up, yeah, buck, buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1389.52s)]
*  How does that feel every time you fill up your car? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1394.68s)]
*  Now, no matter how hard you work, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  the American dream is now getting out of reach [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1397.54s)]
*  for so many people, two thirds of Americans [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1400.46s)]
*  saying they're gulping water. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1402.54s)]
*  Washington Post even suggesting that Americans [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1404.1s)]
*  now need to give up on the American dream [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1407.34s)]
*  of a house or the backyard, settle for a townhouse. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1409.6599999999999s)]
*  Really, we should settle? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1414.34s)]
*  No, how about we aspire to? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1416.06s)]
*  And the media mob and the left wing, you know, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1418.24s)]
*  in this country scratching their heads. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1421.18s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump doing so well? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1423.56s)]
*  It's not sexism as suggested by Barack Obama [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1426.02s)]
*  or racism and sexism suggested by, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1430.14s)]
*  of African American men as alleged by Stacey Abrams. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  Pretty insulting comments. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1437.66s)]
*  These surrogates for Kamala, they're not doing too well. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1439.1s)]
*  They're not helping her. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1442.22s)]
*  Now, coming up tonight, we'll check in with my buddy, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1443.58s)]
*  our friend, Stephen A. Smith. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1445.42s)]
*  He will join us with more on why Kamala Harris [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1446.82s)]
*  is actually losing so much support [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1450.1s)]
*  from African American men and Hispanic American men. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1452.18s)]
*  But let's be clear about this. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1455.66s)]
*  The serious problems that are facing most Americans, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1457.26s)]
*  they're not going to get better [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1460.74s)]
*  under a Harris administration. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1462.8200000000002s)]
*  She even said, I'll change nothing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1464.98s)]
*  At best, that would be the best case scenario. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1467.02s)]
*  She'd be a continuation of Joe Biden, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1469.7s)]
*  which in and of itself is a continuation [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1472.8200000000002s)]
*  of American decline. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1475.7s)]
*  At worst, she will embrace her stated positions, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1477.26s)]
*  her own words, those core radical extremes, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1481.14s)]
*  socialist Marxist values, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1484.66s)]
*  and kind of turn America into Venezuela. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1486.74s)]
*  Now, during a disastrous town hall last night, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1489.46s)]
*  Kamala failed to take any responsibility [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1492.0600000000002s)]
*  for the failures of the Harris-Biden administration [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1494.74s)]
*  and could not or would not say [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1497.3400000000001s)]
*  how the next four years would be any different. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1499.7s)]
*  It was a disaster last night. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1502.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1504.6200000000001s)]
*  Some voters though might ask, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1505.7s)]
*  you've been in the White House for four years. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1506.98s)]
*  You were vice president, not the president, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1508.78s)]
*  but why wasn't any of that done the last four years? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1510.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, there was a lot that was done, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1515.5s)]
*  but there's more to do, Anderson. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1516.82s)]
*  And I'm pointing out things that need to be done, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1518.54s)]
*  that haven't been done, but need to be done. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1521.5s)]
*  And I'm not going to shy away from saying, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1523.9399999999998s)]
*  hey, these are still problems that we need to fix. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  Haven't been done, need to be done. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1531.34s)]
*  We have to do them. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1533.34s)]
*  I can't take it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1535.5s)]
*  Apparently your border czar, Kamala Harris, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1536.5s)]
*  was just not prepared for a question [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1539.06s)]
*  about illegal immigration or her hypocrisy [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1541.1s)]
*  about the wall. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1545.5s)]
*  She once called that Donald Trump Medieval Vanity Project. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1546.34s)]
*  How was it even possible? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1550.34s)]
*  She didn't have an answer for this. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1553.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1556.58s)]
*  more than 50 times. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1558.8999999999999s)]
*  You called it stupid, useless, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1559.98s)]
*  and a medieval vanity project. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1561.8999999999999s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1564.58s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1566.5s)]
*  So remember Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1569.3s)]
*  But you're agreeing to a bill that would earmark [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1574.46s)]
*  $650 million to continue building that wall. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1576.34s)]
*  I pledge that I'm going to bring forward [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1579.1s)]
*  that bipartisan bill to further strengthen [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1582.3799999999999s)]
*  and secure our border. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1586.46s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1587.6599999999999s)]
*  To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1588.58s)]
*  It does call for $650 million that was earmarked [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1591.46s)]
*  under Trump to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1594.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1596.86s)]
*  You don't think it's stupid anymore? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1599.26s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1601.26s)]
*  did not make much sense because he actually [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1603.9s)]
*  didn't do much of anything. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1605.5800000000002s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1608.22s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1610.1000000000001s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1610.94s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1613.3000000000002s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1615.9s)]
*  Oh my gosh, just to get a simple answer. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1619.6200000000001s)]
*  Tonight Kamala Harris is getting mocked [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1622.0600000000002s)]
*  and ridiculed for that performance, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1624.0600000000002s)]
*  especially when she declared her only weakness [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1625.66s)]
*  was that she cares too much and she works too hard [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1628.26s)]
*  and surrounds herself with good people [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1631.38s)]
*  and everything. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1634.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1635.1000000000001s)]
*  What weaknesses do you bring to the table [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1635.94s)]
*  and how do you plan to overcome them [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1637.46s)]
*  while you're in office? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1639.5s)]
*  That's a great question, Joe. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1641.38s)]
*  Well, I am certainly not perfect. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1643.38s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1645.42s)]
*  Perhaps a weakness, some would say, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1652.82s)]
*  but I actually think it's the strength, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1654.14s)]
*  is I really do value having a team of very smart people [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1655.6200000000001s)]
*  around me who bring to my decision-making process [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1660.9799999999998s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1667.2199999999998s)]
*  And that is why I engage and bring folks around. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1668.7399999999998s)]
*  So I may not be quick to have the answer [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1672.6599999999999s)]
*  as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1675.1s)]
*  sometimes because I'm gonna want to research it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1678.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna want to study it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1681.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1683.7399999999998s)]
*  And some might call that a weakness. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1688.1s)]
*  The giggling, the non-answer. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1691.5s)]
*  You know, the passage of time is about time passing. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1694.5s)]
*  Our communities are about people in the community [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1697.82s)]
*  that like the community because they live together [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1700.6599999999999s)]
*  in the community as a community. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1702.78s)]
*  Democrats cannot be happy tonight. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1705.4199999999998s)]
*  One political analyst of fake news CNN [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1708.1s)]
*  said Kamala participated in a one-person debate [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  and she lost. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1714.1s)]
*  David Axelrod called her performance pretty, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1715.3s)]
*  I wish I'd thought of it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1718.02s)]
*  A word salad city and frustration and despair [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1718.8999999999999s)]
*  at fake news CNN was palpable. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1722.78s)]
*  You know if you lost CNN, you lost. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1726.1799999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1730.1799999999998s)]
*  The things that would concern me is when she doesn't [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1732.02s)]
*  want to answer a question, her habit is to kind of [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1734.3s)]
*  go to word salad city and she did that on a couple [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1738.3799999999999s)]
*  of answers. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1741.4599999999998s)]
*  One was on Israel. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1742.3s)]
*  Anderson asked a direct question. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1743.1399999999999s)]
*  Would you be stronger on Israel than David? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1744.58s)]
*  Would you be stronger on Israel than Trump? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1747.22s)]
*  And there was a seven minute answer but none of it [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1750.02s)]
*  related to the question he was asking. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1754.02s)]
*  If her goal was to close the deal, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1756.26s)]
*  they're not sure she did that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1760.42s)]
*  I think that the word salad stuff gets on my nerves. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1761.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that some of the evasions are not necessary. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1764.42s)]
*  She focused a lot more on Donald Trump. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1766.5800000000002s)]
*  I think it's fair to say than she did on many specifics [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1770.8200000000002s)]
*  in terms of what she would do. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1774.98s)]
*  Kamala Harris participated in a one person debate [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1777.26s)]
*  last night and she lost. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1778.94s)]
*  The word salad, the giggling, the non-answers, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1782.22s)]
*  the Donald Trump is Hitler and he's a fascist. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean it's just unbelievable we're at this point. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1788.42s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, he couldn't believe how bad [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1793.5400000000002s)]
*  Kamala's answers were. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1795.5400000000002s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1796.5800000000002s)]
*  She said during that town hall, she believes they've [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1797.9s)]
*  handled the border correctly. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1800.26s)]
*  CNN pressed her on it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1801.74s)]
*  Would you have done anything different? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1803.0600000000002s)]
*  Do you regret anything? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1804.26s)]
*  And she said quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1805.42s)]
*  Wait a minute, that she's handled it correctly? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1807.6200000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1809.5800000000002s)]
*  She said that? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1811.8600000000001s)]
*  She said that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1812.7s)]
*  She said quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1813.5400000000002s)]
*  We allowed 21 million people in. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1814.98s)]
*  We allowed 13,099 murderers. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1816.9s)]
*  We allowed mental institutions from all over the world. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1820.0600000000002s)]
*  If she said that, look, she's a grossly incompetent person [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1823.1000000000001s)]
*  and if she said that, they had the worst border in history. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1827.8200000000002s)]
*  Now as you can probably tell, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1832.46s)]
*  almost no one on either side of the aisle, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1833.54s)]
*  this thing says Kamala Harris is a good candidate. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1837.42s)]
*  Make no mistake here, she would be an even worse president. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1841.06s)]
*  That's the scary part and her closing argument to you, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1844.14s)]
*  the American people, is that Donald Trump is a fascist [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1846.78s)]
*  and a Nazi and that her surrogates are claiming [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1850.06s)]
*  that she's Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1853.42s)]
*  We have all heard these smears times and times again. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1856.26s)]
*  By the way, by Democrats historically, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1861.1399999999999s)]
*  over the last eight years, they even compared John McCain, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1863.8999999999999s)]
*  Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan to Hitler. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1868.82s)]
*  And meanwhile, Trump's presidency was marked by, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1871.82s)]
*  let's see, global peace, economic growth and stability [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1873.98s)]
*  and by some measures, the best we'd had in 60 years, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1877.78s)]
*  wealth income going up, lowest job for minorities [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1881.78s)]
*  in this country that had suffered under the Obama years [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1885.6999999999998s)]
*  and the Biden years and Israel never had a better friend [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1889.26s)]
*  in the White House than Donald J. Trump [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1892.8600000000001s)]
*  and needless to say, Americans, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1895.18s)]
*  they're just not buying Kamala's smear campaign. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1897.74s)]
*  As of tonight, Donald Trump is up [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  in four separate national polls, national. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1902.42s)]
*  He's up by three in the Wall Street Journal [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1904.7s)]
*  and up by two according to NBC. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1907.26s)]
*  He's up by two and over 50% according to Forbes. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1909.54s)]
*  Rasmussen has him up by three. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1914.82s)]
*  Now these polls looked a lot different four years ago, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1917.18s)]
*  even though Trump lost by razor thin margin, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1920.0600000000002s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal had him down [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1923.5s)]
*  by a whopping 10 points in 2020. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1925.66s)]
*  CNBC showed him down 10. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1928.02s)]
*  Rasmussen had Trump down by one. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1930.26s)]
*  And at this point in 2020, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1933.0600000000002s)]
*  zero national polls showed Donald Trump in the lead. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1935.14s)]
*  In fact, the Real Clear Politics average showed Biden up [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1938.5800000000002s)]
*  by more than eight points at this point in 2020. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1941.3s)]
*  And now Harris is up by less than eight point [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1945.3s)]
*  and trending in the wrong direction. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1948.1399999999999s)]
*  And in the battleground states, Real Clear Politics, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1950.3799999999999s)]
*  you see a similar pattern. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1952.86s)]
*  At this point in 2020, Trump was down [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1954.46s)]
*  by nearly a point in Georgia, more than five in Wisconsin, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1956.58s)]
*  more than five in Pennsylvania, more than nine in Michigan, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1959.6599999999999s)]
*  more than two points in Arizona, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1962.86s)]
*  more than five points in Nevada, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1964.86s)]
*  and more than a point in North Carolina. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1966.86s)]
*  Now every one of those states has flipped [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1969.54s)]
*  and Donald Trump is leading the Real Clear Politics [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1971.86s)]
*  average in the battleground states. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1975.06s)]
*  His favorability rating is also up four points, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1976.54s)]
*  while Kamala's favorability is more than seven points lower [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1979.86s)]
*  than Biden at this point in 2020. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1984.06s)]
*  But again, there's only one poll, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1986.1399999999999s)]
*  and I say this with all seriousness, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1988.3799999999999s)]
*  it's only one poll that matters, and that's election day. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1991.22s)]
*  And despite a dramatic shift in the polls [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1995.46s)]
*  and the betting markets, this race is still [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=1997.74s)]
*  within the margin of error. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2000.26s)]
*  I am asking everybody, if you care about the future [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2001.98s)]
*  of your country, you wanna leave it in a better position [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2005.6599999999999s)]
*  for your children and grandchildren, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2007.34s)]
*  assume that your vote will decide the outcome of this race. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2009.1799999999998s)]
*  Don't forget that red wave in 2022, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2014.02s)]
*  everybody was predicting it never materialized, did it? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2017.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are desperate, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2021.3s)]
*  they are terrified of losing power, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2023.26s)]
*  they hate Donald Trump, they will jump through hoops [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2025.3s)]
*  to turn out their base. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2028.1399999999999s)]
*  The only way to counter this is to treat [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2029.6599999999999s)]
*  every single day like election day. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2031.94s)]
*  In states all across the country, it's election day. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2034.98s)]
*  You can vote tomorrow morning, and don't wait. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2038.6200000000001s)]
*  The polls, get out, vote, bank your vote. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2042.5s)]
*  I talked to my friend Joe Bustardi, weatherbell.com. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2046.02s)]
*  He said, Sean, we may have as many [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2049.06s)]
*  as two more hurricanes this year. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2050.6600000000003s)]
*  What if it happens election week? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2052.02s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2053.38s)]
*  This is not the system I want, system we got, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2054.62s)]
*  you wanna change it, you gotta win elections. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2lyzGPOGE&t=2057.06s)]
