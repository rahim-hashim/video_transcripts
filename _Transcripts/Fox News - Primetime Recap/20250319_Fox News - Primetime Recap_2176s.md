# Fox News Highlights - March 18, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI)
*  Fox News alert. Elon just rescued two astronauts that Biden left floating around in space for nine months. The SpaceX [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=0.0s)]
*  Dragon splashdown in the Gulf of America during the five. As you can see there on your screen continuing to monitor progress [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=8.56s)]
*  of the Dragon spacecraft. And we're going to stand by for splashdown located in the Gulf of America off the coast of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Tallahassee Florida. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=27.84s)]
*  And splashdown crew nine back on Earth. After they hit the Gulf SpaceX rescue crews motorboated the pod into the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=35.76s)]
*  mothership where they popped open the hatch and pulled them out. SpaceX is go for recovery personnel to approach. We can see [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  folks on board clapping as our first crew member. And that is NASA astronaut Nick Hague commander of crew nine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=56.36s)]
*  Now out of Crew Dragon freedom. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=68.44s)]
*  Some smiles thumbs up in a wave can't get any better than that. When he was first elected Donald Trump promised to save the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=73.68s)]
*  forgotten men and women of America no matter where they were in the Rust Belt or on the space station. Elon Musk offered to bring [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=81.0s)]
*  these astronauts home months ago. But Joe Biden was too insecure to let Elon and by extension Trump be a hero during the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=89.0s)]
*  election. So Joe let him float. You're going to help rescue next month two astronauts that I think were manned. And they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=95.6s)]
*  dispute that in an interview. When the president's request or instruction we are accelerating the return of the astronauts which was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  postponed kind of to a ridiculous degree. They got left in space. They've been there. They were supposed to be there eight days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=113.28s)]
*  They're there almost 300 Biden. They were put. Yes they were left up there for political reasons which is not good. This is a unifying [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=120.0s)]
*  moment for the country. Everyone's sitting around the TV watching our people splashdown. But some people aren't grateful. They [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=126.56s)]
*  won't give you on any credit and they won't even call it the Gulf of America. And they're still covering up for the big guy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=134.24s)]
*  Let me say something. I was watching the previous your previous program the five. They're talking about a bandit and they were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=142.8s)]
*  stranded by President Biden. That is not true. They have had a spacecraft up there since September that was going to bring them [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  home. They've always had a ride home and the decision to keep them up there had nothing to do with politics. It was just the fact that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=159.88s)]
*  you need crew members to operate the space station. And they were the two that were there and you had to send up a vehicle with two [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=167.16s)]
*  empty seats. So the safest thing to do was to just leave them there. They've always had a ride home. That was Democrat Senator Mark Kelly's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  brother by the way. If they always had a ride home why did it take so long. When I landed the airport I don't wait around. I get home as fast as I can. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=183.52s)]
*  Why would I wait for a train that's coming in an hour if I can get an Uber like that. And why are Democrats defending Biden stranding our people in space. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=191.72s)]
*  For a guy who's always had a ride home this astronaut sounds pretty grateful. Listen we're coming back before long. So you know don't make all those plans [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  without me. I can tell you at the outset we have all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously respect and admiration for our president of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=211.56s)]
*  the United States Donald Trump. We appreciate them. We appreciate all that they do for us or a human spaceflight for our nation. Biden let our country get [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=220.28s)]
*  invaded. He allowed men and women's locker rooms let down kids during covid took forever to open up the economy. There was never any urgency. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  Inflation. It'll go away. There was no fight in this man. He led American hostages wither all over the world. The minute Trump selected they're back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  This Ukraine war would have gone on forever. Biden never even picked up the phone and called Putin once. Trump spent two hours on the phone with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  Vlad today and they hashed out a semi ceasefire. Biden let America die and fell asleep on the beach because he didn't care. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=257.52s)]
*  You're not going to get all you want all at once. I know. But Biden never even tried bringing back astronauts is like what makes us proud. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=266.36s)]
*  When have you known America to just give up. The Army's credo is no man left behind and that credo is founded on hard work and ingenuity. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=277.12s)]
*  And we're applying those principles to saving our country from bankruptcy. Look what Doge uncovered. I call it magic my computer a computer [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=287.44s)]
*  which can just make money out of thin air. That's magic money. So how does that work. It just issues payments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=295.84s)]
*  And you said something like 11 of these computers at Treasury that are sending out trillions in payments. They're mostly Treasury. Some are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=303.08s)]
*  with the sum at HHS some that there's one is one or two states. There's some at the D.D. I think we found now 14 magic money computers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  We're 18. OK. They just send money out of nothing. Democrats are begging him to use a scalpel while there's magic money machines pumping out [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  billions of dollars. Doge is cleaning up Social Security payrolls. Three million people over the age of 120 were finally officially declared [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=332.24s)]
*  debt. The V.A. just Doge taxpayer funded gender affirming prosthetics. Not only were they having orgies at the V.A. on the clock at the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=342.24s)]
*  hospital they went home with goodie bags and the Democrats are furious because much must caught him stealing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=352.6s)]
*  One of the biggest scam froth holes we've uncovered which is really crazy is is that is that the government could give money to a so [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  called nonprofit with with very few controls and then that. And there's there's no auditing subsequently of that nonprofit. They then give [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=370.4s)]
*  themselves extremely lavish like insane salaries expense everything kept to the nonprofit. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  Buy jets and homes and all sorts of things. Link live like kings and queens. Yes. On the taxpayer. Correct. You you mentioned this is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=385.28s)]
*  happening at scale. It's not just one or two. We're seeing this everywhere. It's so bad that bureaucrats are locking themselves in their [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=392.64s)]
*  office like they're Bruce Willis and die hard. One Fed bunkered himself under his desk and called Wolf Blitzer like it was breaking news [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  saying Doge has broken into our building. If you think CNN can save you CNN can't even save themselves. Washington ripped you off and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  stabbed you in the back. And Schumer says you're the one with an attitude. They are controlled by a small group of wealthy greedy people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  And you know what their attitude is. I made my money all by myself. How dare your government take my money from me. I don't want to pay [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=427.36s)]
*  taxes or I built my company with my bare hands. How dare your government tell me how I should treat my customers. My the land and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  order water that I own or my employees. They hate government. Government's a barrier to people. The barrier to stop them from doing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  things. They want to destroy it. We are not letting them do it. And we're united. Schumer saying you're greedy and his party just got caught [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=452.12s)]
*  fleecing you to buy strap ons. We don't want to destroy government. No one's even saying that. We're just saying the same things Democrats [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  including Schumer have been saying for decades. There's tremendous waste in government. And I think any Democrat who ignores the lessons [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=468.64s)]
*  of those who voted the lessons of the last election makes a mistake. The people did want government to cut out the waste and to shrink. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=477.64s)]
*  Chuck's trotting out that old Obama line. You didn't build that that when Americans work hard and are successful they owe a lot of that to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=488.36s)]
*  the government. Anyone who owns a business knows the government gets in the way of business. And if the government got out of the way just [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=495.48s)]
*  even a little bit business would be booming. And Elon's business used to be booming. But now the media is calling on Americans to dump his [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=502.8s)]
*  stock and are looking the other way while Trantifa torches Tesla's. But you'll see a Tesla vehicle catch fire momentarily. You'll see the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=510.36s)]
*  suspect pop up right next to the Tesla vehicle. That individual then appears to be reaching into some kind of bag or backpack and then he'll walk [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=519.28s)]
*  back and forth from that vehicle that's already on fire to another vehicle. The loud bang that you just heard we believe was a gunshot that was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  fired into one of the Tesla vehicles and a longer version of the clip. There are two gunshots in addition to that that are heard. Also point out [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=534.48s)]
*  that we have recovered at least one unignited Molotov cocktail located in one of the Tesla vehicles. This is what the mob does when they get [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=542.48s)]
*  caught. They light your car on fire to send a message. Democrat Senator Mark Kelly whose brother just made a fool of himself just sold his [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=549.28s)]
*  Tesla and bought two gas guzzlers. All right. Here I am with my new ride Chevy. Good old Chevy Tahoe here in Washington D.C. Got one of these [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=557.4s)]
*  in Tucson as well. This one was made by union labor United Auto Workers in Arlington Texas. It was good to buy union cars. Incredibly reliable. And I'm [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=568.72s)]
*  looking forward to driving this for many many years. Democrats are admitting they don't even believe in global warming. Trump just made Democrats [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  admit global warming is a hoax. Musk's cars were supposed to save the planet and they're letting them on fire and buying Chevy Tahoe's. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=589.2s)]
*  Democrats aren't interested in saving the country. They're only interested in saving themselves. Trump saving lives money factories and women [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=598.4s)]
*  whether they like it or not. Welcome to Hannity and tonight in mere moments Elon Musk will join us live from the Washington swamp a huge day for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=607.36s)]
*  Elon Musk for SpaceX for President Trump and for our country. If you were watching all day today how could you not feel inspired grateful. So glad that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=619.8s)]
*  these astronauts lost in space basically are now safely back home. Now the president did ask Elon to go get our stranded astronauts from the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  International Space Station and he delivered. He delivered big time. Take a look. And we're going to stand by for splashdown located in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=638.12s)]
*  Gulf of America off the coast of Tallahassee Florida. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=647.68s)]
*  And splashdown crew nine back on Earth. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=658.24s)]
*  It really is amazing. I mean that is incredible. What human ingenuity engineering the human spirit on display makes you proud to be an [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=667.28s)]
*  American mission accomplished just hours ago. The SpaceX Dragon reentered orbit. It's splashdown off the coast of Florida safely bringing home [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=676.04s)]
*  sunny Sunni Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth after being trapped at the International Space Station since June of last year. Now this [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  SpaceX capsule that you see right there on your screen was traveling through space at a whopping 17000 miles per hour before reentering orbit and then gently gliding down to the ocean within a minute of their expected landing coming up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=694.12s)]
*  We're going to have plenty of politics surrounding the increasingly radical Democratic Party and Chuck Schumer's disastrous media appearances today. It was bad as he officially now is on the chopping block and is fighting for his political life. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=710.5200000000001s)]
*  Along with a full rundown of the newly released JFK files. But first for a moment can we just put aside all partisanship for a second. I don't know if some people they're capable of it. If you suffer from Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=724.4000000000001s)]
*  Just take in this moment how remarkable this is this moment of time. What we're witnessing history in the making right here the United States of America on Friday the SpaceX Falcon 9 propelled its Dragon space capsule and crew into space. It's amazing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=738.76s)]
*  I mean that in and of itself what you're watching on your screen is such risk taking at the highest level. And a few minutes later the first stage booster remember performed a separation and a flip maneuver and then touch back down precisely at the landing at landing zone one. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=757.6s)]
*  Look at this touchdown. It's incredible right where it's supposed to. The Dragon then separated from Falcon 9 second stage and was piloted to the International Space Station where docking happened successfully. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=776.6s)]
*  Now keep in mind this was one of three Falcon 9 missions in less than 24 hours. In addition to this rescue mission the Falcon 9 also delivered 74 rideshare payloads into orbit added 23 Starlink satellites to the constellation. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=789.92s)]
*  And on March 16th the Dragon successfully docked at the space station and two days later it successfully departed ultimately returning our two stranded astronauts back to earth on time to the minute. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=806.24s)]
*  This was a safe return. But after nine months in space both astronauts will have their fair share of health challenges. Now according to NASA for example bones lose 1 percent of their density for every single month in space. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Muscle atrophy can pose a huge problem. They have to exercise every day in space and they exercise for two hours a day. The eyes the brain structure also change in space due to the lack of gravity. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=834.48s)]
*  This can cause blurry vision and other serious problems. There's also a variety of skin conditions that astronauts experience as they re acclimate to earth. That's not an easy acclimation. Now tonight we all wish both astronauts a speedy [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  recovery and good health. We are also extremely grateful to Elon Musk the team at SpaceX for getting them home safe and sound. President Trump to given the OK for this mission to go forward. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=863.52s)]
*  Unfortunately so many on the left they are not grateful. They are not thankful in any way shape manner or form. Simply they loathe Elon Musk now more than ever. This is a guy that rescues astronauts that were trapped in space. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=874.84s)]
*  They're only supposed to be there eight days. They were there for 286 days. He sends life saving communications via Starlink to North Carolina and Tennessee after Hurricane Helene. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=887.6s)]
*  He sent them to California after the California wildfires. He sent them to Ukraine after they were invaded. This is a guy working on the cutting edge of technology to advance the human condition improve life including one of the things [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=898.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm most fascinated in and that's Neuralink using AI technology and the human brain which hopefully one day we will be able to restore vision to the blind and movement to people that have been paralyzed. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=912.28s)]
*  But now because he's supporting President Trump and he's working to make government more efficient and eliminating waste fraud and abuse. This is the thanks he gets from the left. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=927.8s)]
*  Elon Musk experienced death threat after death threat. Hitler comparison after Hitler comparison acts of domestic terrorism at his dealerships and at his charging stations. You have Tesla's lit ablaze Molotov cocktails thrown at Tesla dealerships. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=937.88s)]
*  Tesla stations burned to the ground. Shots fired into Tesla showrooms. One in Oregon early this morning in Las Vegas. Another attack. A suspect armed with a gun fired shots into a Tesla collision center while also lighting multiple vehicles on fire and spray painting the word resist on the front of that building. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=954.72s)]
*  This is not a protest. This is not a simple act of vandalism for those idiots at MSDNC. As Elon Musk posted himself on X quote this level of violence is insane. It is deeply wrong. Tesla just makes electric cars. They have done nothing to deserve these evil attacks. Let's be clear. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=975.2s)]
*  What we're witnessing is terrorism. Plain and simple domestic terrorism. These left wing lunatics are committing these acts of violence to intimidate Elon Musk to intimidate Tesla owners and anyone that dares to disagree with their twisted worldview. That is the very definition of terrorism. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=996.52s)]
*  And now attorney Pam attorney general Pam Bondi will be investigating and trying these perpetrators as domestic terrorists. And like most terrorists I think that we're going to find that they're not very smart. We did have one suspect in South Carolina allegedly trying to burn down a Tesla charging station with a Molotov cocktail and accidentally set himself on fire in the process. He is now facing a 20 year jail sentence in a federal prison. This kind of violence is unacceptable in the United States. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1013.68s)]
*  Of America. But for the radical left it's all just a means to an end. But that won't deter President Trump is not deterring Elon Musk. And today is proof that all their hard work is paying off. Now we'll check in with Elon Musk in a minute. But think about this. You know for all the talk about January 6 January 6 January 6 OK. All the talk about that. What about the five hundred and seventy four riots that took place in the summer of 2020 where we had two different [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1043.68s)]
*  dead Americans. We had cops pelted with bricks rocks bottles Molotov cocktails. We had billions of dollars in property damage. And why didn't Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney have a committee looking into that violence. Why did the preferred candidate of the left go on Colbert and say those those those writers aren't going to stop. They shouldn't stop. And we're not going to stop supporting them. And why did the media lie and say oh they're mostly peaceful when a city or a town is burning [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1073.68s)]
*  over their shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you call fans Jesse. Good evening everyone. That's President Trump threatens [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1103.68s)]

*  According to Trump Hunter Biden had 18 secret service agents paid for by U.S. taxpayers all for his protection. Wow. Who knew you needed 18 secret service agents to put on a condom. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1145.92s)]
*  The U.S. postal worker funded a lavish lifestyle at strip clubs by stealing one point six million dollars in checks from the mail. He first aroused suspicion when he tipped a stripper by stuffing a pottery barn catalog into her G string. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1160.12s)]

*  According to new reports the Mexican cartels are smuggling drugs into the U.S. inside cattle. I don't know about you but I feel bad for the guy who actually has to put the drugs inside those cows. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1212.08s)]
*  Those cows. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1224.04s)]
*  A CNN poll found only 29 percent of Americans view Democrats in a favorable light. Fifty four percent viewed them in an unfavorable light and 100 percent prefer to view Rashida Tlaib in no light. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1234.3999999999999s)]

*  And finally in Germany a parade of nearly 900 Datsuns set a new world record. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1264.12s)]

*  That lets you a monologue. Excuse me. It's official the Democratic Party's popularity is deeper in the toilet than a bulimic breakfast. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1291.76s)]
*  She. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1301.48s)]

*  According to a new CNN poll and this is CNN mind you the Democrat Party's favorability among the American public is 29 percent 29 percent. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1315.2s)]
*  That's shocking but even more shocking CNN can still afford a pollster. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1325.24s)]
*  Even among Dems in independence their favorable view of Democrats right now is down 9 percent since January which is a pretty mild drop given the Dems are for absolutely nothing good while defending everything bad. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1331.4s)]
*  So all they can do is cry scream sing and smear people. Frankly I am so tired of the way they use the N word. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1346.44s)]
*  What. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1355.12s)]
*  Not see this not see that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1356.08s)]
*  Yeah that's fine. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1360.12s)]
*  Not see on signs not see spray painted on businesses if they keep normalizing that horrible word people are going to start greeting each other on the street with what up my Nazi. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1361.36s)]
*  Not. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1371.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh he said not. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1379.7199999999998s)]
*  And yet a majority of Democrats say their congressmen should oppose Trump no matter what even if it keeps them from getting the things they claim they want. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's called cutting off your nose despite your face or what Pelosi's plastic surgeon calls the number six. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1392.76s)]
*  No wonder they're less popular than Leah Thomas out of gynecologist. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1402.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's run through their greatest hits. They defended dudes and girls locker rooms. They defended the brainwashing and butchery of kids. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1407.6399999999999s)]
*  They condemn the deportation of rapists and thugs from other countries. They condemn the ending of government waste fraud and abuse. That's just four things off the top of my head. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1416.36s)]
*  And you wonder why the Democrats aren't more popular. Compare that to the sickening things Trump has done in the last month. Close the border. That's terrible. Deporting rapists and thugs. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1425.8799999999999s)]
*  Awful. Rescuing astronauts repulsive creating a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Fascist getting hostages back from Hamas appalling. Truly this guy sucks. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1436.24s)]
*  If you're the bad guy. Now disagreement is normal among opposing parties. But the Dems only complain about the things Trump might do. While Trump and the rest of us point out what the Dems have already done. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  Dems call Trump a threat to democracy. Great. Fine. But where is this magical threat to democracy that you speak of. Meanwhile everything the Dems do is seen by every single American. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1463.0800000000002s)]
*  The murders and rapes by illegal thugs sanctuary cities turning hotels into criminal clubhouses. The Hamas support on campuses. The no cash bail that heightened criminal recidivism mass looting in stores after reducing severity of punishment. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1474.68s)]
*  None of this is defined as what the Democrats might do. It's what the Democrats did. It's why you have to fight them on every issue because if they get their way Americans get hurt. But if Trump has his way oddly it's what Americans want. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1488.76s)]
*  But some Dems are too stupid to know any better. Don Lemon went on. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1503.6399999999999s)]
*  It's how you use a swear word. Don Lemon went on Bill Maher's podcast and gave the Dems some advice that only he could give. People love AOC. People love Jasmine Crockett. People love Eric Swalwell. And I think that the Democratic Party should [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1514.12s)]
*  put the people out there who the people want. They should put the the the politicians out there who the people want who they're asking for who are meeting the moment with the same energy that they're not asking for AOC. Yes they are. The people you party with. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1531.52s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't know homeless people partied. Even though Maher isn't high enough to believe that. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1548.48s)]
*  Meanwhile one Democrat is making some sense. I wonder does Massachusetts rep Seth Moulton think the Democrats have become a party of people who preach down to others. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1554.64s)]
*  We've become a party of people who preach down to others who scold them who say if you don't agree with me you're not only wrong but you're a bad person. That sounds so good. It's weird though. Isn't there another [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1565.8400000000001s)]
*  Seth Moulton who said not only is Trump racist he's a threat to our national security. We must have two Seth Moulton's one saying one thing and one saying the other. They're both dorks. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  But hey does he think they need to stop preaching and start listening. I think we need to stop preaching and start listening start meeting Americans where they are. I agree Seth. Now tell that to the other [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1591.36s)]
*  Seth Moulton who said Donald Trump is a racist and a criminal. I wonder can you be a majority party if you don't accept a majority of views. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1604.24s)]
*  You can't be a majority party if you don't accept a majority of views. Well Seth I hate to break it to you. The majority view is that the Democrats suck. So how do you solve a problem when you are the problem. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1614.04s)]
*  You're like a guy getting dumped who says but I can change I can change. But it's too late. You should have changed when you saw the harm you were causing and not waited until you lost because now America started seeing other people and they aren't bad crazy. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1627.6000000000001s)]

*  Jamie a nice question for you. Does the Democrats favor ability plummeting remind you of how your awful marriage imploded and your terrible career falling apart and your non-existent relationship with your kids. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1692.56s)]
*  That is it did. There's a lot. There's a lot all at once. Yeah that's baseline. He actually reminded me of my career. That's the trajectory right there. The approval rating. I don't I honestly don't think it's that best. 29 percent which is exactly 29 percent higher than my approval rating in my marriage. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1713.8s)]
*  And but they just asked one one bitch what she thought. But can I just take a moment and just don lemon. Can we just. Yes. Can we be done with Don. My dad used to always tell me he's like when life gives you lemons you change the channel. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1734.68s)]
*  That guy sucks. He's why are we still I mean I get I appreciate Mar having a mom but it's like he went from being on TV right being an anchor to sort of being a co-anchor to then being on a podcast. I believe the next step is just speaking loudly on the subway. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1750.88s)]
*  Yes that's what he will do next. I feel like the lemon law like that you know the lemon law like cars. I feel like the lemon law should apply to Don Lemon. You know what I mean. Like it looks good at first and he go home and he goes things a piece of. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1765.6s)]

*  There's a couple other guys in here. Michael Malice finally you're back. Good to see you. So much Greg. Yes yes yes. Do you believe that the demise of the Democrats is premature. Am I jumping the gun here. This isn't even the first. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1800.64s)]
*  I'm sorry to be the guy who's going to ruin the party but I'm going to be the guy who ruined the party. This isn't even the first quarter of Trump's presidency. The Democratic Party is the oldest political party on earth and you don't last that long unless you're doing something right. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1816.04s)]
*  And what they know how to do is to seize and maintain power. This is a temporary thing. A lot of things Trump are doing are great but it's only going to be a matter of time till they regroup and put someone forward who's going to do something smarter for them. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1827.44s)]
*  They have the universities they have the corporate press this idea that you only air quotes have 217 house seats and you're done. It's just crazy to me. You know I like that you say that because you don't want to get cocky and you don't want everybody says they're finished and then they regroup like the Terminator and terminate. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1839.14s)]
*  You know who said they were finished in 1996 Rush Limbaugh second book came out and he said this is the death knell of liberalism. We're seeing the Democratic Party and then you had what 12 years later Obama with super majorities in both houses. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1855.64s)]
*  They're very very smart. And here's the thing I think conservatives appreciate. They will throw whoever they need to over under the bus as long as it sees that serves them power. In 2004 when John Kerry was running against George Bush for a second term. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1869.14s)]
*  You know Bill Clinton told him to do run against gay marriage. Yes. So they don't care about any single group. And you see this in Britain where the party is called Labor. And as soon as people who are in union start voting for the Tories they're called Nazis white supremacists and all these other things. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1882.24s)]
*  So they're very dangerous. And again they're the they're the consequence of the universities in the media. So even if you're having a hold in D.C. you're still worrying about Cambridge and all these New Haven all these other places. You are such an adorable wet blanket. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1896.34s)]
*  But you know what. There's a fire and someone should be putting out this wet blanket instead of sitting around to think it's a birthday cake. No you're absolutely right. Even though it was very mean spirited. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1910.94s)]
*  Emily I guess the Dems are saying you should fight Trump harder. That's their solution. You've got to fight him harder. It seems to me that they'd rather do that than actually come up with solutions for various issues. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1923.94s)]
*  Well that's the whole thing. And I think the Seth Moulton clip really lays out exactly the hypocrisy where if they say things are existential if climate change is existential if President Trump is existential to this country then why would they why would they flip. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1935.94s)]
*  For example let's take Senator Mark Kelly. We talked about him last night. Right. If climate change was so important that he had to drive that electric car then why then would he go to diesel. The whole point is they exchange their values that they had in the moment for the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1954.94s)]
*  resistance because they hate Trump more than they were committed to any value to begin with. When you talk about the age of the Democrat Party to that just terrifies me because I think about the Vulture and the Illuminati and all of these things that essentially have been so baked into the fabric of our earth and beyond that there's no way they're going to. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1965.94s)]
*  This is this is a temporary death. And the resurrection is what might be more frightening. So I think right now to your point we are absolutely crowing because for once power has been restored to the hands of the American people. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1982.94s)]
*  But you're right that the level of fear and hatred and scorn coming out of the left now especially since it's at the hands of who they deem to be traitors people like Tulsi Gabbard and Elon Musk and even President Trump who used to be Democrats. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=1992.94s)]
*  What are they going to do now. They're going to rise bigger and better and better and more frightening. But that's why this dismantling chapter so important. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2006.94s)]
*  We have to make it so permanent so indestructible that they can't surmount that. But I'm not sure how to do that quite yet. All right. Well thank you Emily for that very powerful. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2014.94s)]
*  What up my Nazi. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2027.94s)]
*  I know you tell me. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2032.94s)]
*  That's our word. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2036.94s)]
*  That's our word. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2037.94s)]
*  When his whole white life for that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2041.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2046.94s)]
*  I don't even have a question. You know the Democratic Party is not going anywhere because we only have two options. Yeah. So even doesn't matter. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2048.94s)]
*  We've been around forever. Yeah because both parties do a good job of keeping a third party out. Right. So you won't see any. So what they do is every once in a while they change their face. So Democratic Party was overtaken by activists and want to be terrorists because it's funny because when. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2062.94s)]
*  And this is the difference between the two parties when Republicans are losing and being attacked i.e. when Facebook was taking everything you say your rights away when you said the wrong thing you lost your job. There was no reports of any of Facebook's buildings being burnt down or the windows being smashed in or any of his various businesses being attacked because that's not how we do things. We typically with extreme cases it's we believe in the Constitution and will protest or what. Even now we're busy because we work that we work too much. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2077.94s)]
*  We have jobs and we have investments we want to own property and we were chasing the American dream. So there's not a lot from the right in terms of attacking whereas the left they count on the people that they keep down that they convinced that it's coming and the reason why is not because we're screwing you over because all they really care about is being reelected. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2107.94s)]
*  That's all it's about so they continue to give scraps to the to the to the group that will do their bidding every one of those people that are going out and burning the tells us and all that stuff they think they're martyrs they think they're heroes because of the messaging but yet when they get arrested there's no one in the Democratic Party is going to be some punnets on TV they'll say all they want to talk about it but they're not going to save them. They don't mind sacrificing a few lamps for the overall good. That's when it comes down to one group can control all the it's the American people don't vote for the people. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2124.94s)]
*  They vote for somebody who supports people who blow buildings up and attack when things don't go their way. It should be very basic. Amen. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Q_7O8gDVI&t=2154.94s)]
