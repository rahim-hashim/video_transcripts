# Fox News Highlights - March 21, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight. Thank you, as always, for spending some time with us. So much for the norms. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=3.96s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. They wanted us to believe that they were patriots [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=9.24s)]
*  dedicated to saving democracy and stamping out all forms of political violence. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=16.96s)]
*  Those who perform these reprehensible acts cannot be called protesters. No, these were [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=24.1s)]
*  domestic terrorists. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=32.22s)]
*  When the threat that was metastasizing was the threat of white nationalists, domestic [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  terror. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=38.78s)]
*  The domestic threats we face in our country, we just have to draw a line in the sand and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=39.78s)]
*  say this can't be the way we move forward as a country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=45.22s)]
*  I love the hushed tones. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=52.42s)]
*  But as we saw in the Democrats' casual treatment of the George Floyd-inspired looting and destruction [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=55.02s)]
*  of our cities to today's coordinated attacks on Tesla, we know that there are certain acts [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=60.9s)]
*  of domestic terror they're always going to let slide. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=66.78s)]
*  Have you seen any of the top Democrats, I mean any of them, publicly condemn what's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=70.98s)]
*  happened to these dealerships? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=77.66s)]
*  Or the individual Tesla owners, what's happened to them? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=80.06s)]
*  Only a few of them have spoken out just recently after weeks of this violence. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=83.5s)]
*  But come on, ideological consistency is for saps. After all, they have a government efficiency [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=89.82s)]
*  operation to stop. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=96.1s)]
*  And man are they scrambling. They're scrambling to save their sacred cows of runaway federal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=98.42s)]
*  spending, woke governance and an unaccountable bureaucracy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=103.82s)]
*  That's what they have to protect. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=108.94s)]
*  Now if you sign on with the radical left, the ends always justify the means. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  And in this case, the end game is preventing Musk from exposing the systematic theft, waste, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=117.05999999999999s)]
*  abuse and corruption that is literally stealing hundreds of billions of dollars a year, maybe [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=124.13999999999999s)]
*  even more, from the American taxpayers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  If stopping Musk and Doge requires lawfare, they'll do lawfare. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=132.42s)]
*  If it requires that they launch a nationwide campaign of political violence against him [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=137.94s)]
*  and other pro-maga business leaders, they'll do that too. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=143.06s)]
*  They will stop at nothing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  Musk has a message for them though. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=150.5s)]
*  I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  They're like, what's going on? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=155.5s)]
*  Some people it's like, listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=158.77999999999997s)]
*  you don't have to burn it down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=161.42s)]
*  That's a bit unreasonable, you know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  Like, this is psycho. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=165.05999999999997s)]
*  Stop being psycho. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  Stop being psycho. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=171.7s)]
*  Good luck on that, Wish. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=172.7s)]
*  Now several of these moronic Tesla vandals have been arrested. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  They're just not very smart. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  But President Trump says that's just the beginning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=179.54s)]
*  He's going through a lot what they're doing to him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  And these people are going to be caught and they're going to be caught and they're going [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=186.94s)]
*  to be prosecuted. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=189.82s)]
*  They could get 20 years in jail and they'll get it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=190.98s)]
*  I'll tell you, there's going to be no leniency and there'll be no pardons. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=193.34s)]
*  It's under very serious investigation by the FBI and by the Justice Department. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=196.38s)]
*  As for those who claim that silent Democrat politicians bear no responsibility here, let's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  not forget what people like Tricky Dick Durbin was saying back in 2019 about a link between [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=208.98s)]
*  violence and heated language. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  A man went into a synagogue and killed one person, injured others. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=218.5s)]
*  Why is this happening? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  What do you see as the root cause here? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  This is domestic terrorism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=225.5s)]
*  Let's call it for what it is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  This has really been fomented because of the rhetoric that we're hearing from the White [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=228.5s)]
*  House. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  Ah, but the Democrats are absolved now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  After their rhetoric about Musk, the Nazi, the oligarch, the autocrat, Hitler. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  Now again, Democrats, they're so out of control. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  They're grasping at straws. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  They're even shredding their own norms. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=247.06s)]
*  EVs are great. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=249.5s)]
*  They may help with climate change. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=251.1s)]
*  Burn the Teslas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=254.02s)]
*  Or how about, we're for girl power. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=255.98s)]
*  But biological men must be allowed to compete in women's sports. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=258.94s)]
*  And now, political violence is always unacceptable, except when carried out by our own people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=263.38s)]
*  This is their pattern. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=272.58s)]
*  And we've now come to expect it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=273.58s)]
*  But how is that a way to build a strong, persuasive movement? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=283.26s)]
*  We just got a big upgrade. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=284.26s)]
*  I'm thrilled to announce that at my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=286.82s)]
*  with the world's first sixth generation fighter jet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  Number six, sixth generation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=296.56s)]
*  Nothing in the world comes even close to it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  We know every other plane. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=307.94s)]
*  I've seen every one of them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=309.3s)]
*  And it's not even close. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=311.42s)]
*  This is a next level. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=312.66s)]
*  You know, level five is good. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  This is level six. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  America's enemies will never see it coming. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=317.94s)]
*  Hopefully, we won't have to use it for that purpose, but you have to have it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=320.66s)]
*  And if it ever happens, they won't know what the hell hit them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=324.66s)]
*  Boeing says golden age like new fighter jets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=330.3s)]
*  The F-47, Trump says the generals picked the name, but okay. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  It's been 20 years since the F-22 debut and Boeing beat out Lockheed for the contract. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=338.82s)]
*  Here's Heg Seth. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=343.94s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, this is a big day. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=344.94s)]
*  This is a big day for our war fighters. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=347.54s)]
*  This is a big day for our country, a big day in the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=349.26s)]
*  The name of this program is the Next Generation of Air Dominance. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  And Mr. President, because of your leadership, your clarity, we are going to... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=357.7s)]
*  America is going to have a generation... [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=361.98s)]
*  Generations in the future of air dominance because of this sixth generation fighter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=364.1s)]
*  Mr. President, this is a gift to my kids and your kids, to my grandkids and your grandkids. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=370.78s)]
*  This is a historic investment in the American military, in the American industrial base, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=376.98s)]

*  We're all gonna be buying robots. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=579.3s)]
*  They're gonna cost about $30,000. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  You're gonna be buying a Tesla robot, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=583.02s)]
*  and anybody who doesn't buy a Tesla robot [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=584.62s)]

*  And humans are getting an upgrade too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=613.02s)]
*  I think long term we'll also have enhancement of humans, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=615.7s)]
*  or optionally if somebody wants to enhance, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=620.46s)]

*  maybe have super intelligence [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=631.98s)]
*  and be able to see in different wavelengths, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=633.4200000000001s)]

*  via Neuralink in the future. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=642.94s)]
*  So far it's been working well with monkeys. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=645.54s)]
*  He sticks a chip in their brain [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=647.9s)]

*  But if he can make humans smarter, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=651.9s)]
*  that's bad news for Democrats. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  You put a chip in their brain, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=655.3399999999999s)]
*  give them a little common sense. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=656.54s)]
*  Let's experiment. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=658.5799999999999s)]
*  Elon's Mr. Generosity. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=660.3399999999999s)]
*  He got Kai a cyber truck. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=662.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna win, watch this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=664.78s)]
*  Yeah, that was fast. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=670.86s)]
*  That was, that was. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=672.18s)]
*  So Elon got this one for me [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=673.86s)]
*  because they didn't make it at the time. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=675.62s)]
*  My grandpa like got me one. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=677.42s)]
*  He got me like the souped up version. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=678.86s)]
*  So it's 0.16, 2.6 seconds, which is insane. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=680.54s)]
*  Oh, is this 2.6 seconds? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=684.26s)]
*  2.6. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=685.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, then you'd be in 0.6 for sure. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=686.38s)]
*  So like my dad is, I think his car's like 3.2 seconds [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=687.82s)]
*  or whatever, smoked him. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=691.54s)]
*  Elon's building robots, saving astronauts [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=693.86s)]
*  and saving the government from going bankrupt. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=696.38s)]
*  Do the Democrats say thank you? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=699.02s)]
*  No, they call him Adolf. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=700.78s)]
*  The American people do not trust Elon Musk [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=703.66s)]
*  and Elon Musk is incompetent in his position. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=705.98s)]
*  He's a thief, he's a Nazi [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=709.34s)]

*  Voters don't trust fire marshal. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=715.1s)]
*  That's why they kicked him out of Congress. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=716.62s)]
*  Trump put together a cabinet of the best and brightest [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=718.9s)]
*  and in less than a hundred days, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=721.58s)]
*  we're getting new fighter jets, trillions invested here, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=722.82s)]

*  We have to band together, we have to speak out, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=734.02s)]
*  we have to push back, we have to show courage. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=737.34s)]
*  The dictator wannabes, this is part of their playbook [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=740.86s)]
*  and the only way to defeat it is by standing strong [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=744.9s)]
*  and saying basically, screw you, I won't be intimidated. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=747.54s)]
*  Democrats already sound defeated. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=751.38s)]
*  This is a long, relentless fight that we fight every day [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=754.22s)]
*  and I am confident that we will bring Trump's popularity, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=758.42s)]
*  numbers and strength down if we keep at it [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=762.26s)]
*  and keep at it and keep at it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=765.18s)]
*  Schumer's not fighting for Americans. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=767.5799999999999s)]
*  He's not even fighting for policies. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=769.3s)]

*  That's one reason why they lost. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=774.4599999999999s)]
*  They're fighting a person instead of fighting for the people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=776.2199999999999s)]
*  They keep saying, choose your fighter. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=780.02s)]
*  All right, I'll take Ivanka over Chuck any day. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=781.5799999999999s)]

*  Trump and his allies are aggressively attacking [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=801.38s)]
*  the players and machinery that power the left, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=803.38s)]
*  taking a series of highly partisan official actions [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=806.2199999999999s)]
*  that if successful will further their political interests. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=808.9s)]
*  And so, the Democrats are struggling [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=812.26s)]
*  because Trump's kicking down the pillars of liberalism, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  which if successful will threaten to hobble Democrats' ability [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=817.58s)]
*  to compete in elections for years to come. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=820.94s)]
*  Offense wins games, but defense wins championships. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=824.54s)]
*  Why do you think the right's so excited? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=828.42s)]
*  I keep thinking, okay, this is going to be it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=831.14s)]
*  This is going to change the way folks, they're gleeful. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=833.06s)]
*  Everybody I know who voted for Trump is gleeful [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=836.98s)]
*  and supportive of everything he's doing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=840.34s)]
*  It's not just Trump voters. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=842.26s)]
*  Most of the country's gleeful [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=843.3s)]
*  about the direction we're headed in. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=844.98s)]
*  In a recent post poll, it says 90% of Americans [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=847.02s)]
*  support deporting criminal migrants. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=850.1s)]
*  A majority of Americans want every illegal deported, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=852.6999999999999s)]
*  whether they committed a crime once they were here or not. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=855.66s)]
*  And 60% of you want to shrink the government. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=858.5799999999999s)]
*  The country's cozying up to Trump, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=862.54s)]
*  and the more Democrats attack him, the stronger he gets. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=864.66s)]
*  He never steps back. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=868.38s)]
*  He just sort of takes it like the centrifuge [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=869.46s)]
*  and then hurls it back at you. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  And he's been that way always. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=873.86s)]
*  This is just who he is. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=877.54s)]
*  This is who he is. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=878.54s)]
*  So those other people who attack him, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=879.62s)]
*  they think they're attacking him. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=881.86s)]
*  They're charging his battery. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=883.74s)]
*  They're literally charging his battery. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=885.22s)]
*  So he comes back bigger, stronger, bigger, stronger. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=887.14s)]
*  And once you understand the man, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=889.5s)]
*  the most intuitive person that you've ever met. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-yCX7xnoRg&t=892.14s)]
