# Fox News Highlights - April 10, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU)
*  Playing the long game. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=2.0s)]
*  The media and most of the Democrats, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=6.0s)]
*  did you sense what I sensed? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=8.0s)]
*  They were in a better mood today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=10.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=12.0s)]
*  Because the stock market went down by more than a thousand points. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=14.0s)]
*  Dow, Nasdaq, all down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=17.0s)]
*  Apple, down like 20% [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=19.0s)]
*  since Trump's inauguration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=21.0s)]
*  Nike, down 30% [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=23.0s)]
*  since Trump's inauguration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=25.0s)]
*  Has what's unfolded here [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=26.0s)]
*  fundamentally altered, for the worse, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=28.0s)]
*  the foundation of our global financial system? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=32.0s)]
*  We are looking at major losses this morning [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=35.0s)]
*  in an incredibly volatile stock market. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=38.0s)]
*  Are they secretly rooting for a recession? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=43.0s)]
*  Either that, or they're so consumed by their hatred of Donald Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=46.0s)]
*  and so unconcerned about the fate of the American middle class [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=50.0s)]
*  that they're just incapable of analyzing Trump's long-term plans [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=53.0s)]
*  to re-industrialize the economy and make trade fairer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=57.0s)]
*  Today Trump's message was, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=61.0s)]
*  everyone just take a breath, calm down, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=63.0s)]
*  let the process play out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=66.0s)]
*  We think we're doing very well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=68.0s)]
*  Again, there'll be a transition cost [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=70.0s)]
*  and transition problems, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=73.0s)]
*  but in the end it's going to be a beautiful thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=76.0s)]
*  We'll have some countries to get very big and very rich at our expense [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=79.0s)]
*  and not going to, can't let that happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=85.0s)]
*  It's not a sustainable formula. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=88.0s)]
*  No it is not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=91.0s)]
*  The U.S. will not remain a global superpower [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=93.0s)]
*  with a $36 trillion debt [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=96.0s)]
*  and with more than a trillion dollars in annual interest on that debt and growing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=98.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, at the same time, let our manufacturing capacity wither to nothing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=103.0s)]
*  because of horrid trade policies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=108.0s)]
*  So when Trump collects new tariffs, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=111.0s)]
*  what's going to happen with that money? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=114.0s)]
*  The money will be used wisely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=116.0s)]
*  Paying down national debt, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=119.0s)]
*  reducing taxes, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=122.0s)]
*  creating good budgets, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=124.0s)]
*  helping Christie with the border and all of the other things. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=126.0s)]
*  We built, I built hundreds of miles of wall as people now understand, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=129.0s)]
*  but we're going to beef it up and we're going to add more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=134.0s)]
*  Building a strong border. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah, check that off the list. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=140.0s)]
*  He's on it and the tariffs will help pay for it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=142.0s)]
*  Now watching President Trump take questions from the press for an hour during his cabinet meeting today, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=145.0s)]
*  I thought to myself, how did we survive four years of Joe Biden when cabinet meetings usually turned out like this? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=151.0s)]
*  All right. Well, good afternoon. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=158.0s)]
*  This could have been the week that catastrophic, catastrophic default happened. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=160.0s)]
*  We're putting millions of people's jobs in jeopardy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=167.0s)]
*  But good morning. I guess it's still morning, isn't it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=170.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=173.0s)]
*  And let's not forget when White House staff that had been covering up Biden's mental decline brought in Jill to change the story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=176.0s)]
*  It's time to write a new story of health care in this country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=184.0s)]
*  One where women get the answers we need, where the United States continues to be home to the most cutting edge research in the world and where everyone can lead healthier lives. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=188.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=202.0s)]
*  And then there was the old clap, then whisk the press out of the room trick. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=207.0s)]
*  Thank you, President. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=218.0s)]
*  Please don't let him answer any questions. Please don't answer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=221.0s)]
*  But now we have an administration that's actually keeping its eye on the prize and a president capable of doing that, of restoring American independence in the middle class. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=225.0s)]
*  And Trump is not letting anyone rattle him from day to day changes in the Dow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=235.0s)]
*  He's proceeding methodically, yet flexibly while working on key priorities. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=241.0s)]
*  And today we heard the good news on the Panama Canal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=246.0s)]
*  A framework for U.S. vessels first and free through the Panama Canal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=250.0s)]
*  And then also a memorandum of understanding with their security minister for the presence of U.S. troops jointly with Panama to secure the Panama Canal from Chinese influence. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=255.0s)]
*  China said too much influence. Obama and others let them creep in. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=267.0s)]
*  We, along with Panama, are pushing them out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=272.0s)]
*  And part of Trump's success with these trade deals will include getting other countries on the same page on the China trap. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=277.0s)]
*  Today's India Commerce, excuse me, today India's Commerce Minister sounded downright Trumpian. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=285.0s)]
*  This growth was fueled by unfair trade practices, happened at the cost of fair play. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=293.0s)]
*  And large parts of the world got carried into the narrative of low cost manufacturing, low cost goods coming from one particular geography. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=302.0s)]
*  But did not realize the long term impact that it would have at the global stage. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=313.0s)]
*  Bingo. And another positive sign for Trump and his approach. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=320.0s)]
*  The 10 countries that make up the Asian block of nations are also seeing the light. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=325.0s)]
*  Putting out a statement saying that they were, quote, united in the opinion that terror retaliation is not an option. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=331.0s)]
*  Even the pro-China New York Times had to admit that these nations, with their combined $228 billion trade surplus with the United States, don't have many cards to play against the administration. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=339.0s)]
*  Thailand's finance minister said, quote, we may have to comply. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=353.0s)]
*  So Trump's plan here is going to take some time, but it's working. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=358.0s)]
*  However, the press, of course, so predictable, they just seize on market gyrations. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=363.0s)]
*  Of course, the other win for America today was falling inflation down more than expected in March, which is good news across the board for consumers. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=369.0s)]
*  That, along with the jobs report from March, gives us just a taste of what's yet to come once these tariff talks are settled. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=379.0s)]
*  And speaking of settled, Trump got his party to settle their differences in his budget framework. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=386.0s)]
*  The House squeaked it through, and this paves the way for tax relief and more spending cuts, which need to happen and well above a trillion dollars needs to happen. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=392.0s)]
*  So if Republicans can deliver this without budget gimmicks, this will be another huge win for Trump and for America. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=402.0s)]
*  And then Doge's savings. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=410.0s)]
*  Well, they're estimated to be also big, and they're coming in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=413.0s)]
*  A dozen federal buildings have already been sold off with $20 billion saved in deferred maintenance, with many others set for sale. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=418.0s)]
*  Look, every dollar counts, but not to the Democrats, who are still crying foul. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=427.0s)]
*  Despite all their talk for wanting to cut wasteful spending, they're fine with wasting taxpayer money on vacant, useless buildings, because for them, the bureaucracy is sacred. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=433.0s)]
*  It's like a house of worship. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=445.0s)]
*  And Trump's fighting, of course, through all the lawfare. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=448.0s)]
*  And for the most part, he's winning. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=451.0s)]
*  In two major cases, the Supreme Court has voted with Trump's broad exercise of executive authority. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=453.0s)]
*  In one, the justices slapped down forum shopping and that challenge to Trump's deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, ruling that the statute may be used, but the illegals need some type of hearing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=460.0s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=471.0s)]
*  And another ruling, the court overturned a district court injunction that stalled the White House's decision to fire thousands of probationary federal workers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=472.0s)]
*  Now, that case may be a very good sign regarding Trump's other efforts to shrink the civil service. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=480.0s)]
*  So the usual suspects are hyperventilating. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=487.0s)]
*  They're naysaying and they're dismissing President Trump's goals. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=491.0s)]
*  And they just fulminate endlessly about disruption and chaos. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=495.0s)]
*  But consider this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=501.0s)]
*  Very few of them worried about the disruption that ripped through company towns all across America when they were devastated by globalization. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=503.0s)]
*  I'm just kind of shocked. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=512.0s)]
*  I can't believe this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=514.0s)]
*  After all we gave them, after all we done, and all the money we made them, they dropping a bomb on us like this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=516.0s)]
*  I thought I was going to retire from GM and it didn't work out that way. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=524.0s)]
*  So now I have to do something else. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=529.0s)]
*  I couldn't see myself going back to school. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=531.0s)]
*  You know, not after doing this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=533.0s)]
*  This has been my life. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=534.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a factory worker. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=536.0s)]
*  I'm proud of it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=538.0s)]
*  I have to go out here and reinvent myself at 45 years old. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=539.0s)]
*  You know, I've got a school diploma and this is all I know. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=543.0s)]
*  Where was the concern about that disruption and those heartbreaking stories? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=548.0s)]
*  So Trump here is playing the long game and those rooting for failure, hoping for a see I told you so moment are shorting our future. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=558.0s)]
*  And that's always a bad bet. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=567.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=570.0s)]
*  Season two of The Apprentice White House edition is off to a hot start. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=573.0s)]
*  Trump gathered the contestants into a cabinet meeting after a strong first quarter. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=576.0s)]
*  Everyone at this table is doing an incredible job, by the way, I have to say. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=581.0s)]
*  Incredible. And the relationships are it's like their friends. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=586.0s)]
*  There's really the relationships are very strong, really good, really strong. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=591.0s)]
*  And these meetings are very good. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=596.0s)]
*  No one's going home this episode. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=598.0s)]
*  Elon, though, he can leave at any time. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=600.0s)]
*  But Trump doesn't want him to because he's good for ratings. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=603.0s)]
*  Elon's done a fantastic job. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=607.0s)]
*  Look, he's sitting here and I don't care. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=609.0s)]
*  I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=612.0s)]
*  But I'm telling you, this guy, this guy did a fantastic job. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=615.0s)]
*  I don't need his car. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=619.0s)]
*  I actually bought one because and they said, oh, did you get a bargain? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=620.0s)]
*  No. I said, give me the top price. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=624.0s)]
*  I paid a lot of money for that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=626.0s)]
*  But honestly, he makes he makes a great car. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=628.0s)]
*  You know what I do with it? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=631.0s)]
*  I let the people in the office drive around in it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=632.0s)]
*  Sources say America's heartthrob Stephen Miller has been hogging the keys to the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=635.0s)]
*  boss's new whip. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=639.0s)]
*  Margot, Natalie and Chamberlain want to spend, but Miller won't let him drive. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=640.0s)]
*  Even if Elon leaves, the car stays. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=644.0s)]
*  And so does big balls. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=648.0s)]
*  Thanks to your fantastic leadership, this amazing cabinet, the very talented [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=649.0s)]
*  Doge team. I'm excited to announce that we anticipate savings in FY 26 from [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=655.0s)]
*  reduction of waste and fraud by one hundred and fifty billion dollars. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=660.0s)]
*  And I mean, and some of it is just absurd. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=664.0s)]
*  Like people getting unemployment insurance who haven't been born yet. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=667.0s)]
*  People are fantastic. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=671.0s)]
*  In fact, hopefully they'll stay around for the long haul. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=672.0s)]
*  We'd like to keep as many as we can. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=675.0s)]
*  They're great, smart, sharp, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=677.0s)]
*  Finding things that nobody would have thought of. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=680.0s)]
*  Very computer savvy. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=683.0s)]
*  Tech support's been working overtime to doze. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=685.0s)]
*  The billions were spending on a hundred percent organic shea butter and Burkina [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=687.0s)]
*  Faso. And of course, Moussa's in Nigeria. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=692.0s)]
*  And no one ever says thank you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=695.0s)]
*  They just mottled top his cars. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=697.0s)]
*  But don't worry, bond is on it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=698.0s)]
*  Your directive to me was to keep America safe. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=701.0s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=704.0s)]
*  You know, you also gave us a directive to prosecute the people who are going [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=705.0s)]
*  after Tesla to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=708.0s)]
*  Some of the greatest police work I've seen. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=710.0s)]
*  We've made four arrests. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=712.0s)]
*  There will be no negotiations at your directive. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=714.0s)]
*  They're all looking at 20 years in prison. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=716.0s)]
*  And within the next 24 hours, you're going to be seeing another huge arrest on a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=718.0s)]
*  Tesla dealership president. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=723.0s)]
*  And that that person will be looking at at least 20 years in prison with no [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=725.0s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=730.0s)]
*  We don't negotiate with Trantifa or Bad hombres. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=731.0s)]
*  Bondi and Cash seized 45,000 pounds in narcotics yesterday. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=734.0s)]
*  And the CIA is changing the rules of engagement. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=737.0s)]
*  The agency used to help arrest Cartel kingpins. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=740.0s)]
*  Now they're considering assassination. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=743.0s)]
*  And Bobby Kennedy says, don't change the channel. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=746.0s)]
*  By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=749.0s)]
*  We'll be able to eliminate those exposures. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=753.0s)]
*  So big. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=756.0s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=757.0s)]
*  So it was one in 10,000 children at autism. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=758.0s)]
*  And now it's one in 31. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=763.0s)]
*  There's got to be something artificial out there that's doing this. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=765.0s)]
*  So you think you're going to have a pretty good idea? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=768.0s)]
*  We will know by September. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=770.0s)]
*  There will be no bigger news conference. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=772.0s)]
*  The administration is going where no one's dared to go. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=774.0s)]
*  And when you work hard, there's prizes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=777.0s)]
*  I've had over 100 people working around the clock to scan the paper around [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=780.0s)]
*  RFK Senator Robert F. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=786.0s)]
*  Kennedy's assassination, as well as Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=788.0s)]
*  These have been sitting in boxes in storage for decades. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=792.0s)]
*  They have never been scanned or seen before. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=795.0s)]
*  We'll have those ready to release here within the next few days. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=797.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=800.0s)]
*  Bobby, how do you feel about that? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=801.0s)]
*  That's hitting close to home. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=806.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about Bobby when that statement's made. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=807.0s)]
*  I'm very grateful to him, Mr. President. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=810.0s)]
*  Assassination files have been sitting around in boxes collecting dust for [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=813.0s)]
*  decades, and we get to see them in a couple days. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=817.0s)]
*  That episode's going to be hard to top. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=820.0s)]
*  But head Seth gave it a shot. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=822.0s)]
*  We're getting the connection. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=824.0s)]
*  We just got back from Panama last night. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=826.0s)]
*  We were at the Panama Canal with their Southcom commander ships, F-18s troops, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=829.0s)]
*  and signed a couple of historic deals. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=834.0s)]
*  And then also a memorandum of understanding with their security minister for the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=836.0s)]
*  presence of U.S. troops. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=842.0s)]
*  Fort Sherman is an old U.S. base there, as well as a naval station and air [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=844.0s)]
*  station jointly with Panama to support the peace of Panama. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=848.0s)]
*  That's something you said. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=852.0s)]
*  We're taking back the canal. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=853.0s)]
*  China's had too much influence. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=855.0s)]
*  Obama and others let them creep in. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=857.0s)]
*  We, along with Panama, are pushing them out, sir. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=860.0s)]
*  Jose, this is a memorandum of understanding. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=863.0s)]
*  It means you understand it's ours. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=866.0s)]
*  Comprende? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=868.0s)]
*  Pistol Pete booted China from Panama. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=870.0s)]
*  He didn't even need the Navy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=872.0s)]
*  But next time, it might not be that easy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=874.0s)]
*  We're going to have to do something about it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=876.0s)]
*  Last year, the Chinese received 1,700 orders for new ships. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=878.0s)]
*  American shipyards received five. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=882.0s)]
*  Under your leadership, like so many other industries, we are going to revitalize [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=884.0s)]
*  and make shipbuilding and maritime great again. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=889.0s)]
*  We're going to start the process of rebuilding. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=892.0s)]
*  We don't really essentially build ships anymore, which is ridiculous. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=895.0s)]
*  We're going to build ships in the future. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=900.0s)]
*  We're going to build ships in the future. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=902.0s)]
*  We're going to build ships in the future. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=905.0s)]
*  We essentially build ships anymore, which is ridiculous. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=907.0s)]
*  It's going to be a very big business for us, and then not too distant in the future. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=911.0s)]
*  To build ships, you also need mariners to sail those ships. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=915.0s)]
*  You have to invest in sailors. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=918.0s)]
*  And I appreciate you taking the initiative to be a global power. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=920.0s)]
*  Team Trump's committed to breaking China's stranglehold on the West. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=924.0s)]
*  It's a two-punch combo, military and economic. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=927.0s)]
*  It does off beyond anybody, nobody. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=931.0s)]
*  How people stood for it, sitting in my position, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=934.68s)]
*  is not even believable. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=938.16s)]
*  And we're talking about many presidents, not just a couple. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=940.44s)]
*  But they did, and all we're doing [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=944.56s)]
*  is putting it back in shape. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=947.28s)]
*  We're resetting the table. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=948.56s)]
*  The Chinese won't lose face, so they're [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=950.08s)]
*  ratcheting up retaliatory tariffs [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=951.88s)]
*  and flirting with banning mineral exports. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=953.84s)]
*  But it's early on in the escalation ladder, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=956.48s)]
*  so they're just banning Hollywood. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=958.68s)]
*  China retaliated today by reducing [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=961.0s)]
*  the number of American films that can be shown there. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=963.28s)]
*  What's your reaction to them now targeting [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=966.28s)]
*  cultural exports from the United States? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=969.0s)]
*  I think I've heard of worse things. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=971.0799999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=973.12s)]
*  No. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=974.12s)]
*  No. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=974.92s)]
*  What's Hollywood going to do if Beijing can't see Clooney [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=976.92s)]
*  movies? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=979.2399999999999s)]
*  Stage another coup? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=980.04s)]
*  Today, tariffs on China hit 145%. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=981.9599999999999s)]

*  Your directive to me was to keep America safe, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=1492.0s)]

*  And no more under your directive. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEi-6OlyLU&t=1508.4s)]
