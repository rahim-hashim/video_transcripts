# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 11, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ)
*  Ending global welfare. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. The globalists gathered in Paris and they got a friendly but firm earful today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=5.4s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance had a message to world leaders about America's plans regarding the future of A.I. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=11.24s)]
*  The simple message. If you want our business you're going to have to treat us right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=18.2s)]
*  We'll work with you but don't think of taking advantage of us or bullying American corporations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=23.76s)]
*  The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=30.48s)]
*  tech companies with international footprints. Now America cannot and will not accept that. And we think it's a terrible mistake [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=38.0s)]
*  not just for the United States of America but for your own countries. I love when they pan to the faces the grim faces. We used [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=46.2s)]
*  to be able to take advantage of Joe Biden but not you. Well what specifically was Vance referring to there. Many of our most [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=53.92s)]
*  productive tech companies are forced to deal with the EU's Digital Services Act and the massive regulations it created about [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=61.64s)]
*  taking down content and policing so-called misinformation. And of course we want to ensure the Internet is a safe place. But it is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the Internet. And it is something quite different to prevent a grown man [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=77.72s)]
*  or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation. It's about time that a U.S. official called out [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=84.96s)]
*  Europe's attack on free speech right to their faces. Look the Europeans aren't even trying to pretend at this point. Officials [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=92.72s)]
*  there are openly calling for censorship of American social media companies including X and Metta. And back in August remember when Musk [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=100.6s)]
*  was about to interview then candidate Donald Trump on X an EU commissioner warned about a risk of amplification of potentially harmful [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=109.0s)]
*  content. At the time I was thinking harmful to whom. Well to the global bureaucrats of course. So why should American taxpayers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=117.16s)]
*  continue to subsidize this to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in defense costs when countries that don't protect basic freedoms in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=126.68s)]
*  their own countries continue on. Well our new defense secretary Pete Hegseth also overseas had another blunt message for our allies. Time to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  ramp up your military spending and do more to defend yourselves. The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression but it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=145.32s)]
*  ought be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that collective individual and collective defense. The president talks a lot about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=153.4s)]
*  common sense is you defend your neighborhood and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense. Most NATO countries are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  already close to 2 percent. We believe that needs to be higher. Yeah. In other words the free ride is over kids. It's been 80 years since [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=168.6s)]
*  World War 2 ended and America is up to her ears in debt. Friends don't let friends drive drunk and friends don't let friends mooch off of them [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=177.72s)]
*  forever. But to the old foreign policy establishment asking Europe to do more it's always considered an insult and even dangerous because it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=186.96s)]
*  plays into Putin's hands. Don't you know. Well that's absurd. It's out of step with what most Americans want at this point. But then again the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=197.24s)]
*  old guard is so used to foreign policy failure and running roughshod over what the American people actually want that they really can't relate to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=204.68s)]
*  this innovative approach. Thus when Trump floats the idea of taking back the Panama Canal or even figure out a way to buy Greenland or taking [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  over Gaza heads explode. This is like a bully in the schoolyard looking around for someone small to push around. So far we've had Greenland [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=223.12s)]
*  and Denmark. We've had Canada and Mexico. This is autocratic behavior. Trump is threatening to further destabilize the region. It's just a disaster. It's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=233.16s)]
*  kind of a it's a it's a disgrace. He's humiliating our allies. It's a disgrace. But is a U.S. led rebuild of Gaza any crazier than sticking with the status quo. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=241.8s)]
*  Do they have any ideas for how to deal with that. And how is continuing a massive trade deficit with Canada fair given how much security we provide them. And how is it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=254.28s)]
*  not insane to give China a foothold in a major shipping lane that we paid for. So if there's one unifying theme behind Trump's approach to other countries it's this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=264.92s)]
*  You're not going to rip us off any longer and you won't get something for nothing. We were paying almost all of NATO. It was unfair. We take care of the military and then they take advantage of us on trade. You know they're very tough. I'll tell you what the EU on trade is is horrible. Canada is just about the lowest payer in the whole thing which is very unfair. You know why they're low payer because they think the United States is going to take care of them. You think that's fair. It's not fair. And Ukraine also will need to pay up for the hundreds of billions we [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=275.84s)]
*  spent there. Trump Treasury Secretary Scott Besson is headed to Ukraine for a frank discussion. They have tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earth in terms of oil and gas in terms of other things. I want to have our money secured because we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. I told them that I want the equivalent like five hundred billion dollars worth of rare earth. And they've essentially agreed to do that. So it's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=305.84s)]
*  I expect a lot of wailing from the free riders and the defenders of the free riders as President Trump puts America first and as he methodically restores balance to our relationships around the world with pragmatism. But in the end Europe Mexico South America Australia they're going to have to decide whether they wish to partner with the United States or be run over by China. Trump's betting they're going to choose to stick with us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=335.84s)]
*  And of course he's right. And that's the angle. She should have taken the buyout. Mary Comans just got dozed. The CFO of FEMA got caught going behind Trump's back. 47 signed an executive order that was very clear. And this lady says watch this. I'm going to send 60 million bucks to Manhattan so Biden migrants can keep staying at luxury hotels. Musk caught her red handed. Mary should have known FEMA was on shaky ground. Trump just said the agency should be terminated. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=365.84s)]
*  Just last year FEMA got caught skipping homes with Trump yard signs. And Mary thought it'd be a good idea to sneak 60 million the migrants. Trump's famous for saying you're fired. This lady's out of her mind. And now she's out of a job. Read the room Mary. The whole government's being audited. The Department of Education is being actively dismantled. The dozers are in the building on the sixth floor canceling grants and contracts. Nearly a billion [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=395.84s)]
*  dollars of wasteful contracts were ripped up yesterday. Like this one a contractor was paid one point five million to observe mailing and clerical operations at one mail center. Sky was observing mail being opened and being sent for one point five mil. This is the kind of no show job a mob boss gives their cousin. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=425.84s)]
*  Those also terminated 29 DEI training programs at the Department of Education worth over a hundred million dollars. That comes to three point five million for each training program. Most of you've gone through DEI training programs or what in with H.R. for an hour. Maybe it's just an online course. Cha-ching. Three and a half mil. What. I should have been a DEI trainer. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=449.84s)]
*  I'm a DEI consultant. One DEI session trained teachers to force students to recognize their privilege and their history of oppression. Half the classroom can't read but this is what they're doing. Those just shredded 18 contracts at the Department of Agriculture. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=479.84s)]
*  One of them was for Central American Gender Assessment Consultant Services. We're paying a guy in El Salvador to assess gender. What does that have to do with agriculture. Here's another one. Forest and Gender Consultant Services in Brazil or this the women in Forest Carbon Initiative mentorship [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=498.84s)]
*  program. You go girl. Elon says Doge also canceled a 17 million dollar contract to provide tax policy advice to Liberia. 17 million to help Africans do their taxes. We even paid college tuition for Al Qaeda. We gave a jihadi a full ride to Colorado State. Here's how the shell game works. You get taxed. Congress sends your money to a federal agency. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=521.84s)]
*  The agency sends it to a Democrat nonprofit. The nonprofit president takes a fat salary sends some of it to a subcontractor and donates the rest to Democrats. I see a lot of kickback here. There's a lot of kickbacks. Tremendous kickback because nobody could be so stupid to give out some of these contracts. So he has to get a kickback. So that's what I got elected for that and borders and military and a lot of things. But this is a big part of it. And I hope that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=551.84s)]
*  the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do. We got elected to do among other things. Find all of this fraud abuse. We're thirty six trillion dollars in debt. Money's flying out the window. None of the departments can pass an audit. The reason that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=581.84s)]
*  departments can't pass audits is because the payments don't have a categorization code. It's like just a massive number of blank checks just flying out the building. So you can't reconcile blank checks. You've got a common fields that are also blanks. You don't know why the payment was made. And then we've got this truly absurd. A do not pay list which can take up to a year before an organization to get on the do not pay list. And this we're talking about terrorist organizations. We're talking about known fraudsters known [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=600.28s)]
*  aspects of waste known things that do not match any congressional appropriation can take up to a year to get on the list. And even what's on the list the list is not used. It's mind blowing. We're literally sending out blank checks that no one can track with no explanation. It's like the systems designed to perpetuate fraud from USAID to Social Security. It's crazy things like just cursory examination of Social Security. And we've got people in there that one hundred and fifty years old. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=630.28s)]
*  Not you know anyone. I don't. OK. This should be on the Guinness Book of World Records. They're missing out. So you know that's the case where like I think they're probably dead. It's my guess. Or they should be very famous. One of the two. And then that a whole bunch of Social Security payments where there's no identified identifying information. Why is there no identifying information. Why did it take Musk to find out all this fraud. Social Security administrators are [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=660.28s)]
*  dealing. How should I say this nicely with people who are about to die. Shouldn't they know around when people usually die. If you're still sending checks to one hundred and fifty year old nothing rings a bell. If the check hasn't been cashed in 50 years that's a problem. And if the check has been cashed that's a problem. Here's why nothing's ever done. Listen really everything is geared towards complaint and minimization. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=690.28s)]
*  So that's that. Then you understand the motivations. So if people receive money they don't complain obviously. But if people don't receive money they do complain. And the fraudsters complain the loudest and the fastest. They approve all the payments at Treasury. Because if you approve all the payments you don't get complaints. But now now we're saying that no actually we are going to complain if money is spent badly if your taxpayer dollars are not spent in a sensible and prugal manner then [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=720.28s)]
*  that's not OK. Your tax dollars need to be spent wisely on things that matter to the people. I mean these things like it's just common sense. The complaint system runs Washington. Any time you try to cut anything the Democrats the media the lobbyists the NGOs they all complain. So for about a century [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=750.28s)]
*  Washington's basically like OK OK OK. We'll just keep sending the money. Washington forgot how to say no. And now every woman in the Amazon rainforest who claims they're a climate consultant gets your money. Do you ever wonder how people work for the government and get so rich. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=770.28s)]
*  We do find it sort of rather odd that you know there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have an extensively a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth. While they are in that position which is you know what happened to USAID. We're just curious as to where it came from. Mysteriously they get wealthy. We don't know why. Where did it come from. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=790.6s)]
*  And I think the reality is that they're getting wealthy at taxpayer expense. That's that's the best. The honest truth of it. Millions of bureaucrats were working for the federal government working from home. And they never wanted to leave. I wonder why. One reason is because they have it too good. But there was another reason they weren't allowed to leave. This is actually a great anecdote because we're told that the most number of people that could retire possibly in a month is 10,000. Well that's a lot of people. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=817.68s)]
*  Like well why why is that. Well because all that the repart all the retirement paperwork is manual on paper. It's manually calculated then written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down a mine. And like what do you mean a mine. Like yeah there's a limestone mine. We restore all the retirement paperwork. And the limiting factor is the speed at which the mine shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal federal government. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=847.68s)]
*  And the elevator breaks down and sometimes and then you can't nobody can retire. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=875.76s)]
*  Doesn't that sound crazy. It's like a thousand people that work on this. So I think if we take those people and say like you know what instead of working in a mine shaft and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  carrying Manila envelopes to boxes in the mine shaft you could do practically anything else and you would add to the goods and services of the United States in a more useful way. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=890.92s)]
*  Here's the government mine where we house our paperwork because we won't computerize it like the rest of the world. We have 700 people working in an underground tunnel. What are we Hamas. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=906.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not like it's a top secret bunker. It's just where we keep Mark McGonigal's retirement folder from the Department of Commerce. How are we just finding out about this. There wasn't one whistleblower who was like hey [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=918.96s)]
*  Washington Post. I commute to work down a 200 foot mine shaft every day and there's no computers down here. We do everything with a big pen. I can't breathe and my hands falling off. I'm literally being shafted. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  Didn't we pass labor laws in the 40s against this and Democrats are supposed to be pro labor. Shouldn't they want to save these workers from these backwards conditions. No the Democrats want to keep the limestone mine open. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=945.0s)]
*  Which side are you on. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=960.84s)]
*  We'll fight against. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=963.84s)]
*  We'll fight. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=965.84s)]
*  We'll fight. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=967.84s)]
*  No we let's get within our walls. We'll fight from dawn to dusk. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=969.84s)]
*  Which side are you on. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=976.84s)]
*  Which side are you on. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=979.84s)]
*  Which side are you on. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=983.84s)]
*  Which side are you on. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=986.84s)]
*  Trump's coming for our unions. He wants us all to fail. He wants us to to bow to him. But we want him in jail. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=989.84s)]
*  Musk wants to rescue these government gremlins from working underground. And what do they want. They want to throw them in jail. Or they just scream. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1002.84s)]
*  We are all willing to work with anyone who's serious about doing the work of censoring the American people and advancing progress. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1014.84s)]
*  And for every American who doesn't want some weird Elon Musk suck up. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1025.84s)]
*  That Elon Musk needs to keep his grubby hands his greedy grubby hands off of our government. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1031.84s)]
*  Situation seemed hopeless in the heart of the Jim Crow sub. KKK was very active. Situation seemed hopeless. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1037.84s)]
*  And I'll tell you I'm from Jersey so I look a little differently. I say Trump. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1046.84s)]
*  I don't swear in public very well but we have to f*** Trump. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1051.84s)]
*  The Democrats just came out as pro-Monshaft and pro-terrorist tuition and pro-blank check. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1057.84s)]
*  Musk and his teenage deputy big balls are saving us a billion dollars a day. A billion a day. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1065.84s)]
*  And have uncovered what could be the biggest kickback scheme in American history. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1072.84s)]
*  And the media wants his head on a platter. Or something else on a platter. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1076.84s)]
*  Democrats are in the minority so you have only so much leverage. Have you all essentially made it clear to Mike Johnson that until they allow you all to subpoena big balls and the normalized Indian hate guy at least subpoena them and or subpoena Elon Musk. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1080.84s)]
*  Democrats are judge shopping and getting liberal justices to rule against Trump for finding fraud. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1097.84s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars in waste fraud and abuse. And I think it's very important and that's one of the reasons I got elected. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1104.84s)]
*  I say we're going to do that. Nobody had any idea it was that bad that sick and that corrupt. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1113.84s)]
*  And it seems hard to believe that judges want to try and stop us from looking for corruption especially when we found hundreds of millions of dollars worth much more than that in just a short period of time. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1119.84s)]
*  We want to weed out the corruption and it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1131.84s)]
*  Well so maybe we have to look at the judges because that's very serious. I think it's a very serious violation. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1137.84s)]
*  Bill Clinton Al Gore Barack Obama Democrats used to be about modernizing government and fighting corruption. So did the media. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1144.84s)]
*  If I give you a billion dollars and you can't tell me what happened to it that to me is wasteful that that means you are not necessarily responsible. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1153.84s)]
*  But if you can't tell me where it went then what am I supposed to think. And when there has been reporting I mean this is not like I'm not I'm not saying this is on you and that you cause this. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1162.84s)]
*  But I think it's it's a tough argument to make that cause it an eight hundred and fifty billion dollar budget to an organization that can't pass an audit and tell you where that money went. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1175.84s)]
*  Like I think most people would consider that somewhere in the realm of waste fraud or abuse because they would wonder why that money isn't well accounted for. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1187.84s)]
*  Anyone standing in the way of Doge tells me they might be on the take or they're benefiting from a wicked system. Democrats just got slaughtered in every battleground for putting illegals over citizens teacher unions over students criminals over victims transgenders over girls. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1199.84s)]
*  And the first war they waged against Trump puts corrupt bureaucrats over hardworking taxpayers. Good luck with that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1218.84s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and breaking tonight. Guess what President Trump just secured the release of yet another American hostage. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1227.84s)]
*  This is the seventh U.S. citizen that is freed under Donald Trump not including hostages that were released in Israel by Hamas. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1233.84s)]
*  Now only hours ago a teacher named Mark Fogel who was wrongfully imprisoned in Russia during Joe Biden's presidency is now a free man. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1242.84s)]
*  He is set to appear at the White House in just a matter of minutes. When that happens we'll bring it to you live. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1250.84s)]
*  And thanks to negotiations by Donald Trump and his special Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff the United States ended up giving up nothing in exchange for Mark Fogel's release. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1255.84s)]
*  According to national security adviser Mike Waltz quote this was a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1267.84s)]
*  Now I'm sure the Democrats the media they'll all be praising the president's strength to make this deal happen and thanking him. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1279.84s)]
*  But seriously don't expect any accolades from the Democratic Party or the state run legacy media mob. Democrats learn nothing after the election in November 24 and now seemingly only care about three things. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1288.84s)]
*  They want biological men playing women's sports. They want to protect criminal illegal immigrants who do not respect our borders our law our sovereignty even though murderers rapists cartel members gang members. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1300.84s)]
*  None of that matters known terrorists in our country and maybe most of all they really want to keep spending tens and hundreds of billions of your hard earned tax dollars on radical extreme left wing causes around the world without any audit. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1313.84s)]
*  No accountability and the hysteria over Doge and Elon Musk has been off the charts. Just to be clear the left is absolutely outraged that Elon Musk and his team working for free are rooting out waste fraud abuse and corruption inside your federal government. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1329.84s)]
*  Your money being wasted throw down the drain instead of being spent on schools and law and order and you know a better country for the American people lower taxes. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1347.84s)]
*  This is what the American people voted for. This is what they're getting. Take a look. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1358.84s)]
*  The public voted. We have a majority of the public vote voting for President Trump. We won the House. We won the Senate. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1363.84s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform. There should be no doubt about that. That was on the campaign. The president spoke about that at every rally. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1375.84s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform and that's what people are going to get. They're going to get what they voted for. And a lot of times that you know people that don't get what they voted for. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1386.84s)]
*  But in this presidency they are going to get what they voted for. And that's what democracy is all about. Why do people hate Elon Musk. He's about to. He's about to save two astronauts that Joe Biden and Kamala abandoned for nearly 300 days in space. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1396.84s)]
*  He offered the people of North Carolina and Tennessee you know Starling for free because they needed an ability to communicate with others. He did the same thing for people in California after the wildfires. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1411.84s)]
*  Doge has now uncovered tens of billions of dollars worth of improper payments. This includes over 100 million for D.E.I. training grants at the Department of Education. Nine million for Central American quote gender assignment services in Latin America from the Department of Agriculture. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1425.84s)]
*  Figure that one out. Another one hundred and forty five million in D.E.I. contracts with the Department of Labor Transportation other institutions. And get this among all the other crazy far left expenditures uncovered at USAID. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1443.84s)]
*  A few years ago this organization also reportedly paid for notorious Al Qaeda terrorists member Anwar Al Alaki. Remember that guy. Apparently they paid for him to go to school at Colorado State University. Full ride compliments of you the American taxpayer. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1458.84s)]
*  And that's not all. Just take a look at your screen today. Doge discovered that the paperwork for federal employees. Look at this who retire is processed by hand 230 feet underground in an old limestone mine in Pennsylvania. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1475.84s)]
*  Now this you know cumbersome operation requires more than 200 employees. By the way there are something called computers. They may want to use them. Then we now have something called artificial intelligence. And they're obviously working at a snail's pace. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1491.84s)]
*  The paperwork opera operates on a backlog can take multiple months to process. And meanwhile for FEMA employees they were just fired for continuing in spite of the president's order to send taxpayer dollars to hotels in New York City for illegal immigrants. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1506.84s)]
*  Remember FEMA was putting illegal immigrants in four star hotels in New York City. That is literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars a night. People in North Carolina forced to sleep in tents in the middle of winter months after Hurricane Helene. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1522.84s)]
*  And as you can see this is all about accountability efficiency. But according to the Democrats the sky is falling. One notorious radical left wing pastor literally calling for violence. I hope the Secret Service is paying attention against Elon Musk telling his congregation we are on the verge of bloodshed and sometimes violence is necessary. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1538.84s)]
*  We'll run that for you later in the show. Other Democrats lashed out at President Trump. For example Maxine Dexter is now famous for wanting to quote bleep Donald Trump. We'll let you figure out the bleep. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1562.84s)]
*  I just I've been told I have 30 seconds so I am going to tell you that we do have to. I don't swear in public very well. We have to Trump. Please don't tell my children that I just did that. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1576.84s)]
*  OK. Apparently this is the latest talking point to from the Democratic Party. Take note. They all sound the same. Take a look. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1598.84s)]
*  I'll tell you I'm from Jersey so I look a little different. We are going to meet. I was going to say but no we're not. No I'm not going to say that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1607.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1620.84s)]
*  They're going to bleep Donald Trump. Oh that's so uplifting so inspiring so full of vision for the country. That's really going to help make your life better. And wait it gets more dumb for some reason. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1623.84s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Presley also announcing her support for censorship. Take a look. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1635.84s)]
*  Look let me tell you something. I'll take a bit of umbrage here. I'll speak on behalf of my colleagues. I think I can say we are all willing to work with anyone who's serious about doing the work of censoring the American people and advancing progress. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1640.84s)]
*  But they are not serious. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1656.84s)]
*  And of course what kind of left wing resistance movement would be complete without a little cringe worthy predictable singing. Join in shall you at home. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1658.84s)]
*  For our unions. He wants us all to fail. He wants us to to bow to him. But we want him in jail. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1688.84s)]
*  And last but certainly not least here is idiotic senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy whining to fake news CNN about the death of democracy. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1699.84s)]
*  All because Donald Trump Elon Musk and Doge are criticizing you know waste fraud abuse corruption and criticizing judicial overreach because what they can't do with the ballot box electorally what they can't do legislatively. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1709.84s)]
*  But what the Democrats always do they run to far left activist judges. Take a look. Senator Murphy as we look at the developments that have happened in the last 48 hours what are your concerns about this moment that we're out with the courts with the president and with the suggestion from two of his top advisors that that maybe they defy the courts rulings. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1724.84s)]
*  Yeah listen I mean this isn't hyperbole to say that we are staring the death of democracy in the eyes right now. The centerpiece of our democracy is that we observe court rulings. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1745.84s)]
*  No it's the death of a misappropriating the money of the people that work hard in this country that on average make only sixty six thousand dollars a year. It is using their money to advance your radical Green New Deal your woke ism your transgender ism your D.E.I. ism worldwide and not taking care of the American people first. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1759.84s)]
*  When this is all said and done I want to extrapolate out how much money every American could have gotten off their taxes if they didn't give this money and spend this money on this radical agenda. That's not the death of democracy. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1782.84s)]
*  That is the return to constitutional order. That is a return to the vision of our framers and founders limited government greater freedom. That is that is what America needs now more than anything. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1796.84s)]
*  Finally they've talked for decades about ending wait waste fraud and abuse. Now we're going to do it. Now this perpetual state of rage while at times entertaining it's getting a little hard to watch. The sky has been falling for 10 years since Donald Trump and Melania came down that escalator at Trump Tower. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1807.84s)]
*  And yet Trump has his highest approval numbers ever. Look at this a joint poll. Trafalgar. That's Robert Cahilly insider advantage. Matt Towery Trump up nine points. Again the American people voted for government and reform and for good reason. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1824.84s)]
*  It's been a train wreck in the Washington swamp for decades. Americans also wanting strong new leadership overseas. Once again promises made promises kept. And just listen to Jordan's King Abdullah earlier today at the White House. He seems very open to what the president is proposing for the Middle East. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1841.84s)]
*  Mr. President I truly believe that with all the challenges that we have in the Middle East that I finally see somebody that could take us across the finish line to bring stability peace and prosperity to all of us in the region. And it is I think our collective responsibility in the Middle East to continue to work with you to support you to achieve those lofty goals. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1860.84s)]
*  The president's proposal will go in. We'll clean out the rubble. We'll rebuild Gaza and we'll create tons of jobs and wealth for the people in the area so they can have better lives and we'll demilitarize the place. Oh what a radical idea. We'll have peace in the Middle East. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1881.84s)]
*  The king appeared open to the president's plan. America exceptionalism is making a comeback as a result the entire world. It will be a better place. And by the way make sure to check out the Gulf of America. If you look on Google Maps there it is the Gulf of America. They're getting it. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsxdu9kl6VQ&t=1899.84s)]
