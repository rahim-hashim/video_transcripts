*  And Chef Jose Andres, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=59.72s)]
*  who probably not a good idea to take a photo [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=62.6s)]

*  78 of Biden's executive actions gone [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=81.92s)]

*  didn't even have a chance to walk out to the podium [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=100.6s)]
*  because the president missed being out there so much. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=103.0s)]
*  Late this afternoon, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=106.84s)]
*  the president delivered a historic announcement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=107.76s)]
*  Together these world-leading technology giants [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=111.32s)]
*  are announcing the formation of Stargate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=113.92s)]
*  So put that name down in your books [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=117.92s)]
*  because I think you're gonna hear a lot about it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=120.44s)]
*  in the future. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  A new American company that will invest $500 billion [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  at least in AI infrastructure in the United States [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  and very quickly moving very rapidly, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  creating over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=134.72s)]
*  Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=138.56s)]
*  the physical and virtual infrastructure to power [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=141.92s)]
*  the next generation of advancements in AI [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  and this will include the construction [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=147.72s)]
*  of colossal data centers, very, very massive structures. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  I was in the real estate business, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=154.88s)]
*  these buildings, these are big, beautiful buildings [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=156.16s)]
*  that are gonna employ a lot of people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=158.72s)]
*  Larry Ellison from Oracle, Masayoshi from SoftBank [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=160.64s)]
*  and Sam Altman from OpenAI. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=164.0s)]
*  We're in the Roosevelt Room [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=166.92s)]
*  pledging a half a trillion dollar investment in American AI. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=168.0s)]
*  But the oligarchs that Biden warned us about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=171.76s)]
*  are promising to cure cancer, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=174.32s)]
*  something Biden promised but never did. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=176.64s)]
*  You can do early cancer detection with a blood test [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=180.6s)]
*  and using AI to look at the blood test, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=185.6s)]
*  you can find the cancers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=190.12s)]
*  that are actually seriously threatening the person. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump's election created a ripe environment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=195.32s)]
*  to make major scientific breakthroughs [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  because his tax, energy and regulatory policies are perfect. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=200.0s)]
*  I'm thrilled we get to do this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=204.36s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=205.72s)]
*  I think this will be the most important project of this era [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=207.12s)]
*  and as Masa said, for AGI to get built here, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=209.96s)]
*  to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=212.72s)]
*  to create a new industry centered here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=216.88s)]
*  The big difference here is that Biden taxed you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=219.36s)]
*  to give money away to his handpicked businesses. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=221.84s)]
*  But these are private businesses [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  investing their own money here in America. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=226.32s)]
*  We're not picking winners and losers with your money. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=228.76s)]
*  Today's a good day to bet on America. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=232.0s)]
*  I came to celebrate your winning [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  and promised that we will invest $100 billion. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=238.56s)]
*  And you told me, oh Masa, go for 200. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=243.16s)]
*  Now I came back with 500. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=248.84s)]
*  Because this is the, as you say yesterday, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  this is the beginning of golden age of America. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=257.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump's first full day back in office [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  and he seals a half a trillion dollar AI investment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  And the snipers in the media [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  didn't ask a single question about it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  They started off right where they left off in 2020, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=272.36s)]
*  trying to create a scandal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=275.24s)]
*  Do you intend to continue selling products [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  that benefit yourself personally while you're president? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=281.72s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it benefited. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=284.56s)]
*  I don't know where it is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know much about it other than I launched it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=288.12s)]
*  I heard it was very successful. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=290.6s)]
*  I haven't checked it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=291.88s)]
*  Where is it today? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=293.04s)]
*  How much? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=295.88s)]
*  Several billion dollars, it seems like, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=298.24s)]
*  in the last several days. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=299.92s)]
*  Several billion? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=301.6s)]
*  That's peanuts for these guys. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=302.44s)]
*  47 has a different demeanor. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=305.76s)]
*  He's calm and he's not getting baited into hostile exchanges [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=307.88s)]
*  and he's garnering a new era of respect. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=312.88s)]
*  He said, if you committed violence on January 6th, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=316.2s)]
*  obviously you should not be pardoned. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Why is your vice president wrong? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=321.32s)]
*  Well, only for one reason. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=323.08s)]
*  They've served years in jail. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  They should not have served, excuse me, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=327.8s)]
*  their lives have been ruined. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=330.12s)]
*  And in many cases, listen to me for a second, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=331.4s)]
*  stop interrupting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  We won this election in a landslide [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=335.24s)]
*  because the American public is tired of people like you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=337.24s)]
*  that are just one-sided, horrible people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=340.88s)]
*  Trump doesn't have time for gotcha questions [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=345.2s)]
*  about Jan 6th. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=347.44s)]
*  We're in a tech war with China, a proxy war with Russia, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=348.71999999999997s)]

*  So we're demanding that they turn the valve [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=355.0s)]
*  back toward Los Angeles right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=357.28s)]
*  It's not even believable that they haven't done it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=358.92s)]
*  Just so you know, they have a valve and it turns, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=361.24s)]
*  like think of a sink, but multiply it times, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=365.32s)]
*  many thousands of times the size of it, it's massive. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=367.88s)]
*  And you turn it back toward Los Angeles, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  why aren't they doing it? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=373.8s)]
*  They either have a death wish, they're stupid, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  or there's something else going on that we don't understand. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=378.36s)]
*  But we want the water that they're throwing away [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  to be used for California. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=385.16s)]
*  Trump's visiting North Carolina and California [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=388.92s)]
*  at the end of the week. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  So hopefully we'll solve some problems there [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=392.68s)]
*  and get our citizens back on their feet. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=394.52s)]
*  Even the New York Times recognizes the true power [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  of the Trump presidency. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=400.24s)]

*  Wiser about the use of power, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=406.68s)]
*  the newly sworn in president suggests that this time, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=408.6s)]
*  he will not take no for an answer, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=412.64s)]
*  whether in enacting an ambitious domestic agenda [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=414.72s)]

*  of the Cold War against the Soviets. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=425.6s)]
*  And the media is struggling [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=428.52s)]
*  just to find out how they're against it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  Democrats, instead of at this point, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=434.08s)]
*  if the Democrats brought me in, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=436.12s)]
*  instead of saying what Donald Trump is doing wrong [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=437.28s)]
*  and all the things wrong, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=439.44s)]

*  he is giving the people what they want. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=446.32s)]
*  We can wring our hands, he's putting on a show. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=449.08s)]
*  Democrats talked about the joy of running with it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  They're walking around, their chests are out, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=455.92s)]
*  they're feeling like winners, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=459.0s)]
*  and the Democrats feel like whiners and nerds, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=461.72s)]
*  and that's gotta change, that's gotta go upside down. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=466.36s)]
*  Mike Tyson and Jake Paul [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=469.48s)]

*  If they can get along, why can't the rest of us? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=482.16s)]
*  and tonight we are broadcasting live. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=483.0s)]
*  We are inside the beautiful U.S. Capitol building [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=484.68s)]
*  where Republicans now control both chambers of Congress, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=487.92s)]
*  and right now there is also a Republican in the White House, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=491.76s)]
*  which brings us to a major programming note. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  Tomorrow, 9 p.m. Eastern, join us right here on Hannity, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump's very first interview [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  from the Oval Office of his brand new term, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  A Time of Optimism, Hopefully a Golden Era in America, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=508.88s)]
*  as he talked about in his inaugural address. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=511.88s)]
*  Y'all excited about that? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=515.04s)]
*  We got members of Congress here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=516.16s)]
*  All right, we got a great crowd. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=518.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=520.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=523.32s)]
*  By the way, we are all counting on you, don't screw it up. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=525.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=528.84s)]
*  But tonight was really about Washington, the House, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=530.12s)]
*  the Senate, Speaker Mike Johnson is gonna join us, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=534.5s)]
*  along with dozens of other Republican lawmakers. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=538.24s)]
*  They are on a mission. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=540.92s)]
*  They have a very small majority. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  They have to work together [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=544.5799999999999s)]
*  with the newly sworn in president [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  to fix what is broken in the country, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=548.24s)]
*  and there's a lot broken, and of course put America first. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not an easy task. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=554.06s)]
*  Anything worthwhile is hard, and they hold a slim majority, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  and after Donald Trump's recent nominees are put in power, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=559.24s)]
*  the GOP will have at most a five vote edge over Democrats, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  but they start out with only a two to three vote majority, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=568.36s)]
*  so needless to say, if they wanna get anything done, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  unity of message, unity of purpose is gonna be critical, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=575.28s)]
*  it's gonna be important, and look at this poll [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=578.92s)]
*  we just got tonight from Insider Advantage, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=581.96s)]
*  that's Matt Tauer's group. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=584.12s)]
*  70% of Republican voters want lawmakers, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  all of you in this room with me tonight, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=589.52s)]
*  to pass Donald Trump's appointees and his agenda, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=591.72s)]
*  and they want you to work in unison. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  So let's be very clear, other than Senator John Fetterman, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=597.96s)]
*  I'm not really expecting a lot of help from the likes [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  of Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, AOC, the radical squad, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=605.24s)]
*  or any Democrat to cross the aisle [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=610.6s)]
*  and actually govern for the sake of the people in the country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  In fact, despite a landslide victory in the fall [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  for Donald Trump, the left is still vowing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=618.76s)]
*  to resist the president with the same level of drama, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=621.2s)]
*  hysteria that we've all come to expect. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=625.4000000000001s)]
*  This morning, a so-called bishop politicizing [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  an inaugural prayer service, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=630.76s)]
*  instead of offering a benediction for our country, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=632.68s)]
*  for our president, she goes on a far-left woke tirade [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=635.52s)]
*  in front of Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=639.64s)]
*  their families, their young children. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=642.04s)]
*  She made the service about her very own [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=644.0s)]
*  deranged political beliefs with a disgraceful prayer [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=646.0s)]
*  full of fear-mongering and division. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  Listen for yourself. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=653.28s)]
*  In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=655.68s)]
*  upon the people in our country. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  We're scared now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=665.64s)]
*  There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=668.64s)]
*  in Democratic, Republican, and independent families, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=672.4s)]
*  some who fear for their lives. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=678.52s)]
*  And the people, the people who pick our crops [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=682.5200000000001s)]
*  and clean our office buildings, they may not be citizens [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=687.2s)]
*  or have the proper documentation, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=691.84s)]
*  but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=695.32s)]
*  Well, if you come in the country illegally, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=700.44s)]
*  you didn't respect our laws, our borders, and our sovereignty, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  that would make you a criminal by definition. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=706.36s)]
*  Totally inappropriate and, in my view, disgraceful, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  but in every corner of Washington, D.C., [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  that is what Republicans are up against, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  and that is especially true for the state-run legacy media mob [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  that I argued died on November the 5th. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=721.52s)]
*  They have learned no lessons from the 2024 election. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=724.0s)]
*  They're still droning on and on and on [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=727.04s)]
*  about the end of the world as we know it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=730.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=732.04s)]
*  We're talking about an attempt to portray [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=733.24s)]
*  this peaceful transition of power [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  with people who were convicted in the insurrection attempt [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=738.68s)]
*  attending, with the person who fomented the coup [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=742.64s)]
*  being sworn in as president, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=748.24s)]
*  essentially a delay in the completion of the insurrection. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=749.56s)]
*  I believe that this idea of the institutions, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=753.64s)]
*  which the Bidens clearly, truly believe in, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  have been completely exposed by this election. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=759.72s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the nominee for Homeland Security [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=763.12s)]
*  next to Apple CEO Tim Cook. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=766.0s)]
*  How is this happening? Only in America. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=768.28s)]
*  How is this happening? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=770.28s)]
*  Why are people with tons of money up on the dais [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=771.72s)]
*  with cabinet nominees and family members? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=776.24s)]
*  It is a message. It is a message. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=780.48s)]
*  And I think they are up there for the very reason [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=784.12s)]
*  that you probably think they're up there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=787.16s)]
*  So the state-run legacy media mob [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=789.76s)]
*  also turned their sights on Donald Trump's biggest reporters, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=791.76s)]
*  despite voting for Obama and manufacturing electric cars [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=795.56s)]
*  and creating a new type of solar panel [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=799.8s)]
*  and bringing Internet to rural America [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=802.0s)]
*  and revolutionizing, by the way, space travel. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=804.96s)]
*  Oh, Elon Musk is a bad guy, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=807.6s)]
*  enemy number two for the legacy media. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  Is this the same Elon Musk that made a gesture at Trump's rally, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=813.0s)]
*  one that Democrats, we have videos and pictures of, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=817.92s)]
*  making the same gesture? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=820.84s)]
*  The guy that, you know, he's given his heart to a crowd, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=822.92s)]
*  so-called journalists, literally accusing him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=826.48s)]
*  They're back to Nazi, fascist, racist, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=829.76s)]
*  Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=832.48s)]
*  Here we go again. Take a look. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=834.56s)]
*  And, yes, that salute was evocative of things [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=836.96s)]
*  that we have seen through history. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=839.36s)]
*  It was quick. I think our viewers are smart, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=841.88s)]
*  and they can take a look at that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=844.84s)]
*  But it certainly was... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=846.52s)]
*  It's not something that you typically see [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=847.84s)]
*  in American political rallies, to put it that way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=849.2s)]
*  No, no, it was not something that you usually would see. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=851.16s)]
*  That was a Nazi salute, and he didn't just do it one time. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=854.32s)]
*  He did it twice for emphasis. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=857.88s)]
*  And if you talk to anyone that's historians, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=859.64s)]
*  folks that actually study the Nazis [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=862.4s)]
*  and study this actual kind of disgusting display, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=863.72s)]
*  will have been very clear that what that was. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=866.76s)]
*  And he should not just apologize, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=869.16s)]
*  he should be condemned for those kinds of actions. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=871.88s)]
*  So gross, disgusting, but more of what we can expect, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=874.0s)]
*  I think, from Elon Musk and Donald Trump. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=877.52s)]
*  What they don't like about Elon Musk [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=880.48s)]
*  is he's friends with Donald Trump. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=882.72s)]
*  Elon is pro-freedom, pro-humanity, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=884.48s)]
*  anti-censorship, anti-big government. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=887.12s)]
*  He spent millions to help the people [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=889.68s)]
*  in desperate need in North Carolina [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=891.84s)]
*  and people in California [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=893.84s)]
*  after those fires went out of control. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=895.36s)]
*  He's an immigrant to this country. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=897.76s)]
*  He built multiple major companies from the ground up. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=899.76s)]
*  He employs thousands and thousands of Americans [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=903.04s)]
*  from all backgrounds, races, religions, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=906.16s)]
*  only an idiot would call him a Nazi. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=909.28s)]
*  But that's what NBC News did. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=912.4s)]
*  And they obviously have not come to the realization [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=914.4s)]
*  that legacy media is dead. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=916.96s)]
*  Lying and peddling conspiracy theories [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=918.8s)]
*  will lead to a massive decline in viewership. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=921.92s)]
*  We see this unfolding in real time before our eyes. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=924.16s)]
*  But after the past 10 years, I think it's safe to say [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=927.12s)]
*  that there's no shortage of idiots [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=930.64s)]
*  doubling down on stupid in the media mob. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=932.52s)]
*  But their influence and their power is waning. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=935.6s)]
*  And all of you know it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=939.64s)]
*  And they want this Congress to enact [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=941.0s)]
*  Trump's America's First Agenda. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=943.0s)]
*  And tonight, I am joined by the people [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=945.24s)]
*  that will make that happen. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=948.12s)]
*  Many of the lawmakers responsible [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=949.48s)]
*  for getting this agenda across the finish line [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=951.8s)]
*  to help improve your lives, make your towns, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=954.76s)]
*  your cities more safe, more secure, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=957.56s)]
*  and to put more money in your family's pocket [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=959.88s)]
*  and make us the richest country on earth with energy. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7eyIwN4iU&t=962.68s)]
