# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 16, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE)
*  Everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1.04s)]
*  Thanks, as always, for joining us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=3.12s)]
*  A real president answers questions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=5.4s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=8.6s)]
*  All right, pop quiz. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=10.48s)]
*  How many hour plus long solo press conferences [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=13.56s)]
*  do you think Joe Biden has held in the past year? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=16.96s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=20.64s)]
*  All right, if he answered zero, you were correct. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=21.88s)]
*  Well, Trump's press conference today [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=24.48s)]
*  lasted nearly 70 minutes [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=26.16s)]
*  and started with some great news for America. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=27.88s)]
*  Today, I'm thrilled to announce that SoftBank [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  will be investing $100 billion in America, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=39.16s)]
*  And he's doing this because he feels very optimistic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=43.64s)]
*  about our country since the election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=46.76s)]
*  This historic investment is a monumental demonstration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  of confidence in America's future. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=52.72s)]
*  After four years of dealing with Biden, the bumbler in chief, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=56.04s)]
*  a pro-business America is back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=60.36s)]
*  And the Japanese CEO laid out all the details. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=63.44s)]
*  This is double of last time, because I say, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=66.52s)]
*  oh, President Trump is a double-down president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=71.76s)]
*  I'm going to have to double down, you know? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=74.68s)]
*  $100 billion and 100,000 jobs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=77.2s)]
*  I am truly excited to make this happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=80.48s)]
*  Wait, I thought Trump was going to destroy global relations, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=85.32s)]
*  offend our allies. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=89.08s)]
*  In fact, it's the opposite, of course. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=91.12s)]
*  But Trump spent the majority of the press conference [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=93.84s)]
*  fielding questions and seemed to be really enjoying himself. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=96.28s)]
*  Are you entertaining the idea of preemptive strikes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=99.84s)]
*  against Iran's nuclear facilities? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=102.28s)]
*  Am I going to do preemptive strikes? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=104.2s)]
*  Why would I say that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=106.64s)]
*  Can you imagine if I said yes or no, you'd say... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=107.92s)]
*  That was strange that he answered it that way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=112.48s)]
*  Am I going to do preemptive strikes on Iran? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=114.16s)]
*  Is that a serious question? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=118.28s)]
*  How could I answer a question like that? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=119.64s)]
*  100% though. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=122.96s)]
*  Who said Trump's not diplomatic? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Because that was a pretty dumb question. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  And of course, Trump's used to hearing that his deportation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=128.8s)]
*  plan is impractical. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=131.72s)]
*  Who's going to wait our tables? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=133.56s)]
*  Who's going to, you know, trim our lawns? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=135.16s)]
*  But he knows that America holds all the cards [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=137.6s)]
*  vis-a-vis other countries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=140.32s)]
*  In terms of your mass deportation plans, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  have you had any preliminary discussions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=144.6s)]
*  with countries like Venezuela, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  from where the Trinidad-Aragua gang is now popping up? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=148.0s)]
*  They'll take them back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  They're going to take them back? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  They're all taking them back, yep. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  And if they don't, they'll be met very harshly economically. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=155.64s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  A president who uses our economic power [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=161.64s)]
*  to help Americans and get other nations to help us too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=165.2s)]
*  Now, we're 36 trillion in debt, and the interest on the debt [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=168.88s)]
*  is about a trillion or so annually. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=171.76s)]
*  That's more than our defense budget. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  So Trump knows we need to move fast. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=175.28s)]
*  We'll soon unleash American energy, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=179.28s)]
*  and this will be done at levels not seen before, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  issuing quick approvals for pipelines, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=183.92s)]
*  drilling another infrastructure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=186.12s)]
*  And I'll keep my promise to pass historic tax cuts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=188.2s)]
*  for American families, workers, and businesses [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  that create jobs in America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=193.76s)]
*  A lot of businesses are going to come in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Between that and our taxing and tariff policies, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=197.6s)]
*  we're going to have business like nobody's ever seen [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=200.76s)]
*  in this country before. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=202.88s)]
*  Well, fixing our economy will not happen overnight, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=204.12s)]
*  and it will require a massive effort [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=207.04s)]
*  to save money and cut waste. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=209.64s)]
*  Through the Department of Government Deficiency, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk has been working very hard with various people, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  including Vivek, will go to eliminate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=218.88s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of wasted fraud. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=223.48s)]
*  And they're finding things that you wouldn't even believe. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  So we're looking to save maybe $2 trillion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=228.84s)]
*  Well, that would be amazing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  But to cut the pork, especially at the Pentagon, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=233.96s)]
*  Trump's going to need to go to war. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=236.6s)]
*  But, yeah, but actual wars, no. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=239.32s)]
*  Today, again, we saw Trump the peacemaker. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=241.28s)]
*  There's a light shining over the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=244.2s)]
*  We're trying to get the war stopped, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  that horrible, horrible war that's going on in Ukraine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=247.4s)]
*  Since the election, I've been working every day [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  to put the world at ease a little bit, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=253.76s)]
*  to get rid of the wars. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=256.64s)]
*  We had no wars when I left office, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=257.6s)]
*  and now the whole world is blowing up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=260.12s)]
*  Well, it's certainly blowing up for the hundreds of thousands [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=263.24s)]
*  of federal bureaucrats who have been on their duff [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=265.44s)]
*  since COVID working from home. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=267.8s)]
*  Trump had a message for them as well, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  for the Zoom and Phone It In crowd. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=272.56s)]
*  If people don't come back to work, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=276.48s)]
*  And somebody in the Biden administration [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=278.68s)]
*  gave a five-year waiver of that so that for five years, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=281.36s)]
*  people don't have to come back into the office. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  It was like a gift to a union, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=289.8s)]
*  And now, Trump also blew the whistle [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  on the Biden administration's wasteful and petty border moves. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=294.44s)]
*  The other thing is really terrible. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=299.12s)]
*  We spent a tremendous amount of money in building the wall, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=302.36s)]
*  and the administration is trying to sell it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  for five cents on the dollar, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=308.56s)]
*  knowing that we're getting ready to put it up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  That has nothing to do with a smooth transition. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  That has to do with people really trying to stop our nation. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=316.04s)]
*  So I'm asking today Joe Biden to please stop selling the wall. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  We're going to use that to create a strong barrier. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=324.48s)]
*  Well, I actually said please. That was surprising to me. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  The president-elect was so at ease in front of the media [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=333.8s)]
*  that it looked like he could have gone on for another hour. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=337.68s)]
*  What a refreshing change this is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=340.44s)]
*  from how the current occupant of the White House carried himself, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=342.12s)]
*  including on July 11th, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=345.48s)]
*  which was his last formal press conference, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=347.48s)]
*  which started this way. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  Now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=352.44s)]

*  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=359.6s)]
*  President Putin. He's going to be President Putin. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=362.8s)]
*  President Zelensky. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=366.0s)]
*  Aren't you going to miss that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=368.68s)]
*  And we got to the question part of the program. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=370.48s)]
*  Well, things didn't improve much. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=372.92s)]
*  What concerns do you have about Vice President Harris's ability [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=374.92s)]
*  to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=378.4s)]
*  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=381.92s)]
*  to be vice president [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=385.12s)]
*  until I think she was not qualified to be president. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=386.76s)]
*  Remember, the press was complicit all along [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=390.52s)]
*  in the cover-up of Biden's decline. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=393.28s)]
*  They knew how bad it was. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=395.36s)]
*  So to scratch back some of their credibility, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=397.24s)]
*  they'd have to admit they were wrong [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=399.88s)]
*  about all their false and dire predictions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump just blatantly vowing to abuse power [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=405.12s)]
*  to target American citizens as, quote, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=409.32s)]
*  enemies, threaten the free press. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=411.44s)]
*  For a lot of the post-colonists, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=413.56s)]
*  they believe Trump is a threat to the American free press [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=415.0s)]
*  and that he will impose draconian restrictions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=417.36s)]
*  And those fears are palpable in other newsrooms as well. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=419.88s)]
*  One freedom often taken for granted is under threat, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=422.24s)]
*  and that is freedom of the press. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=425.24s)]
*  Activist groups warn that Donald Trump's second term [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=427.44s)]
*  further endangers this essential right. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=430.68s)]
*  Oh, Christian, not having a front-row seat [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  in the briefing room isn't the same [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=436.88s)]
*  as losing your First Amendment rights. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=438.36s)]
*  This is always nonsense. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=440.72s)]
*  They have to be better than this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=442.64s)]
*  Trump has been the most transparent politician [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=444.88s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  He tells us what he thinks and he does what he says. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=449.08s)]
*  No one's perfect, but who's even come close? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=452.56s)]
*  He's never afraid to take questions [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=455.6s)]
*  from an adversarial press. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=457.08s)]
*  And today was just another reminder [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=458.8s)]
*  of the fun we're gonna have over the next four years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=464.4s)]
*  The president was in the house [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  for the Army-Navy game this weekend, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=466.68s)]
*  and we're not talking about Biden. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=468.68s)]
*  For the land of the free [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=471.36s)]
*  and the home of all the brave. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  We need you! [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=482.4s)]
*  145th contest between Army and Navy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  Our producers just found out Biden never attended [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=490.88s)]
*  an Army-Navy game as president. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=493.2s)]
*  It's kind of weird, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=495.0s)]
*  Maybe he was afraid of the boo-birds. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=496.56s)]
*  Anyway, 47 brought the whole crew, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=498.96s)]
*  JD, Elon, Vivek, Tulsi, Cash, and Hegseth. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=501.28s)]
*  Oh, and Pete brought his plus one, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=504.96s)]
*  Will Kane, his best friend. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Pete hasn't even been confirmed yet. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=510.2s)]
*  He's already recruiting. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=511.84s)]
*  He had a push-up contest with Vivek's son. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=513.4s)]
*  Okay, here we go, ready? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=516.92s)]
*  Get down. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=518.12s)]
*  Brother, get down. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  Get down. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=519.92s)]
*  More push-up. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=520.76s)]
*  Ready? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=522.0s)]
*  More push-up, buddy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=522.84s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=523.68s)]
*  Let's see more push-up. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=524.52s)]
*  There was a special guest at the game, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=526.52s)]
*  Daniel Penny, a free man. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=529.72s)]
*  Everybody in that shot knows what it's like [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=532.76s)]
*  to be wrongfully accused. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=534.64s)]
*  Remember, Democrats said Vance had sex with a couch. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=536.88s)]
*  Even Democrats wanted to watch the game with Trump, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  but the suite was locked. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=543.4s)]
*  So Democrat Governor Wes Moore had to wait in the hall [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  to shake 47's hand. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  Got his picture with the dictator, and now he's happy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=549.92s)]
*  And if they couldn't make it to the game, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=553.52s)]
*  they just flew down to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=555.64s)]
*  The CEO of the biggest venture capital firm in the world [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=557.76s)]
*  for tech, SoftBank, is making a big bet on America. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  My confidence level to the economy of the United States [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  has tremendously increased with his victory. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=572.36s)]
*  So because of that, I'm now excited to commit [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=576.96s)]
*  this hundred billion dollars and hundred thousand jobs [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=583.48s)]
*  into the United States. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  Not so fast, son. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=588.48s)]
*  They call it the art of the deal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna ask him right now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=592.84s)]
*  Would you make it $200 million? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  He said he can actually, believe it or not, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=597.88s)]
*  he can actually afford to do that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  Would you do that? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=603.4s)]
*  I will try to make it happen. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=604.68s)]
*  That's good. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, 200. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=607.16s)]
*  He'll make it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=608.68s)]
*  200 million investments. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=609.52s)]
*  He is a great negotiator. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=613.04s)]
*  Investors see SoftBank come in like this [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  and they wanna get into. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=619.76s)]
*  It's like when Pelosi buys a stock. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  You know what's going up. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=623.44s)]
*  The CEO of TikTok also stopped by Mar-a-Lago today [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=625.24s)]
*  and over the weekend, Apple CEO Tim Cook popped in for dinner. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  How was your meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=633.0s)]
*  I did have a dinner with Tim Cook. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  I had dinner with sort of almost all of them [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  and the rest are coming. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  And this is one of the big differences, I think, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=643.72s)]
*  between, we were talking about it before, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=646.0s)]
*  one of the big differences between the first term [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=649.1600000000001s)]
*  and the first term, everybody was fighting me. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=651.9599999999999s)]
*  In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=654.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  My personality changed or something. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=657.36s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg made the pilgrimage just a few weeks back [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  and sources say Trump had him stand up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=663.0s)]
*  with his hand to his heart [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=665.36s)]
*  while the January 6th choir sung the national anthem. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=666.68s)]
*  Remember Facebook banned Trump after Jan 6th [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  and now Trump sneaks in the J6 choir. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  So Zuckerberg has to stand. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  Power move. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=679.16s)]
*  Bezos is coming to dinner this week [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=680.6s)]
*  with his wife, Lauren Sanchez, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=682.36s)]
*  and all of these CEOs are giving Trump a million each [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=684.64s)]
*  for his inaugural. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  The winter White House has been getting flooded with calls [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=689.24s)]
*  from C-suite executives. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=691.96s)]
*  I've had the smartest people on Wall Street call me. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  They said, where'd you get that idea? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=696.76s)]
*  And it doesn't seem that complicated, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=698.72s)]
*  But it's nobody, it's like the paperclip. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  Nobody ever thought of it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=703.72s)]
*  One guy thought of it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=705.0s)]
*  Everybody looked at it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  They said, wow, that was a good idea. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=706.96s)]
*  Why didn't I think of it? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=709.88s)]
*  All the action takes place after dark. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=711.6s)]
*  Trump's a well-known night owl [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=714.04s)]
*  and revs up when the sun goes down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=715.8s)]
*  He's announcing nominations, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=718.12s)]

*  Which other world leaders [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=730.52s)]
*  have you invited to the inauguration? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=731.64s)]
*  The world leaders are calling me [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=734.48s)]
*  and some really would like to meet. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=736.2s)]
*  No, I mean, literally they're calling me [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=739.92s)]
*  and I'll be seeing some of them. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=742.84s)]
*  I think it's rude not to. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=746.32s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to say I'm not going to see you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=747.52s)]
*  And I've spoken to way over 100 [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=749.88s)]
*  where they called to congratulate on the — [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=753.96s)]
*  not only the election, but the size of the election, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=756.56s)]
*  the extent of the victory. And they were great. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=759.24s)]
*  I mean, I spoke to over 100 countries. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=762.72s)]
*  You wouldn't believe how many countries there are. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=765.12s)]
*  And I'm trying my best I can to get back to everybody. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=767.84s)]
*  If you're one of the countries [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=773.72s)]
*  that hasn't called to congratulate Trump yet, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=774.76s)]
*  don't think he doesn't notice Trump slucking diet cokes, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=777.32s)]

*  He just spoke to Netanyahu [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=788.12s)]
*  and has a warning for the whole Middle East. Listen. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=789.44s)]
*  We had a very good talk. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  We discussed what is going to happen. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=795.28s)]
*  And I'll be very available on January 20th. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=799.12s)]
*  And we'll see. As you know, I gave warning [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=804.84s)]
*  that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=808.32s)]
*  all hell's going to break out. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=811.04s)]
*  Trump's dangling carrots and sticks to friends and foes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=812.84s)]
*  Tariffs, airstrikes, investment deals, lawsuits. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=816.28s)]
*  While the man technically still president is sabotaging them. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=819.4s)]
*  We had we ordered an additional 200 miles of wall. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=823.6s)]
*  It's very expensive. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=828.0400000000001s)]
*  And now it's about double the price [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=829.4s)]
*  of what it would have been six years ago. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=831.24s)]
*  And the administration is trying to sell it for five cents [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  on the dollar, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  knowing that we're getting ready to put it up. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=839.12s)]
*  And what they're doing is really an act. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=842.48s)]
*  It's almost it's almost a criminal act. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=844.64s)]
*  They know we're going to use it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  And if we don't have it, we're going to have to rebuild it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=849.2s)]
*  And it'll cost double what it cost years ago. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's really that has nothing to do [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=858.08s)]
*  with a smooth trend transition. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=861.32s)]
*  That has to do with people really trying to stop our nation. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=863.76s)]
*  It's not just Joe Biden slowing things down. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  Republican senators still doing a lot of posturing [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=870.6s)]
*  over Trump's cabinet nominees. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=873.2s)]
*  The president-elect says it's time to stop the shenanigans. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=875.32s)]
*  Senators who oppose your nominees, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  your cabinet nominees, should they be primary? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=880.36s)]
*  If they are unreasonable, I'll give you a different answer, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=883.6s)]
*  an answer that you'll be shocked to hear. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=886.88s)]
*  If they're unreasonable, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=890.52s)]
*  if they're opposing somebody for political reasons [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=891.88s)]
*  or stupid reasons, I would say has nothing to do with me. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=895.16s)]
*  I would say they probably would be primary. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=899.2s)]
*  But if they're reasonable, fair, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=901.8000000000001s)]
*  and really disagree with something or somebody, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=904.52s)]
*  I could see that happening. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=906.76s)]
*  Trump's sticking to his people. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=908.36s)]
*  But he's telling his nominees [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=910.36s)]
*  they'll have less money and less headcount. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=911.88s)]
*  So he says he expects them to do more with less. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=914.24s)]
*  People close to him say he's following his instincts [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=917.44s)]
*  and isn't going to second-guess himself [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=919.88s)]
*  when Republican politicians beg him to be more cautious. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=921.6s)]
*  The typical people are lobbying him to go easy on tariffs [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=925.24s)]
*  and are angling for their own little carve-outs. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=928.48s)]
*  But Trump has a strategy, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=930.9200000000001s)]
*  and insiders say he's sticking to his guns. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=932.2s)]
*  Mitt Romney admits the days [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=935.12s)]
*  of the Republican establishment are over. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=936.96s)]
*  Get on the train or get tied to the tracks. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=940.0s)]
*  Donald Trump won. He won overwhelmingly. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=943.52s)]
*  He said what he was going to do, and that's what he's doing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=946.4s)]
*  You can't complain about someone [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  who does what he said he was going to do. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=950.24s)]
*  MAGA is the Republican Party, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=952.24s)]
*  and Donald Trump is the Republican Party today. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=953.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's popularity is at a seven-year high. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=956.76s)]
*  He knows it, and so does everyone else. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=959.84s)]
*  This is the difference between a shocking victory in 2016 [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=962.84s)]
*  and a commanding victory in 2024. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=966.08s)]
*  Still, some Democrats are boycotting the inauguration. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=969.44s)]
*  One Hispanic congresswoman says she doesn't feel safe coming [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=972.72s)]
*  with all the Trump supporters pouring in from the ceremony. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=976.44s)]
*  So they let millions of gangbangers into the country, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=980.04s)]
*  but she doesn't feel safe [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=982.16s)]
*  when a few American citizens come to D.C. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  And this just in, New York judge Juan Rishon [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=987.32s)]
*  is refusing to dismiss Trump's hush-money conviction, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=991.16s)]
*  even after the Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  Other Democrats are saying, just get over it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=997.92s)]
*  Trump outsmarted us, and the country's behind him. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1000.7199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is not an idiot. Donald Trump, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1004.64s)]
*  let me just be very clear. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1007.8399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is smarter than me, you, and all critics. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  You know why we know? This dude is a phenomenon. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1013.04s)]
*  He is the most powerful human on Earth and in our lifetime, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1016.3599999999999s)]
*  and we're still saying, well, how is this God? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1020.76s)]
*  We look like idiots to ordinary people. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1023.4s)]
*  He is to ordinary people. You're totally right. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1025.8s)]
*  Make America Great Again wasn't just a slogan. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1029.76s)]
*  It was always the mission. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dLNIE1MJNE&t=1032.12s)]
