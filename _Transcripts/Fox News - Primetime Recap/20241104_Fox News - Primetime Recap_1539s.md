# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 3, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg)
*  That is the America that Kamala Harris created and that the elites on the trail with her are celebrating tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=0.0s)]
*  As they all show, it's an utter disregard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's a callous disregard for the suffering of their fellow Americans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=10.84s)]
*  Man, it's just 48 hours from now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=17.28s)]
*  It's all in the line, my friends. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=18.92s)]
*  Returns are going to start trickling in and this long campaign will finally be over. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=20.28s)]
*  And perhaps I think the most salient predictor of Tuesday's outcome is the just released Right Track Wrong Track survey by ABC Ipsos. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=25.84s)]
*  74% of likely voters say they were seriously, things are seriously off track. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=35.4s)]
*  The most off track just before a presidential election since 2008. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=41.96s)]
*  And we know what happened to the incumbent party that year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=47.84s)]
*  And key is that 42% said they're less well off than they were when Biden took office. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=51.28s)]
*  Only 19% said that we're better off. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  Now, the worse off number is near historic lows going back to 1986. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  Now, you can see how this is happening in swing states. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=67.0s)]
*  In the Keystone state, voters have been hammered by high food costs. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=70.16s)]
*  Philly has seen the steepest increases in all of America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  But to those who say Trump, you know, Trump's going to turn it around, a top Kamala surrogate is saying, oh, no, you didn't. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  I believe her when she says under her buying eggs and milk won't break the bank because she's going to pass a ban on price gouging on groceries. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  And she told me that in my face. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=100.68s)]
*  So she better not lie to me in my face. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=102.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=105.8s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  But Kamala should change her name to Kamala. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=107.92s)]
*  Whether it's her lying about what Trump said about Charlottesville or about Biden's cognitive state before the debate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=111.56s)]
*  It's all been one nonstop fraud upon the American people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=118.08s)]
*  And I think she thinks that she could run out the clock with cliches and empty slogans or just by pretending she didn't hear questions or ignoring them altogether. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=123.24s)]
*  Now, consider California's Prop 36, which is on the ballot and would crack down on retail theft, upping the punishment for criminals that were getting off essentially scot free from liberal policies, liberal laws. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=134.56s)]
*  Now, it's hugely popular, this initiative with 73 percent of Californians supporting it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=147.4s)]
*  Can't get any anyone to agree to 73 percent anything these days. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=153.24s)]
*  But what happened when Kamala, who used to be AG of California, was asked about her views on the proposition? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  How did you vote on Prop 36? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=164.44s)]
*  So I have my ballot is on its way to California and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=166.88s)]
*  And I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  So, but I did vote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=185.56s)]
*  What? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=187.52s)]
*  She won't talk about what she thinks about that proposition. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=190.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=193.72s)]
*  Oh, I'm not going to. I think she probably didn't even know what it was about. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=195.04s)]
*  And this woman talks about Trump disqualifying himself from being president for some offhand remarks that the media and her team purposely misconstrue to mislead the public. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=198.12s)]
*  Now, how can you be president and not be candid or at all specific about any serious questions about crime or the economy? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=210.6s)]
*  If you're earning 500, 600, 700 thousand dollars under your plan, there's a good chance your taxes go up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=221.44s)]
*  We can't have this conversation without knowing what that it's very complicated situation, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=227.6s)]
*  It's very complicated, Anderson. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=232.2s)]
*  A simple question about whether taxes are going to go up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=234.28s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=236.24s)]
*  Now, in the end, this race is going to boil down to whether enough Michiganders want to save their auto industry, which will be totally destroyed if Kamala's EV madness isn't reversed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=237.04s)]
*  I mean, if you doubt that, I suggest reading the new Bloomberg Business Week cover story on China's plan to dominate the EV market. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=247.68s)]
*  It is terrifying. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  And in Pennsylvania, the race is up to whether we'll see enough voters think it's worth saving U.S. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=258.68s)]
*  steal from foreign ownership. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=264.52s)]
*  In Georgia, voters are going to have to decide if the flood of illegals into their towns and their cities is acceptable and whether the additional crime is what they want and whether they want to ensure the jobs go to Americans, Americans, not to migrants. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=268.08s)]
*  So as we come to the end of this campaign, one thing is clear. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=283.88s)]
*  The Republican Party, under the leadership of President Trump, is offering Americans a real choice for the future. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=287.92s)]
*  If you like the current economy under Biden and Harris, if you're itching to have Liz Cheney as secretary of defense and if you think it's OK risking World War Three, then you got to vote for Kamala. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=295.04s)]
*  But if you think we can do better, if you'd like to have more money in your pocket, if you want a president who puts Americans first, then you need to vote for Trump and the GOP. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=308.72s)]
*  So Trump's right when he's been saying that America has been in decline. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=320.12s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=322.92s)]
*  But it doesn't happen to continue this way. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  An empty pantsuit isn't the answer for an anxious America. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  We're just two nights away from the polls closing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  I know I can't believe it either. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=336.48s)]
*  In every election, you always hear every vote counts. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=338.52s)]
*  But this election, it really does. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=341.68s)]
*  The polls tell us it's the tightest race in a half a century and both candidates are treating it that way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=343.84s)]
*  Trump and Harris spent the weekend all over the battlegrounds, giving each other their best shot. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=349.52s)]
*  Polls are showing we're going to win everything. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=360.8s)]
*  We're going to win the popular vote. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=362.88s)]
*  And let me ask who here has already voted. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=366.0s)]
*  And let me ask, anybody here already voted? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=371.2s)]
*  And let me then ask, who here has already voted? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=376.72s)]
*  We must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=383.12s)]
*  Turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=387.12s)]
*  If Kamala wins, you are three days away from the start of a 1929 style economic depression. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=391.84s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=398.56s)]
*  Just Google Project 2025, which still I can't believe they put in writing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=399.2s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=404.64s)]
*  And I said, I don't know about it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=406.56s)]
*  Everything she says is a lie. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=409.52s)]
*  He wants to put them in jail. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=411.2s)]
*  I will give them a seat at the table. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=416.56s)]
*  A country of chaos, fear and hate. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=428.4s)]
*  Or a country of freedom, justice and compassion. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=431.12s)]
*  Kamala broke it and we will fix it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=433.92s)]
*  And we're going to fix it fast. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=436.64s)]
*  And when we fight, we win. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=438.48s)]
*  You're the worst vice president in history. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=441.44s)]
*  Kamala, you're fired. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=444.56s)]
*  Get the hell out of here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=446.32s)]
*  Both campaigns are also talking a lot of trash. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=449.44s)]
*  Former Obama guy, David Plouffe, has been running around in D.C. telling everybody [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=452.56s)]
*  undecideds are breaking for Harris. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=457.68s)]
*  Trump's campaign manager not having it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=460.32s)]
*  David can't do anything but BS until Tuesday because we're kicking his ass. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=463.36s)]
*  The only thing the Harris campaign is functional at this point is the BS machine [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=469.04s)]
*  that is dutifully repeated by the legacy media as if fact. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=473.44s)]
*  Team Harris is now claiming they're no longer underdogs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=478.24s)]
*  Trump's team scoffing at that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=481.76s)]
*  They say they're the ones expanding the map. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=484.48s)]
*  I'm not supposed to say this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=488.4s)]
*  You know, I'm going to be like the fake news. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=490.0s)]
*  They're saying it's very close. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=492.4s)]
*  It's really not very close. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=493.84s)]
*  Based on based on what's been happening. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=497.52s)]
*  It's not so close. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=501.84s)]
*  We're leading. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  We're leading in all seven swing states and we're certainly doing well in Virginia. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=504.56s)]
*  It's not considered a swing state, but it may very well be a swing state. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=513.36s)]
*  And I just had a little thing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=517.92s)]
*  A little birdie told me that we're we're leading in New Jersey. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=519.6s)]
*  What's that all about? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  So one election night, keep your eye on New Jersey. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=525.36s)]
*  If it's close there, Trump's going to have a big night. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=527.92s)]
*  Also Tuesday, look at New Hampshire. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=530.96s)]
*  That state's not supposed to be a battleground, but apparently it is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=533.36s)]
*  Clinton and Biden just went there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=536.88s)]
*  Trump just sent JD there today. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=539.2s)]
*  And Trump himself tore up the schedule and made a last minute stop in Virginia. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=541.6s)]
*  So watch these three states early Tuesday evening and that should tell you a lot. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  The betting markets have had Trump ahead pretty consistently, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  but big money's been coming in on Harris late. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=553.6s)]
*  And Democrat numbers guru Nate Silver is now giving Trump the slightest edge or [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  Kamala the slightest edge. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  Who knows, but this election is going to be decided in the battlegrounds. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=565.04s)]
*  And the polls have been interesting. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=569.12s)]
*  Trump was leading every swing state last week, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=571.92s)]
*  but Harris just took the tiniest lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=575.04s)]
*  but she's still down in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=578.88s)]
*  But behind the scenes, are they confident? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=581.52s)]
*  What I'm here to tell you tonight based on my reporting with Democrats and Republicans [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=585.2s)]
*  nationally and in both those states, that it could be that Kamala Harris wins Pennsylvania, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=589.12s)]
*  but loses the White House because she loses Wisconsin. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=594.16s)]
*  My reporting is that she's in trouble in Wisconsin. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=597.36s)]
*  This is based on three sources, two Republicans, one Democrat, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=600.24s)]
*  all of whom know the state quite well. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=603.76s)]
*  And all of whom told me today the same version of they would be somewhere between [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=605.52s)]
*  surprised and shocked if Kamala Harris won Wisconsin. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=610.16s)]
*  And on the ground in Pennsylvania, Democrats don't know what's going to happen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=614.4s)]
*  I've been saying this, whether it was Biden or then became [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=620.64s)]
*  Harris, I said it's going to be very close. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=624.48s)]
*  And Trump definitely has a connection with voters here in Pennsylvania. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=626.96s)]
*  And that's why it's going to be close. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=631.52s)]
*  Well, the Harris team's hoping Trump voters don't turn out, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=634.96s)]
*  but early numbers say they are. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=638.16s)]
*  I think it's a bigger gaffe than people think. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=639.76s)]
*  It's so funny, Joe Biden, his whole career, he was like, Mr. Gaff. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=645.52s)]
*  And then here at the very end, he's like Aaron Judge in Game Six, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=649.6s)]
*  just, just he f***ing lost the fly ball and at the end of the thing and blew the whole thing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=653.52s)]
*  Because I feel like it epitomizes everything that the Trump people hate about the Democrats. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=661.92s)]
*  They look down on us. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=668.48s)]
*  It's like, it's like deplorables times 10. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=669.84s)]
*  Republicans have been beating the drum that Trump has to win too big to rig. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=673.84s)]
*  45 has been spending a lot of time in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=679.2s)]
*  because if he wins those three East Coast states with healthy margins, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=683.84s)]
*  we'll know who the president is on election night. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=688.24s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=691.2s)]
*  Harris is city hopping. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=692.4s)]
*  She's hoping for huge turnout in Atlanta, Philly, Charlotte and Detroit. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=694.32s)]
*  She needs big black turnout to carry the battlegrounds. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=698.88s)]
*  Today she stopped by a barber shop in Michigan, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=702.4s)]
*  because as we know, she's got a man problem. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=705.28s)]
*  The gender gap again, we've talked about this throughout the campaign. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=710.64s)]
*  We've talked about this for decades. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=713.76s)]
*  Trump up 18 with men, Harris 16 with women. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  That is a 34 point gender gap by about 10 points. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=718.72s)]
*  If this happens, this would be the biggest gender gap ever recorded. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=723.12s)]
*  Stunning in his lead with men, bigger than her lead with women. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=727.52s)]
*  So it's shaping up to be a battle of the sexes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=731.52s)]
*  Will women shock us like they did in the midterms? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=734.56s)]
*  Well, no, pretty soon. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=737.52s)]
*  Women can be unpredictable. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  These two are battling down to the wire. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=741.6s)]
*  Both campaigns have spent about a billion dollars in ads. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=743.6s)]
*  Democrats with the edge in spending. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=747.36s)]
*  I know you're fed up with the ads, but look on the bright side. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=750.16s)]
*  In two days, no more ads. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=752.56s)]
*  Kamala has out raised them, but Trump has out campaigned her. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=754.72s)]
*  I can't even believe people are undecided at this point, but [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=758.16s)]
*  every time either of these two candidates open their mouths, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=761.6s)]
*  they can win or lose votes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=764.88s)]
*  Kamala just voted early in California today. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=767.04s)]
*  You know how in California you can steal under a thousand dollars [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=770.16s)]
*  and it's only a misdemeanor? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=773.36s)]
*  They have a proposition to get rid of that, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=775.04s)]
*  because shoplifting is out of control. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=776.88s)]
*  How did you vote on Prop 36? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=778.8s)]
*  So I have my ballot is on its way to California [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=785.12s)]
*  And I am not going to talk about the vote on that, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=789.12s)]
*  because honestly, it's the Sunday before the election [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  around it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  So, but I did vote. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=799.92s)]
*  Kamala not taking a position on a big issue [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=802.64s)]
*  because it might affect the election. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  She couldn't be more of a politician if she tried. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=806.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden saying whatever the hell he wants, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=809.36s)]
*  doesn't give a flip. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=812.08s)]
*  The Harris campaign is still reeling from garbage gate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  The last thing the Harris campaign needs is Biden popping off, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=817.28s)]
*  but he did it again this weekend. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=820.64s)]
*  I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guy. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=823.52s)]
*  I'll tell you what, man. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=826.24s)]
*  When I was in Scranton, I used to have a little trouble [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=828.32s)]
*  going down the plot line. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  I used to have a little trouble going down the plot line. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=832.32s)]
*  I used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=834.64s)]
*  But I'm serious. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  These are the kind of guys you like to smack in the ass. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=841.28s)]
*  So in the last two weeks, Biden said he wants to lock up Trump [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=845.2s)]
*  and smack his garbage supporters in the ass. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=848.64s)]
*  Oh, and he also sucked on four babies toes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=851.12s)]
*  At this point, both campaigns not really playing it safe, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=854.4s)]
*  Trump because he doesn't know how to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=858.0s)]
*  and Kamala because she can't control Joe. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=860.32s)]
*  So whatever happens for the next 48 hours, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=862.88s)]
*  expect the media and the pollsters to flood the zone [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=865.28s)]
*  with good news for Kamala and depressing news for Trump. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  They'll try to prop up Democrats and demoralize Republicans. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=872.0s)]
*  They did this in 16 and 20. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=875.68s)]
*  Both races, though, decided by just 30 to 40,000 votes [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=877.68s)]
*  across three to four swing states. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're telling us this time the race is even tighter. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=884.8s)]
*  So tune out the noise. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=888.24s)]
*  The fundamentals of the race haven't changed. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=889.84s)]
*  And on Tuesday, no one else can decide the election except you. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=892.64s)]
*  If you go out and vote. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=897.28s)]
*  All right, Donald Trump in Macon, Georgia tonight, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  his third rally of the day, I believe he has four tomorrow. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  In 48 hours, the polls will be closed [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=905.28s)]
*  and the results will start pouring in. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=907.92s)]
*  This could very easily be the closest election [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=910.16s)]
*  in American history. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=912.88s)]
*  Nate Silver put it this way. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=914.24s)]
*  He calls it a pure toss up with an advantage towards Donald Trump. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  What does this mean for all of you? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=919.12s)]
*  Please assume, as I have been telling you, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=921.2s)]
*  that your one vote will determine the outcome of this election. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=924.08s)]
*  For those of you who voted early, I want to say thank you [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=928.16s)]
*  because you know what? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=931.36s)]
*  You're doing your part. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=932.16s)]
*  But for the 80 to 90 million people, Americans, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=933.52s)]
*  that will be voting on Election Day, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=936.8s)]
*  please know the stakes could not be higher. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=939.36s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to get to the latest polls [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=941.44s)]
*  from key battleground states around the country. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=943.2s)]
*  We have a lot of polling today with some of the top pollsters [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  in the country. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=948.48s)]
*  We begin with an unfortunate truth about today's [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=949.6s)]
*  radical, extreme, democratic, socialist, Marxist party. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  For most Democrats, power is the only thing that matters. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=957.52s)]
*  That's it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=960.32s)]
*  Look at Kamala Harris. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=961.12s)]
*  She doesn't have a plan to improve your life for months. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  She didn't even have a single policy proposal on her website [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=965.2s)]
*  until her poll numbers started to take a dive. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=968.72s)]
*  She wouldn't talk to the press. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=970.96s)]
*  She wouldn't answer questions. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=972.48s)]
*  Axios is calling Kamala the, quote, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  no comment candidate because of her lack of transparency, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=976.32s)]
*  her shifting positions, her vague statements, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=980.1600000000001s)]
*  word salads on top of it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  She's not putting forward good ideas [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=985.6s)]
*  because she doesn't have any. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  When you look at her really deeply held principal views, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  she can't tell them to the American people [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=994.96s)]
*  because they're so out of the mainstream. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=997.2s)]
*  She's not touted her own record because it's terrible. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=999.44s)]
*  She can't run, are you better off than you were four years ago [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  because you're not. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1005.68s)]
*  Instead, she's trying to scare people, trick people, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  and use fear and fear-mongering into voting for her. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1010.3199999999999s)]
*  Almost everything she is now saying is an outright lie. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1015.3599999999999s)]
*  For example, you have probably heard Kamala praising Gen Z [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1019.04s)]
*  over and over and over again on the campaign trail. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1022.88s)]
*  Yeah, but here's what she actually said about that 18 [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1025.76s)]
*  to 24-year-old demographic [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1028.48s)]
*  before she desperately needed their votes. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1030.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  What's the other thing we know about this population, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1033.92s)]
*  and it's a specific phase of life. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1036.32s)]
*  Remember, age is more than a chronological fact. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1037.92s)]
*  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1040.8s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1044.32s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1048.4s)]
*  and they have a resident assistant. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1052.08s)]
*  They make really bad decisions. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1055.44s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1059.04s)]
*  Now, the only thing that would make them stupid [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1060.8s)]
*  if they voted for somebody that called them stupid. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1062.56s)]
*  Now, Kamala's not just lying about young people. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1065.04s)]
*  She does this with every demographic. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1067.52s)]
*  In order to scare the elderly, she is lying to them and saying, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1070.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to upend Medicare and limit Social Security. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1074.24s)]
*  It's an outright lie. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  Benefits under Donald Trump, his first term, increased, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1079.52s)]
*  and he has pledged to never, ever touch Social Security or Medicare. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1083.04s)]
*  It is beyond repulsive that Kamala Harris [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1087.9199999999998s)]
*  will scare old people and lie to old people like this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1090.8s)]
*  And in order to scare women, Kamala is out there claiming [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump wants a national abortion ban. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  He has said over and over and over again he does not, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1100.48s)]
*  that he wants to limit contraception. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1104.0s)]
*  He has never said any such thing. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1106.24s)]
*  And outlaw IVF when he said just the opposite. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1108.48s)]
*  These are all egregious lies. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  The exact opposite is true. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  I hope women won't believe her lies. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1115.84s)]
*  And look at this headline. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  The Harris campaign is now using two entirely different messages [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1120.0s)]
*  on Israel and Gaza, depending on whether you live in Michigan or Pennsylvania. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1124.56s)]
*  If you live in Michigan, well, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1130.16s)]
*  Harris is pandering to the Arab communities [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1132.24s)]
*  with lofty words about the suffering in Gaza. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1135.28s)]
*  But if you live in Pennsylvania, the ad is all about protecting Israel's right to exist. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1138.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, fear mongering surrounding minority voters across the country [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1143.04s)]
*  is through the roof. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1147.4399999999998s)]
*  But in reality, under Trump's first term, pay close attention. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1148.8s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  African American youth unemployment were thriving like never before. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1158.24s)]
*  Let's take a look at the numbers from a 2020 Fox Business article. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  Quote, while the overall growth rate was 6.8 percent. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1167.12s)]
*  Now, compare that to the 12,000 jobs just created that we found out about in the last month. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1171.4399999999998s)]
*  12,000? That is anemic, to say the least. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1177.2s)]
*  Anyway, 6.8 percent real median income grew by an even greater number. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1181.04s)]
*  7.9 percent for African Americans, 7.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1186.24s)]
*  10.6 percent for Asian Americans, all record highs and record income levels. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1192.32s)]
*  We had record low unemployment for every one of those demographic groups, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1199.2s)]
*  record after record after record. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1203.28s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1205.04s)]
*  In 2019, the poverty rate plummeted 1.3 percentage points to a 60-year low. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1206.24s)]
*  Over 4.1 million people lifted out of poverty. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1212.8s)]
*  The child poverty rate also decreased to a sixth decade low. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1216.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris says she wants to cut taxes on the middle class. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1220.96s)]
*  Nope. Again, she is lying. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1224.88s)]
*  If she is elected, she has promised to let the Trump tax cuts that created that economic growth [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1226.88s)]
*  and prosperity for all demographics expire, a massive tax increase for every American. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1233.12s)]
*  And you will be guaranteed to keep paying more money for energy, for gas, for groceries [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1239.6s)]
*  on top of the taxes on unrealized capital gains. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  And no, Donald Trump demanding free and fair trade with other countries will lower prices. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1248.0s)]
*  It will not increase them. It is not a tax. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1253.28s)]
*  So in Kamala's first year in office, all of your taxes will go up and you will, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  your take home pay will be far less. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1261.36s)]
*  But if you really want to know what your life is going to be like under a Harris administration, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1264.24s)]
*  you don't need a vivid imagination. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1269.76s)]
*  Ask yourself basic questions because there's going to be 80 to 90 million people voting on Tuesday. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  Are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1279.52s)]
*  Is your border, our borders, are they more secure or are they less secure? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1283.28s)]
*  Is the world more peaceful or more chaotic or in Europe or in the middle East? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1288.56s)]
*  Do you have more money or less money in your pocket? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1293.84s)]
*  Do your groceries, are they more expensive or are they less expensive? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1297.68s)]
*  Are you paying more to heat and to cool your home? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1302.48s)]
*  When you fill up your car, your truck, is gas more expensive or less expensive? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1305.68s)]
*  About a buck 50 more a gallon. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1311.28s)]
*  Have your insurance rates gone up? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  Are interest rates much higher, almost doubling the cost of the average person's mortgage? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1315.04s)]
*  What about violent crime? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1321.52s)]
*  How's that defund, dismantle, no bail, re-imagine the police thing working out? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1322.8s)]
*  Do you feel more safe, more secure in your town, in your city? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1327.36s)]
*  According to newly revised FBI numbers, violent crime is up a whopping 4.5%. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1332.1599999999999s)]
*  These revised numbers detailed an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1337.68s)]
*  33,459 robberies, 37,091 aggravated assaults. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1345.44s)]
*  And according to recently released federal numbers, more than 15,000 illegal immigrants [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1352.32s)]
*  now living inside our country have been convicted or accused of murder. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1358.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of suspected terrorists who crossed into Harris-Biden borders, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  unvetted, they're still living in the United States. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1369.84s)]
*  We have terrorists here. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1374.08s)]
*  We just don't know where they are. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1375.1999999999998s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, this has been the biggest failure on every level. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1377.12s)]
*  They can't run on a single program that they have implemented that is major life better. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  So lies, smears, slander, besmirchment is the only thing the Harris campaigns got left. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1389.52s)]
*  Remember, all Trump supporters, all of us, we are Nazis, fascists, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1394.96s)]
*  racists and garbage on top of all of that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1399.6s)]
*  We're just trash. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1402.32s)]
*  And right on cue, New York's Democratic governor, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1403.68s)]
*  Kathy Hochul, who said conservatives like me need to get on a bus and go to Florida. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1406.64s)]
*  And I took her advice. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1411.52s)]
*  I went on a bus and I moved to the Florida Bureau of Fox [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1412.8s)]
*  because she's saying Trump supporters, yeah, you're un-American. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1416.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1421.04s)]
*  If you're voting for these Republicans in New York, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1422.5600000000002s)]
*  you are voting for someone who supports Donald Trump, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  and you're anti-woman, you're anti-abortion, and basically you're anti-American. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1428.64s)]
*  Because you have just trashed American values and what our country is all about [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1433.68s)]
*  over and over and over. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1438.16s)]
*  And you'll wear this on Election Day. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1439.44s)]
*  That's like the governor before her, Andrew Cuomo, you know, talking about, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1442.96s)]
*  they're not New Yorkers. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1446.88s)]
*  If they're pro-life and pro-Second Amendment, they're not New Yorkers. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1449.04s)]
*  And there's no place in New York. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1453.92s)]
*  He actually said it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, another Harris surrogate said that he wanted to slap Republicans on the ass. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1463.04s)]
*  They want another giant tax cut for the wealthy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1465.36s)]

*  But I'm serious. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBxXlLloEg&t=1480.1599999999999s)]
