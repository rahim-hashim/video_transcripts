# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 17, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw)
*  Look, this is going to be a tough weekend for Democrats, so we should have some compassion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=0.0s)]
*  as human beings. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=6.28s)]
*  After all, they were so magnanimous around the same time four years ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=8.24s)]
*  Oh wait, they weren't. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=11.84s)]
*  The president of the United States incited an armed insurrection. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  He is responsible for this insurrection. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=20.68s)]
*  He is responsible for this treason. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=23.36s)]
*  President Trump could face criminal charges. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=25.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is leaving the office disgraced. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=27.44s)]
*  Ah, very magnanimous. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  And their media pals too. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=33.24s)]
*  In fact, they were using January 6th to set their narrative for Biden's entire presidency. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=34.44s)]
*  Sweeping moves. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  Using the DOJ, of course, to destroy any chance they thought that Trump ever had to return [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  to politics again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=46.36s)]
*  They had control of much of the media narrative as well, and had most of the money class on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  their side. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg, he ponied up $20 million to help boost Biden during the campaign. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  David Geffen, the longtime Democrat mega donor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=57.96s)]
*  Of course, the darkest of dark forces, George Soros. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Biden even gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Accepted by his son Alex Soros, of course. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=67.46s)]
*  Now, for most of Biden's presidency, the mega rich flocked to support him at glitzy fundraisers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=70.0s)]
*  attended by the movers and shakers of the industry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=76.36s)]
*  They all came to pay homage. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=80.14s)]
*  What was wild was how much money Biden and Harris were able to raise, no matter how bad [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=83.24s)]
*  they were as candidates. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=88.64s)]
*  They still got the big money hauls. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  Kamala raised a billion, including a lot from heavy hitters, only to lose. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=93.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=97.6s)]
*  In fact, more billionaires supported Kamala Harris than Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=98.6s)]
*  83 to 52. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=102.96s)]
*  But that was then, and this is now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=106.32s)]
*  Over the past two months, the elites from tech and Wall Street are crawling over glass [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=108.76s)]
*  to work with Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=113.78s)]
*  Zuckerberg, Bezos, even Bill Gates all showed up at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=115.4s)]
*  Bill Gates, a story today broke that said he was impressed after his three hour dinner [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=119.84s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  And now, suddenly, Russia collusion has been replaced with oligarch collusion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=127.22s)]
*  If the decision is made that the multi-billionaires, the super, super wealthy, the wealthiest people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=134.88s)]
*  in the world, begin to control the apparatuses from the media to the economy, then who do [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=144.76s)]
*  I get to fight back for me? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=155.32s)]
*  And dutifully, the press vomits the same nonsense. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=159.12s)]
*  Biden's speechwriter for his goodbye address gave Democrats their new talking point, which [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=162.52s)]
*  then they quickly echoed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=167.36s)]
*  Let's talk about Joe Biden's continued concern about the rise of oligarchs. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  You have billionaires that are going to be pushing to deregulate industries to make their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=175.72s)]
*  multinational corporations richer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=182.88s)]
*  That farewell addresses a milestone culturally in this country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=185.3s)]
*  What are wealth that can buy political power, that can control what people are seeing on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=188.36s)]
*  their algorithms? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, the Biden donors weren't trying to buy political power then. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Is that what we're supposed to believe? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=201.24s)]
*  This is ludicrous. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  The truth is, Democrats are flailing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=203.8s)]
*  These industry captains from Silicon Valley to Wall Street are going where the power is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  now and the power right now is with Trump and the Republicans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  Democrats are fine with monopolies of power when they are the political beneficiaries. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=214.92s)]
*  So what liberals are really mad about is that they can no longer control the narrative anymore. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=220.22s)]
*  Everyone is a news gatherer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  Everyone has a voice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=228.44s)]
*  And the old media poodles have gotten their comeuppance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  And speaking of poodles. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=234.2s)]
*  During his farewell address, he warned the free press is crumbling in this country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  I would add that's only if we the people let that happen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=241.68s)]
*  Journalists exist to seek the truth, to tell people's stories, to lift up voices that may [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  not be heard otherwise, to shine a light on injustice and to hold the powerful accountable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=250.16s)]
*  We are not the enemy of the people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=256.04s)]
*  We are the defenders of the people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=257.8s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=259.88s)]
*  You really should hit the comedy line circuit with that routine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=261.76s)]
*  Now look in the end. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=266.36s)]
*  The test of Trump's success is whether he'll be able to work with all of these different [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=267.36s)]
*  groups and individuals that are coming to meet with him that he's assembling to make [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=271.6s)]
*  life better for the average American. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=275.56s)]
*  America first is why he won. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=278.64s)]
*  And his serving that agenda will make him even more popular through his four years in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=281.56s)]
*  office than he is right now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=286.72s)]
*  Get a good look. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=288.88s)]
*  It might be one of the last times you see him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=289.88s)]
*  Joe Biden left the White House today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=292.32s)]
*  He's playing Marine One for one final trip as president. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=295.56s)]
*  And before that, you got a question from the press. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=298.36s)]
*  Well, we'll see about that because inauguration is looking a little different. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=314.36s)]
*  More on that later. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=318.04s)]
*  Biden's leaving office, quote, totally dejected. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=319.72s)]
*  People say the White House feels like a morgue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=323.16s)]
*  All of Biden's friends are giving him a eulogy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, I really miss Biden. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  I feel like we were safe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=331.36s)]
*  I didn't have to worry. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Was everything going to blow up? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=333.88000000000005s)]
*  I could live my life while he was there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  Now every day I wake up and I worry, what is this guy going to do next? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a bitter goodbye. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=340.88s)]
*  And Joe's going out screaming. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=342.48s)]
*  This one of the last events that I'll be doing as president. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=345.48s)]
*  I affirm the Equal Rights Amendment to have cleared all the necessary hurdles to be added [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=348.72s)]
*  to the U.S. Constitution now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=360.72s)]
*  It's the 28th Amendment to the Constitution now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Every lawyer in D.C. is trying to figure out what he just said. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=373.6s)]
*  Brett bears bow ties in a tangled mess. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=376.68s)]
*  Did the president just announce he added things to the Constitution? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  How? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=383.96s)]
*  It sounds like Biden thinks he just added an amendment. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=385.36s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=388.76s)]
*  There is no 28th Amendment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=389.8s)]
*  If Trump announced he'd made an amendment to the Constitution, all hell would break loose. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=392.0s)]
*  But the media has not even taken Joe seriously. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=395.4s)]
*  They're like, eh, he says things. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=397.92s)]
*  Two people close to Biden tell NBC that, quote, privately, Biden has vacillated from feeling [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=401.36s)]
*  melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=406.12s)]
*  Have you ever seen a man go through so many mood swings? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=412.24s)]
*  Is he having menopause? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=417.04s)]
*  And he's also full of regret. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=419.12s)]
*  The mistake we made was. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=422.76s)]
*  I think I made. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=425.36s)]
*  Was not getting our allies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=428.4s)]
*  To acknowledge that the Democrats did this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=432.76000000000005s)]
*  So, for example, no new billion dollar bridge over the river. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=437.04s)]
*  Well, call it the Democratic Bridge, figuratively speaking. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  Talk about who put it together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=446.24s)]
*  Let people know that this was something the Democrats did. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=449.24s)]
*  That was done by the party. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  That's different than me writing a check and me signing a check and saying I did it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=455.04s)]
*  I'm not a very good huckster. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=460.48s)]
*  This is the guy Democrats said should be on Mount Rushmore. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=462.92s)]
*  You think Teddy Roosevelt in his exit interview whined about not getting enough credit? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=466.16s)]
*  I should have put my name on bridges and stemmy checks. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=471.04s)]
*  This isn't a great statesman. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=474.88s)]
*  No one feels sorry for a guy with his own jet nukes and chef. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=476.48s)]
*  Biden had the entire media and tech industry on his side, and he thinks he had a PR problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=481.04s)]
*  The media is remembering the Biden era a little differently. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  They're remembering a president who lied to them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=490.0s)]
*  Democrats, including you, were relentlessly harsh against special counsel Robert Herr [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=493.28s)]
*  for making an observation that proved pretty accurate about how Joe Biden might appear to a jury [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=499.88s)]
*  as a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=505.0s)]
*  And a president who hid from them. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=508.08s)]
*  They started to get smarter from the perspective of keeping him from saying something off script. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=511.4s)]
*  They would put a microphone two feet inside of a door for him in some room on campus. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=518.52s)]
*  A door would open and he would go right to the microphone. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  Then when he was done, he would step right out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  No chance to shout anything. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  Or they would pack the room with people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=531.24s)]
*  Just hundreds of people would suddenly show up, materialize between us and him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=535.0s)]
*  Or they found eventually the cord to plug somebody's iPhone in and they would just blast music [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  so that people could not get anything to him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=545.32s)]
*  And so a lot of it was stagecraft. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  The raging Cajun calls the Biden legacy, quote, one of the great tragedies of American politics. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=550.84s)]
*  He should be having a glorious, well-deserved, highly acclaimed retirement. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  And he's not. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=560.36s)]
*  It's hard to blame anybody but him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=562.2s)]
*  The Atlantic says Biden destroyed his legacy by stubbornly setting off on his own reelection [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=564.6s)]
*  by strapping his party to a shuffling frame. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=570.5999999999999s)]
*  He doomed the nation to realizing the nightmare scenario that he'd promised to prevent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=573.48s)]
*  He created the ideal conditions for Trump's return and for his own spectacular failure. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=578.76s)]
*  And not only is he leaving with zero cash for a presidential library, he's living with no friends. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=585.24s)]
*  Biden's people say the relationship between him and Nancy is, quote, permanently damaged. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=591.24s)]
*  His relationship with Kamala is being called frosty. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  After Joe's been bragging about how he could have beaten Trump. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  But Kamala might have something up her sleeve. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=603.16s)]
*  I am fully aware that I am the public face of a lot of our work. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=606.68s)]
*  And so I have the benefit of running into people all over our country who thank me. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=612.04s)]
*  It is not my nature to go quietly into the night. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=617.56s)]
*  Publishers want to pay her millions to write a tell-all. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=622.4399999999999s)]
*  So this isn't over at all. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=625.24s)]
*  And Joe can't stop talking about Barack. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=627.72s)]
*  You've heard Barack get mad at me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=631.96s)]
*  Well, I was a kid all the time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=633.56s)]
*  So I know, I know all politics is personal. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=634.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=637.56s)]
*  Well, it's about understanding what motivates the other guy, other woman, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=638.6s)]
*  and what their interests are. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=647.0s)]
*  And it's all personal. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=648.84s)]
*  Biden's upset that Barry stabbed him in the back and Obama's upset [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=650.44s)]
*  that Joe didn't name an aircraft carrier after him. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=654.44s)]
*  After Biden named aircraft carriers, after Bush and Clinton this week, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=657.72s)]
*  Barack's people are complaining. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=661.16s)]
*  One said Barack H. Obama did not get an effing personnel carrier named after him. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=663.16s)]
*  The SS Hussein Obama doesn't really strike fear in the heart of our enemies. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=669.16s)]
*  So maybe that's a good oversight. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=672.04s)]
*  And Barack and Nancy aren't the only ones on Joe's bad side. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=674.6s)]
*  Chuck Schumer now in the hot seat too. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=678.68s)]
*  We just found out Chuck was the lead actor in the coup. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=681.64s)]
*  Although that's according to Chuck. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=685.4799999999999s)]
*  He just spilled his guts to the times. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=687.64s)]
*  According to the story, after the debate Schumer's flip phone wouldn't stop bringing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=689.8s)]
*  Biden wasn't leaving. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=695.56s)]
*  Instead, he released a letter telling Democrats to fall in line. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, Democrats didn't even think Joe wrote it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=700.52s)]
*  They thought it was written by Hunter. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  One senator said they wouldn't support Biden unless he could produce two neurologists [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=705.4799999999999s)]
*  to issue a public report saying he was fit to serve. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  And then hold a news conference where anyone could ask questions. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=712.92s)]
*  Obviously that never happened. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=716.8399999999999s)]
*  And inside of private meetings, they were all fighting with each other. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  John Federman was pleading with Schumer saying, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=722.12s)]
*  we've got to be for Joe Biden and accusing Democrats of having no spine. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=725.0s)]
*  Schumer scolded Federman saying, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=730.92s)]
*  you can always express what you think in our caucus, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=733.24s)]
*  but don't ever tell our members they have no spine. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=735.4s)]
*  It's not effective for you and not fair to them. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=738.12s)]
*  Remember Schumer leaked this to the Times, so it's just his side of the story. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=741.56s)]
*  Barack was getting worried that Democrats were doing nothing, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=745.88s)]
*  but he wasn't going to be the one to break the news to Joe. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=749.0s)]
*  Barry said his relationship with Joe was fragile. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=752.04s)]
*  And he told Chuck, you may be the better one. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=755.88s)]
*  He was like, trust me, you don't want me to do this. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=759.56s)]
*  And when Chuck showed up in Rehoboth Beach, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  he heard Biden shouting on a Zoom call with other Democrats, I'm not leaving. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=764.8399999999999s)]
*  And he knew things were about to get awkward. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=770.12s)]
*  So Chuck had to tell him how bad his poll numbers were. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=771.96s)]
*  And he showed him a sheet where Biden had just a 5% chance of beating Trump. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=774.76s)]
*  And Biden looked at it like he'd never seen numbers like this before. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=780.12s)]
*  His own pollsters were hiding the numbers from him. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=783.96s)]
*  He sat down near a screened-in porch overlooking a pond in Delaware and said, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=787.24s)]
*  if you run and you lose to Trump and we lose the Senate and we don't get back the House, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=791.8s)]
*  that 50 years of amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=797.32s)]
*  But worse, you can go down in American history as one of the darkest figures. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=801.0s)]
*  And left with one last warning, quote, if I were you, I wouldn't run. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=806.2s)]
*  And I'm urging you not to run. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  Biden didn't shout, didn't argue. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=814.12s)]
*  All he did was say, you really think Kamala can win? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=815.72s)]
*  And then Biden said, I need a week. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=820.28s)]
*  As Schumer walked out, Biden put his hands on the shoulder and says, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=823.0s)]
*  quote, you've got bigger balls than anyone I've ever met. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=826.44s)]
*  And Chuck went out to his car and broke down crying, crying Chuck. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=831.72s)]
*  A week later, Biden dropped out. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=837.0s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=840.44s)]
*  And tonight in less than three days, Donald Trump will be sworn into office [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=841.4000000000001s)]
*  as the 47th president of our country. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=846.76s)]
*  On Sunday, we will be at our nation's Capitol with a live show. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=849.88s)]
*  We're going to kick off what will be a very busy historic week on Monday [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  because of dangerously cold temperatures. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=858.36s)]
*  I mean, with the wind chill below zero, it's going to be really cold. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=861.24s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump's inauguration will take place inside, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=865.88s)]
*  making him the first president since Ronald Reagan to be sworn in at the Capitol Rotunda. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  I think a good call. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=874.36s)]
*  Reagan's 1985 inauguration was also held inside because of extremely cold weather. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=875.56s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump is expected to hit the ground running with a flurry of executive orders, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=882.6s)]
*  other critical measures, but not before a little celebration. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=888.04s)]
*  There will be musical performances. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=892.68s)]
*  Carrie Underwood, America the Beautiful, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean, Kid Rock, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=894.84s)]
*  Billy Ray Cyrus, the Village People, Lee Greenwood. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=901.24s)]
*  They're all going to be there. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=904.76s)]
*  And speaking of Billy Ray, he will also be performing at the Make America Great Again rally. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=906.12s)]
*  That's on Sunday night. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=910.84s)]
*  He will be with us in just a few minutes. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=912.28s)]
*  We'll get a preview of that and why he felt so strongly about going to Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=914.12s)]
*  after the assassination attempt. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=919.8s)]
*  Now, there will also be dozens of business leaders in town. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=921.88s)]
*  Well, Elon Musk will be there. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=925.8s)]
*  Bezos will be there. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=927.56s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg will be there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=928.76s)]
*  Apple CEO Tim Cook will be there. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=930.28s)]
*  Even Bill Gates seems excited about Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=932.8399999999999s)]
*  He was, quote, impressed and intrigued after a recent dinner with the president-elect. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=938.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=942.36s)]
*  Have you met with Donald Trump since the election? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I had a chance to go have a long and actually quite intriguing dinner with him. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=946.6800000000001s)]
*  What did you discuss? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=952.44s)]
*  What was intriguing? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=953.24s)]
*  Well, we touched on a lot of things. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=954.6s)]
*  It was over three hours. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=956.2s)]
*  To my surprise, it was just he and I, his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=958.0400000000001s)]
*  and the person who helps manage things for me, Larry Cohen. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=962.84s)]
*  So the four of us sat there and it was quite wide-ranging. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=966.12s)]
*  I felt like he was energized and looking forward to helping to drive innovation. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=970.28s)]
*  I was frankly impressed with how well he showed a lot of interest in the issues I brought up. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=980.28s)]
*  He's describing the guy that I've known for 30 years. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=988.28s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump isn't just bringing together business leaders. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=991.16s)]
*  For the first time, the prime minister of Italy, the president of Argentina, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=994.76s)]
*  they will be attending the inauguration. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=998.8399999999999s)]
*  China, meanwhile, they're sending their vice president [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1001.0799999999999s)]
*  after a recent phone call between Donald Trump and President Xi. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1004.12s)]
*  And last but certainly not least, all of this was made possible by all of you, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1008.04s)]
*  each and every one of you. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1015.0s)]
*  And again, I can't thank each and every one of you enough. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1016.1999999999999s)]
*  This can be the most transformational presidency in 100 years. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1019.7199999999999s)]
*  There will be thousands upon thousands of loyal Donald Trump supporters like you in DC, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1024.28s)]
*  celebrating what is a new day in America that would have been, you know, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1030.28s)]
*  would not have been possible without all of your hard work, your effort, your perseverance. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1035.16s)]
*  And many of you watching tonight, you have stuck with Donald Trump through thick and thin, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1040.84s)]
*  through trials, through witch hunts, through early morning raids, dishonest smear campaigns, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1045.8s)]
*  two assassination attempts. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1051.48s)]
*  Many of you were shunned, you were censored, you were harassed [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1053.4s)]
*  simply because of your deeply held political beliefs. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1056.84s)]
*  But you hung in there, you did the right thing, you fought hard for what you believed in. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  And because of all of you, Donald Trump now has a mandate to return America [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1065.0s)]
*  to what I'm calling constitutional order. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1070.68s)]
*  Imagine cutting $2 trillion in spending, and that would limit the size, the scope, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1073.32s)]
*  the influence of government. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1078.68s)]
*  That would be less bureaucracy, that would be greater freedom. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1080.3600000000001s)]
*  What a concept, limited government. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1084.2s)]
*  And for the first time, a majority of the American people, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1086.28s)]
*  they are rooting for Donald Trump to succeed. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1088.92s)]
*  Nearly six out of 10 Americans believe that he will do a good job as president. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1091.64s)]
*  And meanwhile, the left is now more unpopular around the world than at any point [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1096.28s)]
*  since the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1101.72s)]
*  Freedom, meritocracy, individualism, logic, common sense, they are on the rise. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1104.52s)]
*  Statism, redistribution, socialism, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1111.24s)]
*  It is dying a needed death. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1116.92s)]
*  And here at home, the Democratic Party is in complete shambles, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1119.48s)]
*  a source close to President Biden telling NBC News [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1123.08s)]
*  that Biden feels, quote, totally dejected and the people around him as well. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1127.24s)]
*  And insiders are saying that the Biden White House feels like a morgue. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1132.76s)]
*  We have kind of been saying that in our own way for the past four years. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1138.28s)]
*  A majority of the American people say that Biden, he's made the economy worse. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1142.2s)]
*  They are right, he has. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1146.52s)]
*  He's leaving office with a record low approval rating. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1147.72s)]
*  Last night on MSDNC, Joe Biden does what he always does, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1151.0s)]
*  takes responsibility for nothing, lashes out against red states, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1155.72s)]
*  blaming conservatives for his poor job performance. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1161.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1164.8400000000001s)]
*  I got a lot of criticism, understandably. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  We've invested more in red states than blue states. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1169.64s)]
*  That's in this book, that's in this report. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1174.2s)]
*  For two reasons. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1176.52s)]
*  One, red states really screwed up in terms of the way they handle their economy [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1177.96s)]
*  and the way they handle manufacturing, the way they handle access to supply chains. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1182.8400000000001s)]
*  All right, that makes no sense at all whatsoever. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1188.76s)]
*  But that's what we have come to expect from the leader of the Democratic Party. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1192.76s)]
*  In fact, you probably won't see many highlights from Biden's final sit down interview [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1196.68s)]
*  on any other network because as per usual, it was nothing but a dumpster fire. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1201.3999999999999s)]
*  You decide. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1207.56s)]
*  You've heard Barack get mad at me when I was a kid all the time. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1209.96s)]
*  So he said, I know, I know, all politics is personal. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1212.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's about understanding what motivates the other guy, other woman, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1216.6s)]
*  and what their interests are. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1225.0s)]
*  That's different than me writing a check and me signing a check and saying, I did it. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1227.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not a very good huckster. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1232.76s)]
*  I didn't think, by the way, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1234.28s)]
*  I didn't think it was, I've got to go to Ukraine, but I think it was important. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1238.68s)]
*  It's clear, it's obvious, Americans on both sides of the aisle, Joe Biden is not fit to serve. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1243.24s)]
*  He's not been fit for four years to serve. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1248.92s)]
*  We told all of you this before the 2020 election. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1251.56s)]
*  At the time, we were kind of excoriated for telling the truth. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1255.8s)]
*  Over time, it became apparent to everybody. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1259.0s)]
*  According to the New York Times, multiple Democratic senators were begging Joe [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1261.96s)]
*  not to run for a second term. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1266.2s)]
*  That would include Chuck Schumer. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1268.12s)]
*  All the while Obama behind the scenes pulling the strings along with Nancy Pelosi. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1270.04s)]
*  And after all the election, all the big players, the Democratic party, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1275.96s)]
*  right now, they're kind of all hating on each other. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1281.1599999999999s)]
*  And historic loser Kamala Harris, apparently also not in good spirits. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1283.56s)]
*  According to insiders, she is deeply sad. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1288.68s)]
*  She feels betrayed by Joe Biden. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1291.56s)]
*  I think she's the one involved in betraying him and is also at war with almost every [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1294.6s)]
*  everyone in her own party. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1299.96s)]
*  Ultimately, after years of hysteria, dishonesty, woke politics, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1301.4s)]
*  eco-socialism, failure, the weaponization of government, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1305.88s)]
*  this is what the Democrats frankly have earned and this is what they deserve. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1310.04s)]
*  I hope they can use this moment to fix what's broken in their own party. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1314.28s)]
*  It would be nice to have a two-party system, but not a radical leftist system. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1318.92s)]
*  You know, one that would create a cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1324.6000000000001s)]
*  new Green Deal society with wide open borders without any vetting that offers free taxpayer [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1328.04s)]
*  funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants and convicts and also gender [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1334.44s)]
*  affirming care for children without parental consent. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1341.6399999999999s)]
*  That is not in touch with Americans values. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1344.84s)]
*  The only Democrat at this point that seems somewhat reasonable today is Senator John [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1347.32s)]
*  Fetterman of Pennsylvania. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1353.3999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be very interesting to watch him as the party moves forward. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1354.92s)]
*  But again, really, it's a time of reflection, introspection and a time on this show to say [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1359.24s)]
*  thanks to all of you because in less than three days, because of your hard work, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1366.04s)]
*  your dedication, you filtering out the lives of the legacy media, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1371.0800000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump will be back in office and America now has a golden opportunity to get back on track. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  Go to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1384.92s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymtxmcLOGw&t=1390.2s)]
