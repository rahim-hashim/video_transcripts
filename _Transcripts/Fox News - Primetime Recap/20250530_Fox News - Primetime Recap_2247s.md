# Fox News Highlights - May 29, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ)
*  San Fran's sick of it. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Now you gotta hand it to liberals. They really have some nerve. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=8.0s)]
*  They go about destroying public education with their woke agendas, sanctuary policies, watered down curricula, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=12.0s)]
*  and then think parents somehow won't notice when they attempt to hide it by eliminating objective standards. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Nice try. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=26.0s)]
*  Now you may not be aware, but schools across the country have already adopted versions of what's called equitable grading. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=27.0s)]
*  And just a few days ago, San Francisco was poised to embrace this concept fully until an outcry from parents erupted. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Now, to give you some familiarity with this, the plan would exclude classwork and homework from grading. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=43.0s)]
*  It would allow students to retake most tests and it would essentially give no penalty for lateness or showing little to no effort, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=50.0s)]
*  not participating in class, all that's out the window. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=59.0s)]
*  And they would base the entire grade off of something called summative assessments using a minimum of a 50% grade. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=62.0s)]
*  So it's not zero to 100 any longer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=70.0s)]
*  I know you're asking, what is this? And there must be an education consultant who's driving this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=73.0s)]
*  You bet. Meet Joe Feldman, the author of Grading for Equity. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=80.0s)]
*  I'm not saying we shouldn't use numbers to describe where students are, but there's a lot of problems with the zero to 100 scale. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=85.0s)]
*  And we can make that better using zero to four or one to four, for example. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Zero to four, one to four. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=99.0s)]
*  Well, that's silly. Why not just use smiley faces on tests instead than a frown face when you don't do so well? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=101.0s)]
*  Well, this ends up basically being a redistribution approach to grading because certain kids started, this theory goes, with more advantages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=108.0s)]
*  So we need to lower standards for the other students who didn't have those advantages and do it for equity's sake. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Now, listen closely. Note the jargon. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=125.0s)]
*  Then there's the bias resistance. So in many ways, traditional grading incorporates things outside of students' control into the grade. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=128.0s)]
*  These are sort of the institutional biases. So students whose families are of lower income, they're less likely to be able to do some of the things that are traditionally included in grading, like extra credit assignment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=139.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you go to the movie based on the book or you, you know, bring in cupcakes for the potluck we have at the end of the learning or, you know, things like that that require resources, you know, time, money, supervision. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=154.0s)]
*  How insulting is this? How many people do all of you know who came from humble beginnings to succeed through drive and grit and, yeah, being held accountable? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=169.0s)]
*  Did any of those people need their standards lowered or did they need the bar held high? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, it's pretty obvious. But wait, I digress because liberals have another factor to blame for their students' poor performance. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=187.0s)]
*  It's not absentee parents. It's not screen addiction or COVID closures. It's society's implicit bias. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=194.0s)]
*  Implicit biases. You know, a lot of times teachers will ask students to behave in certain ways, whether it's, you know, you need to sit quietly in your seat. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=203.0s)]
*  Or you need to take notes a particular way. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=211.0s)]
*  How dare students be asked to take notes or to sit in their seats quietly? What exactly are teachers supposed to do here? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=217.0s)]
*  Now, I get it. I got boys, right? I know students sometimes need to get out of their class chairs and do get the wiggles out. I get that, especially when they're little. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=225.0s)]
*  That's a good thing. That's fine. But somehow we all survived and our country thrived with a basic code of conduct in school and some objective guidance on study habits. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=233.0s)]
*  Makes sense. But again, they need to find something to prevent us from assessing where students truly are in their learning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=248.0s)]
*  And thus we could, as taxpayers, determine how effective certain school districts are versus others. They don't want objective measures. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=256.0s)]
*  The left needs the schools to remain propaganda factories. And a dumbed down curriculum means dumbed down students. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=264.0s)]
*  And it also means, they hope, I think, a new generation of activists with little to no understanding of Western civilization or the great works that informed our founders. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=272.0s)]
*  Remember, a long time ago, they determined all of that was racist, again, filled with implicit bias. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=282.0s)]
*  So at that San Francisco School Board meeting a few nights ago, the assistant superintendent pushed the program and tried her best. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=288.0s)]
*  Teachers are really excited about partaking in this. Grading for equity as a term, I think, is a misnomer because it's the end of the road. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=297.0s)]
*  But the practices involved leading up to that are really about learning. So, for example, on an assessment, being able to provide test corrections, retakes, all of that focus is on the partnership between the teacher and the student working together to then demonstrate their learning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=306.0s)]
*  Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents part of the Bay Area, was not pleased to hear this, posting on X. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=325.0s)]
*  My immigrant dad asked me where the missing 10% went when I scored a 20, excuse me, a 90. That was a tough dad, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=332.0s)]
*  He came to America for the chance to work hard and pursue excellence. Giving A's for 80% and no homework is not equity. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=339.0s)]
*  It betrays the American dream and every parent who wants more for their kids. Of course Ro Khanna is right here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=348.0s)]
*  Grading equity also simply betrays common sense, though. Since when is eliminating stress? I love this. We have to eliminate stress in education. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=356.0s)]
*  When the teachers unions run the show, that's when they want to eliminate stress. When kids don't score well, teachers get blamed. They don't like that. Hence why we have so much grade inflation. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=367.0s)]
*  Points are the primary sort of language of learning. Kids talk about points. Teachers talk about points. It can be really stressful for students. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=379.0s)]
*  Okay. I don't believe I ever uttered the words, I'm so stressed when I was in high school. You had work and you did it, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=392.0s)]
*  But remember, the left wants everyone to feel victimized by the system. That's the playbook, especially for minorities. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=402.0s)]
*  Students of color, black students, Latinx, indigenous students and students of lower income. We have really used grading to punish those groups disproportionately because we have particular ways that they should learn. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=410.0s)]
*  Ah, there it is. Listen closely. Grades punish certain kids, minority kids. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=425.0s)]
*  For those precious nuggets of wisdom, San Francisco taxpayers were set to fork over $172,000 to Mr. Feldman in consulting fees. What a racket. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=434.0s)]
*  But it turns out even San Francisco liberals are fed up with this nonsense. There was almost an immediate backlash among parents and others when word got out about this scam. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=448.0s)]
*  The superintendent was forced to backtrack. Her statement in part read, we hold every student to high standards. It's clear that there are a lot of questions, concerns and misinformation with this proposal. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=458.0s)]
*  We want to make sure any changes benefit our students. I've decided not to pursue this strategy for the next year to ensure we have time to meaningfully engage the community. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=469.0s)]
*  Meaningfully engage the community. It's more meaningless verbiage by an education bureaucrat. Now notice she didn't say that they were ending plans for it all together. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=480.0s)]
*  So it looks like a temporary pause, maybe until the outrage subsides. But again, lowering the bar for kids based on race or income, ethnic background, that's cruel. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=492.0s)]
*  That's unjust. That is discriminatory. It's just designed to insulate the schools from the consequences of their own failures and keep the disastrous woke education experiment going. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=505.0s)]
*  I was thinking about this today as I was writing the angle. This is just one more reason of about a million to support statewide school choice programs. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=517.0s)]
*  States like Iowa, Florida, Arizona, Utah, Arkansas are among the 15 states with at least one universal private school choice program. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=526.0s)]
*  And this is parent power. And it's been a huge political winner, my friends, for Republicans. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=535.0s)]
*  But most importantly, it is the right thing to do for parents and for students. This is the real threat to education. Propagandists against students, the teachers unions and the equity flim flam artists. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=540.0s)]
*  That has to be over, finally diminish the influence. But where school choice doesn't yet exist and the public schools still have the monopoly on education for middle class families, parents, they got to be vigilant. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=556.0s)]
*  Attend school board meetings, speak up, organize like minded families, demand to be heard. You're paying the bills. You have a right to speak. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=569.0s)]
*  We've seen this with the trans insanity in Loudoun County, Virginia, and they made changes and you can change minds or at least force these edu crats to back down until they return. Of course, with another dumb idea. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=580.0s)]
*  Democrats are going full MAGA blue MAGA. No, seriously, Democrats are asking themselves, quote, Could blue MAGA revitalize the party? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=593.0s)]
*  We hear they're making blue hats that say make California great again and swapping out the village people for Stevie Wonder. I guess if you just can't beat them, you join them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=603.0s)]
*  Democrats are admitting Trump was right about everything. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=613.0s)]
*  Nobody comes out looking better than Donald Trump and the MAGA right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=616.0s)]
*  Because the things that they were saying, the things that they were accusing the left of the things that they were accusing legacy media of. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=622.0s)]
*  Whether it's true or not, they look right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=632.0s)]
*  They look like they were on point. Democrats have never admitted we were right about anything. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=636.0s)]
*  They never admitted we were right about anything. And now they're admitting we were right about everything. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=641.0s)]
*  I don't even know how to take that. It's never happened before. They're all saying you got us. We lied. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=647.0s)]
*  Democrats just spent four years arguing that the border was fine. Inflation was not a problem. And Joe Biden was up to the job. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=654.0s)]
*  And I think that four years of that message was really harmful. I think there are a lot of reasons why there are crises in confidence in the news media, in Democratic Party, in institutions. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=663.0s)]
*  And I think all of it needs to be hashed out, acknowledged and discussed. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=675.0s)]
*  Was that Tapper or Hannity? This isn't fun anymore. What's the point of having two parties if one side just keeps saying the other side's right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=680.0s)]
*  Did Democrats just surrender? Tapper's even saying we were right about lawfare. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=690.0s)]
*  I think it is problematic when people run for prosecutor and promise to go after a specific politician. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=697.0s)]
*  And both Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, and Alvin Bragg, the District Attorney of New York, both of them did that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=705.0s)]
*  And that, to me, is problematic because you're not saying this is the offense and we need to bring justice to this perpetrator. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=710.0s)]
*  You're saying I'm going to go after him. And I think that there was a degree to which that was tolerated by the media writ large. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=723.0s)]
*  I'm glad he's saying it, but why didn't he say it on his show? The guy was on the air for what, two hours a day? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=732.0s)]
*  CNN called it the trial of the century. Now Tapper's saying, yeah, it was all cooked up by Tish and fat Alvin. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=738.0s)]
*  It's not like this was even covered up. There was tape of Tish and Bragg saying it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=745.0s)]
*  Even morning Joe's admitting Republicans were right about everything. But they're taking credit for it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=750.0s)]
*  If you were a conservative at Harvard Law School, anytime you opened your mouth, you better have thought through it about 20 different times because you were going to get crushed. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=757.0s)]
*  Whereas, and here's the important point, now we talk about why the left may be adrift and at loss. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=767.0s)]
*  The other side of that is the intellectual laziness that every that occurs every time you open your mouth and they all agree with you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=774.0s)]
*  And you're part of group think. So you never have to defend your ideas. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=784.0s)]
*  So when you go out and run a campaign and you think everybody's going to agree with you, it's just the opposite. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=788.0s)]
*  Scarborough is like the bully who picks on a kid and then takes credit when the kid turns out to be a winner. Group think sounds like morning Joe. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=794.0s)]
*  They're not just glazing us. They're turning on each other. Democrats just did what Obama told them to. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=803.0s)]
*  They whacked Biden and Obama's aides ran Kamala's campaign. And now they're realizing the Messiah can't walk on water. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=809.0s)]
*  People are starting to complain. Oh, my God, the Obama people, they're running anything, everything. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get a sense that they think they know everything. They run the world. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=823.0s)]
*  And in some went in some cases, you can understand it because, well, they did win two presidential elections. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=827.0s)]
*  But at a certain point, that class of folks has to start listening to the next generation coming up because they have ideas. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=834.0s)]
*  They have ways of reaching out to the voters, to to men, to the Obama coalition that they just don't have. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=843.0s)]
*  They don't have the feel for it because they're not from that generation. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=850.0s)]
*  He just called Barry a boomer and Chuck Todd said Boomer Barry was the one who ran men out of the party. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=854.0s)]
*  You spent 15 years essentially ignoring that vote. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=862.0s)]
*  And in fact, not only ignoring it, interest groups going out of their way to marginalize. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=867.0s)]
*  That demographic group. And then you're shocked when that demographic group doesn't think the Democratic Party wants them to be members. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=871.0s)]
*  Barack Obama accused the Republican Party of a war on women. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=880.0s)]
*  You remember that Romney had a binder full of women he was trying to hire and they called him sexist. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=884.0s)]
*  Mitt Romney was sexist. Every judge Obama appointed was a woman, which is fine. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=889.0s)]
*  But after a while, I mean, come on. And then they went way overboard with me, too. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=895.0s)]
*  And race relations in the country hit an all time low under Barack. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=901.0s)]
*  Now Democrats are saying maybe we should be nicer to Whitey. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=905.0s)]
*  The white dudes for Harris hat didn't work. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=909.0s)]
*  The DNC is trying to court guys who just want to get laid and have fun. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=912.0s)]
*  Remember? So they sent in Mayor Pete. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=917.0s)]
*  What is bearded Pete think they should be talking about? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=921.0s)]
*  We should be talking about how, yes, if, you know, Speaker Johnson got his way, it wouldn't be possible not just for gay people to get married, but for straight people to get divorced, let alone like birth control or how he would want to regulate porn or whatever. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=925.0s)]
*  People, most people would have a problem with gay marriage, divorce and porn. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=939.0s)]
*  That's Pete's pitch to white guys. Hey, guys, don't forget to wear a condom. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=944.0s)]
*  Look who else they're sending out. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=950.0s)]
*  I love young men. I love guys. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=953.0s)]
*  And in that I've realized, like, even the ones that identify as conservative are almost always pro choice. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=957.0s)]
*  They're almost always pro gay marriage. You'd be surprised at the number of them who support a black lives matter. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=964.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Whenever I'm on campus, I see Black Lives Matter flags hanging from every fraternity house, everyone and trans flags, too. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=970.0s)]
*  The Democrats were better off with tampon. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=977.0s)]
*  It's been six months. Half the party's like, yep, we're all liars and we deserve to lose. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=980.0s)]
*  And the other half's taking a knee for George Floyd. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=986.0s)]
*  Jazzy Crockett and Acosta are dying to go to prison. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=989.0s)]
*  And I'm worried about folks like yourself, Congresswoman, because I have to assume that, you know, of course they would like to arrest you and some of the others who are more outspoken in the House. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=994.0s)]
*  That's that's just me thinking that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1005.0s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  It's sad that people are fearful and that they are looking at people like me and really scared because they know there is a target on my back when you have the president of the United States who consistently drops my name and gets. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  Yeah, what's that all about? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  They all told us Trump had an enemy's list. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  I'm still waiting for the first arrest. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  Who's Trump arrested besides bad hombres in the linebacker in Congress? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1035.0s)]
*  Who? James Comey is making death threats and he's on a book tour and on a beach. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  I'd actually like to see a little bit of retribution. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  Biden pardoned so many cronies, Trump probably has no one left to arrest. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  You're not going to believe who the Democrat power brokers want to nominate. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  Are you ready? Not Newsom. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1055.0s)]
*  Definitely not AOC. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  Rambo. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1059.0s)]
*  If you go have lunch at the grill room or go have lunch at the Capitol Grill or go to anywhere where Obama Clinton types congregate, they're pining for wrong. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  They think Ram is the strongest candidate in many cases. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  A short Jewish millionaire from Chicago and he's 65. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  That is an interesting choice. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  I'm sure the crowds will go wild behind the scenes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  They're putting together a shadow cabinet and some of them still won't even say sorry for the shadow government. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  The former first lady should certainly speak up about what she saw in regards to her husband and when she saw it and what she knew, because I think anybody looking again at the videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common sense can see this was a clear cover up. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1095.0s)]
*  And Joe, Jill Biden was certainly complicit in that cover up. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  The Biden clan lied to the country for four years and they have no remorse. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  We never got somebody that said we should never have done this. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  I can't believe we did it in retrospect. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1126.0s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  How arrogant we were. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  I mean, even you know, there was a top aide, a top White House aide who acknowledged to me that this short 10, 15 minute interview I did with Joe Biden in October 2022. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  He would not have been capable of doing in October 2023. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  That admission was stunning to me, but it did not come with and we really made a mistake. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  We shouldn't have run him. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1153.0s)]
*  What an error. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  I can't believe we did it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  Didn't come up with that. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  Democrats confess they lied, but are saying they do it again. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  They say they prefer a president in a coma controlled by a shadow cabinet over Trump or any Republican. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1163.0s)]
*  Democrats claim they're having a come to Jesus moment, but really they're just trying to sanitize the crime scene and sell books. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1169.0s)]
*  In terms of the left, it's a money grab. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  I mean, that's not the case. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1179.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  This is I don't I don't want to get into where my money comes from. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  But I'm you know, CNN is my main job and that's where my main source of income by far. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  Very few people write books to make money. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1193.0s)]
*  I mean, the idea that I would do this for money is is it's just it's silly and not true. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  Democrats just want to be on the winning side now because being right sells even with all the book buzz. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  Tapper CNN show had its worst month in 10 years. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1210.0s)]
*  The man's in quicksand. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  The more he fights, the deeper he sinks. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1217.0s)]
*  The country is changing. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1219.0s)]
*  A majority of the Democrat voters now think populism is cool. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  They'd rather have populism than promises of abundance that Democrats never deliver on anyway. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  The country wants doers, people with common sense and leaders who tell the truth, not people who lie to them and then write tell alls to make a quick buck. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  You know, the easiest way to make money in this business, tell the truth from the beginning. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1241.0s)]
*  But first tonight, the Democratic Party, they are on life support. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1247.0s)]
*  They have really no leader, one that could win anyway, no direction, no ideas of the future. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1251.0s)]
*  And instead of trying to fix the self-inflicted damage they have caused, they are doubling down on dumb, dumber and stupid and policies and antics that landed them right where they are in the first place. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  Just take a look at this insane equity grading proposal in San Francisco. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1270.0s)]
*  I don't know why I'm laughing. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  I should be crying because it's so wrong. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1277.0s)]
*  We spend more per capita per student than any industrialized country with the worst results. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1279.0s)]
*  I should cry. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  But anyway, now it was ultimately scrapped after facing widespread backlash. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1285.0s)]
*  But listen to what the proposal was that they initially put in place. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1290.0s)]
*  It was set to be tested by 70 teachers across 14 schools. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1293.0s)]
*  Homework, weekly tests, late assignments, tardiness and absences from class would no longer impact a student's grade. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1298.0s)]
*  It would instead be based on a final exam which you could retake and retake and retake multiple times. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  And as if that couldn't get any more ridiculous, it would allow students who score an 80 or above, you get an A. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  When I was in school, an 80 was like a low C. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1323.0s)]
*  Anyway, in students who scored as low as 21% out of 100, they would get a passing D grade. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1325.0s)]
*  If you got 40 out of 100, you'd get a C. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1334.0s)]
*  And not to be outdone, Hawaii Governor Josh Green has now signed into law a new climate tax on tourists. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1337.0s)]
*  By the way, I'm glad I've already been to Hawaii. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1344.0s)]
*  No need to go back and pay it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  Now, this is all in an effort to raise money to fund climate change mitigation. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  The new law will raise the tourist taxes on hotels in Hawaii to an astounding 11%, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  likely destroying the state's tourism industry all in the name of this phony climate change agenda, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  which is a new law even for Democrats. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  And here's what he said after signing this idiotic bill. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1371.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  Hawaii's leaving. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1375.0s)]
*  Hawaii's doing what other states and other nations are going to have to do. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  Because as the climate crisis continues to roll through our planet, and you see it happening, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  we saw it in L.A. not long ago, and they're facing somewhere between $50 and $100 billion of damage, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1386.0s)]
*  there will be no way to deal with these crises without some forward-thinking mechanism. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  I hope that the world is watching because having something that is a balance between industry and environment [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1397.0s)]
*  is going to be the way to go forward to protect your people. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1405.0s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, Radical Squad member AOC is now fundraising on abolishing ICE [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  as President Trump continues to clean up the mess that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Alejandro Mayorkas left at the border. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  In an email to supporters, she said, quote, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  I believe that ICE, an agency that was only formed in 2003 during the Patriot Act era, is a rogue agency that should not exist. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  Oh, let's see. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  Allow the known terrorists, murderers, rapists, other violent criminals, cartel members, gang members. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  Let them stay. Is that the answer? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  And of course, no Democratic playbook is complete without comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and Republicans to Nazis. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  It worked so well in their closing argument before the 24 election. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1451.0s)]
*  This time, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who, by the way, side note, according to recent polling, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  has an approval rating of less than 7 percent, even in deep blue Chicago. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say. Take a look. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1467.0s)]
*  The president has reached our front doors all across America. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1491.0s)]
*  Governor Pritzker, he described the steps and the actions of this president, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  akin to how Nazi Germany became real. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  As the world turns and as Democrats struggle to find their direction, their new leader, Jasmine Crockett, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  once again back in the headlines after she and Jim Acosta pretending that Trump and Republicans want her arrested. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1520.0s)]
*  For the record, you can't make it up. And no, Jasmine, we don't want you arrested. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  We want you to stay on shows like Jim Acosta's and just keep talking and don't stop and be the leader that you are. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1532.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  I'm worried about folks like yourself, Congresswoman, because I have to assume that, you know, of course they would like to arrest you [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  and some of the others who are more outspoken in the House. That's just me thinking that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. It's interesting because my deputy chief, who's quite young, still has his grandmother, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  who he calls this particular one Nene. And so I was having to go to El Paso. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1561.0s)]
*  And his grandmother did not know why we were going to El Paso, but she thought we were going to a detention facility. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  That I don't know about Jasmine going because you know they want to lock her up and they probably don't grab her and throw her in too. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  And so, you know, it is sad that people are fearful. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1584.0s)]
*  Nobody's going to lock up Jasmine Crockett because she has crazy views. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  And I'm going to go on her and AOC and the squad and Grandpa Bernie. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  Just keep talking away. The Democratic Party, their own life support. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1598.0s)]
*  The damage to their brand is now done. It is baked in. It is too big to overcome. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  They have no direction. They have no leader. And frankly, they have no future. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1606.0s)]
*  And instead of doing something that is really needed, like, oh, soul searching, they're just doubling down on dumb, dumber and stupid. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  Zero introspection, zero course correction. And the situation now has become so dire that their friends, even in the liberal state run legacy media mob, aren't even sure what to say or do. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1619.0s)]
*  Look at MSDNC's liberal Joe trying to explain away the Democrats and their recent losses as intellectual laziness and group think. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1631.0s)]
*  Joe, you'd be a part of that, by the way. Just saying. Take a look. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1640.0s)]
*  Now we talk about why the left may be adrift and at loss. The other side of that is the intellectual laziness that every that occurs every time you open your mouth and they all agree with you. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're part of group think. So you never have to defend your ideas. So when you go out and run a campaign and you think everybody's going to agree with you, it's just the opposite. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1658.0s)]
*  You never had to be on your toes before intellectually. And now you do. And you lose elections because of it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  I think we can all agree. I deserve it. Happy Thursday, everyone. So President Trump said the king of Saudi Arabia told him the U.S. is the hottest country in the world right now. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1675.0s)]
*  He had said we were originally number four, but we moved up three spaces after Rosie O'Donnell left. Beautiful woman. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1689.0s)]
*  San Francisco schools attempted to roll out a new equity program where students can pass with scores as low as 21 out of 100 or as students in San Francisco call it close to 50 percent. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1700.0s)]
*  After completing his one hundred and eighty day mission at Doge, Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration. He says he wants to spend more time with his twenty seven families. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. will start aggressively revoking the visas of Chinese students. Great. Now American students will have to cheat off the Indian kids. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  Worse, they're going to have to do their own laundry. Too far, too far, too far. I know Mayor Pete said he wishes he could go back in time and open the schools in 2020. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1747.0s)]
*  Dude, if you could time travel, why not go back to 2018 and give those f*****s in Wu handsome gloves? Yeah. Go back in time and grow a beard. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1767.0s)]
*  According to a new report, Seton Hall's baseball program included hazing rituals that included beatings and forced sex acts. What's the downside? Asked one man. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos is offering a voluntary buyout to staffers at the Washington Post if they're not willing to promote personal liberties in free markets. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1801.0s)]
*  He's also offering a voluntary buyout to staffers who can't stop staring at Lauren Sanchez's cans. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1809.0s)]
*  And finally, according to a new study, weight loss in middle age can add years to your life. Well, I think I speak for everybody when I say dinner's on me, ladies. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  Ladies. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  All right. So the media's been trying to blame the White House for lying to them about Joe Biden's sorry state. But like the hole that I drilled in our green room bathroom. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1836.0s)]
*  Americans see right through it. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1848.0s)]
*  Nice boxers, Dean. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1852.0s)]
*  According to Rasmussen, 63 percent of voters say major media were not fooled and instead helped cover it all up. And 72 percent rate the cover up of Biden's mental meltdown as a quote, serious scandal. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1853.0s)]
*  That's huge. You couldn't get 72 percent of Americans to agree on anything. Except maybe that kill me sucks. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  I know he does. I okay, we get it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1877.0s)]
*  So what's their second spin? Make it about Trump's health, not Biden's. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1881.0s)]
*  President Trump, while he appears healthy, he has not been transparent about his health records. And I think that that's something that the American people have a right to. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1887.0s)]
*  While we didn't know that much about Joe Biden's health, we know even less about Donald Trump's health. He was completely untransparent during the 2023, 2024 campaign. He has not been transparent since. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  And there is no mechanism forcing him or any future president to being transparent about their health. He could be on anything. We really have no ideas. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1911.0s)]
*  Yes, you do, you ass. We didn't know much about Biden's health, but we know even less about Trump's. Dude, we see Trump every single day. We hear his voice. We read his tweets. We hear him when he's not even around. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1923.0s)]
*  The contrast couldn't be more obvious. Trump got shot in the ear and jumped right up while Biden kept losing a fight with gravity. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1941.0s)]
*  And yet that's the lesson you learn now after ignoring Biden all this time. You're turning the real scandal about Joe into a fake scandal about Trump. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1953.0s)]
*  That's like saying, oh, sure. I drilled a hole in the green room bathroom, but Kuglows, he's got a camera in there. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1965.0s)]
*  Or that's like, I don't know, after watching cities get torched after the Floyd riots pivoting to the threat of white supremacy. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1973.0s)]
*  It's all deflection away from the crimes you enabled. So now Tapper claims Trump has not been transparent about his health and taking their cue. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1983.0s)]
*  The usual suspects, CNN, MSNBC, the Atlantic are suddenly very concerned about a presidential health report while conveniently forgetting they propped up a president who once said this. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=1993.0s)]
*  And Joan, the same guy, she's a nice person. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2003.0s)]
*  Shanga. I'm not sure I'm going to do show. Putin's kleptocracy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  Yeah. Kleptocracy. The guys who are the kleptocracy. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  You don't need an M.D. to see Biden was D.O.A. Of course, they couldn't release his medical evaluations since it was on stationary labeled coroner's reports. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2025.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, if Trump is hiding anything, he sucks at it. He's everywhere. Not just healthy, but over the top healthy. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  He may live on McDonald's and Diet Coke, but he runs rings around reporters half his age. Even Politico called Trump just about the most accessible president in modern history. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2046.0s)]
*  It's true. Trump has done media on 111 of his 138 days in office. That's an 80 percent hit rate. He's had more microphones stuck in his face that Pelosi has had needles. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2055.0s)]
*  How many? How many modern presidents would even dare to do that? But Trump rolls out, points to a room full of hostile reporters and says, whose ass can I kick today? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2069.0s)]
*  I haven't had this much fun watching a president since FDR did donuts in the snow in his wheelchair. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  Like yesterday, I wonder if they're saying Trump always chickens out on the tariff threats. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out on your tariff threats. And that's why markets are higher this week. What's your response to that? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  I kick out. Chicken out. Oh, and then I chicken out. I've never heard that. You mean because I reduced China from 145 percent that I set down to 100 and then down to another number. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  And I said, you have to open up your whole country. And because I gave the European Union a 50 percent tax tariff and they called up and they said, please, let's meet right now. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2117.0s)]
*  Please, let's meet right now. You call that chickening out. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2131.0s)]
*  Trump's no chicken, but that reporter got roasted like a Kenny Rogers rotisserie because, you know, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2136.0s)]
*  You know, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia. The king told me, he said, you got the hottest. We have the hottest country in the world right now. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2145.0s)]
*  Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. We had a dead country. We had a country. People didn't think it was going to survive. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2155.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny, but it's not surprising. If you put a lifeless guy in charge, what do you get? The Joe Biden of countries, a nation on life support. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2163.0s)]
*  And you ask a nasty question like that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2173.0s)]
*  You ask a nasty question like that. It's called negotiation. You said that's a nasty question. Go ahead. To me, that's the nastiest question. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  So now the Dems are spiraling and along with them, the complicit media voters are tuning them out and tuning into something new. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2186.0s)]
*  Reality, because every time they try to make it about Trump, he shows up, fires back and takes command. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2193.0s)]
*  He's not running from the issues. He's driving them and he's doing it with energy, humor and the confidence of someone who actually believes America's best days aren't behind us, but in front. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2199.0s)]
*  It's no wonder the mood of the country is shifting. You can feel it for the first time in years. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  People feel like something's actually happening here and it's good. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  So if the media wants to keep yelling about fitness, let them because what most Americans see isn't a brain dead leader. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2218.0s)]
*  It's one full of life giving America much needed CPR followed, of course, by a loving pat on the ass. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytQOEefWqtQ&t=2225.0s)]
