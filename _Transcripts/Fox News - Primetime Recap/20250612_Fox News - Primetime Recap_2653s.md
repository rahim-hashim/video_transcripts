# Fox News Highlights - June 11th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8)
*  Democrats in the wilderness. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Now we're beginning, and I say beginning, to see the outline of Democrats' 2028 battle plan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=6.48s)]
*  It's led by Gavin Newsom and it involves an ideological alliance with the rioters. Yeah, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  people who torch cars, tag entire city blocks, assault law enforcement, and spit on the flag. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=19.76s)]
*  They're not the problem here, but law and order demanded by our law and order president? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=27.52s)]
*  For these Democrats, that's the real problem. And that's what the party's new unofficial leader, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=33.28s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, did last night. As unrest continued to rage across LA with 200 arrested, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=39.28s)]
*  even with the curfew, Newsom found the time to deliver what was essentially a campaign speech. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It was filled with lies, the usual hyperbole, and a dramatic setup of the triggering event. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=52.24s)]
*  Federal agents jumped out of an unmarked van near a Home Depot parking lot. They began grabbing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=59.28s)]
*  people, a deliberate targeting of a heavily Latino suburb. Trump is pulling a military [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=64.72s)]
*  dragnet all across Los Angeles, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=70.64s)]
*  and serious criminals. His agents are arresting dishwashers, gardeners, day laborers, and seamstresses. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=76.96s)]
*  It's the typical litany. It's so dramatic. I'm surprised he didn't say they were all [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  honor roll students. That's another one they love to pull out. But don't forget, despite the fact [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=89.36s)]
*  that Obama deported more than 5.2 million illegals, excuse me, Democrats don't support [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=94.96s)]
*  any deportations, none, zero. They want ICE abolished. Also, ICE officers at the Home Depot [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=101.92s)]
*  had a reasonable suspicion to conduct the raid they were conducting. And when they do these types [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=109.44s)]
*  of raids, they're often executing arrest warrants, and it's all perfectly legal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=115.12s)]
*  And by the way, if you are here illegally and haven't been given subsequent permission to remain [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=120.08s)]
*  here, you are subject to deportation, period. And you're probably one of the people who run [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=125.6s)]
*  when ICE shows up. Everyone else, just continue working at your construction site or your [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=131.84s)]
*  restaurant or wherever it is. You have nothing to worry about. But Gavin has a 2028 primary to win. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=137.12s)]
*  And so last night, he needed to get up on his high horse and trash Trump. And he had to do it better [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=143.6s)]
*  and more potently than any other potential contender, with an indignant sneer on his face [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=150.0s)]
*  and delivery as well. The argument was so stupid that Trump somehow wanted violence to occur. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=155.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, without consulting California law enforcement leaders, commandeered 2,000 of our [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=164.0s)]
*  state's National Guard members to deploy on our streets illegally and for no reason. He doubled [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=171.44s)]
*  down on his dangerous National Guard deployment by fanning the flames even harder. And the president, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=177.36s)]
*  he did it on purpose. Okay, first, it wasn't illegal. And a federal judge yesterday rejected [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  Newsom's request for that emergency injunction against Trump and the deployment of the Marines [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=189.84s)]
*  and so forth. Second, has this Newsom guy ever read the Constitution? It's called the Supremacy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=195.52s)]
*  Clause. Look it up. Article 6, clause 2, it says that the Constitution, federal laws, treaties [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=201.68s)]
*  are the supreme law of the land. In other words, federal immigration law trumps state concerns. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=207.2s)]
*  So it's the president's right, it's his duty to enforce our laws and remove all those people who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=215.04s)]
*  are here without authorization. Whether they're violent criminals or whether they've simply ignored [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=220.24s)]
*  previous deportation orders or whether they're just hanging around a Home Depot, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=226.72s)]
*  whether they're single or married with children, it doesn't matter. You are unauthorized to be here, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=232.0s)]
*  you must leave. And if you don't leave, they'll make you leave. That's what the people want. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=237.68s)]
*  And Newsom knows all this. He's not a stupid person, he's annoying, but he's not stupid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=243.12s)]
*  But he's speaking to his nutbag constituents and future Democrat voters who are foaming at the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=247.76s)]
*  mouth over Trump. Of course, regular Americans, they hate this stuff. I can't tell you how many [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=254.48s)]
*  people came up to me today. We're just like, can you believe what's happening in L.A.? These [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=259.68s)]
*  aren't political people. Normal Americans, they don't see the violence swirling across our cities [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=263.12s)]
*  and say to themselves, huh, if they only sent the military or law enforcement home, then things [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=269.52s)]
*  would be quiet. But Newsom's betting on people being really, really stupid. But the polling, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=276.8s)]
*  it's clear. Americans want law and order. They support President Trump's handling of this, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=284.32s)]
*  and they still support mass deportations. According to CBS, 54% approve of Trump deporting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=290.0s)]
*  illegal immigrants and 42% say his deportation program is making people safer. The message, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=298.24s)]
*  Gavin is delivering? Well, this wouldn't happen if I were president. And we all know that if Newsom [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=306.24s)]
*  ever ended up in the White House, well, the entire country would become a sanctuary for illegals. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  But my question is, if he has this secret sauce, including no immigration raids and open borders, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=320.56s)]
*  then why are so many businesses and so many families leaving California? But logic isn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=327.6s)]
*  something Gavin's really interested in at this point. This situation was winding down and was [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=334.72s)]
*  concentrated in just a few square blocks downtown. But that that's not what Donald Trump wanted. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  He again chose escalation. He chose more force. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=347.6s)]
*  moment we have feared has arrived. Oh, my God. Back to the democracies and paroled argument [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=355.12s)]
*  that flamed out with Joe and Kamala last year. But as their ideological bedfellows literally [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=361.6s)]
*  threatened to burn it all down. Okay, what's what's anti-democratic? Because that's what the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  voters want. Yeah. Socialists, Marxists, anarchists, open borders radicals flying the Mexican flag. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=374.48s)]
*  They are the epitome of enemies of democracy. America sees Trump as being proactive. He's a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=382.48s)]
*  city guy. He loves America's once great cities like Los Angeles, and he doesn't want it to fall [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=390.08s)]
*  into an abyss. Of course not. But back to Newsom, he delivered his impetuous remarks as a preemptive [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  marker for twenty twenty eight. He knows he's walking on on the edge here. He knows it to win [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=402.24s)]
*  the twenty twenty eight primary. He can't risk offending nut jobs on the far left who literally [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=408.24s)]
*  believe ice officers are Nazi stormtroopers, can't offend them. After all, he may end up on the same [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=413.36s)]
*  stage as radical pinup girl AOC. Notice, by the way, we aren't hearing much, at least from some [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=419.2s)]
*  of the other potential contenders like J.B. Pritzker or Gretchen Whitmer. Where are they? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, they're petrified. They don't know what to do. Imagine these Democrat Party primaries [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=433.12s)]
*  in twenty twenty eight. I'm thinking about that today. Crazies are going to demand pledges. You [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=438.32s)]
*  know, raise your hand if you agree with total amnesty for all 40 million and its 40 million, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=443.04s)]
*  at least, illegals here. Oh, sorry. Undocumented Democrats here. These folks, though, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=448.88s)]
*  they're headed to the political wilderness and there's precedent for this. When a party cements [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  its image as weak and ineffective, it spells bad news for that party. From 1968 until 1992, Democrats [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=461.36s)]
*  were shut out of the White House in five out of six presidential elections. The public simply [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=469.36s)]
*  came to the view that the Democrat Party was weak. It was soft on communism and terrible on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=475.76s)]
*  handling the economy. In 68, Hubert Humphrey lost to Nixon, who promised to restore law and order. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=481.2s)]
*  In 72, McGovern got smoked. Nixon was reelected by a 23 point margin. And of course, you know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  the Reagan triumph over Carter in 80. Now, Carter was a very nice man, but weak across the board. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=494.72s)]
*  And his cardigan speech, that didn't work simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=500.8s)]
*  degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night. We could save half the current shortage of natural [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=506.72s)]
*  gas. Mondale in 84, another wipeout for Democrats and of course, Dukakis in 88. Who can forget his [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=513.2s)]
*  tank fiasco? Bush 41 sailed to victory by 12 points. Sorry, they were all losers. As things stand now, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=521.36s)]
*  Democrats are also setting themselves up for the same losing streak. They're weak on crime, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=530.88s)]
*  weak on the border and weak on America. And that's the angle. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=536.0s)]
*  L.A.'s rioting, our flags are burning and Democrats are struggling to pick a side. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, they said it was the Mexican-American war all over again, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=546.32s)]
*  and they wanted us to give California back. Now they say it's the Civil War. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=550.4s)]
*  I remember a few standups ago when I talked about what terrorism looks like. This is it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  There should be no question to what our country would look like had the Confederacy won. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=564.64s)]
*  We're seeing it on full display. The Civil War started when Democrats resisted federal law [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=570.16s)]
*  and attacked federal troops. Isn't that how the L.A. riots started? I guess Democrats are [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=575.76s)]
*  going back to their roots and they're looking for a general. Gavin Newsom's hopping on his high horse [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=581.52s)]
*  and leading the charge. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=587.84s)]
*  are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=594.24s)]
*  has arrived. Hiding in a bunker, releasing pre-recorded videos saying democracy's under [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=602.64s)]
*  assault. Who does that remind me of? The big guy. Gavin's just emasculated because Trump reached [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=608.48s)]
*  into his state and ordered his guard to protect the people he couldn't or wouldn't. Ice raids are [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=615.92s)]
*  democracy. That's what the country voted for. Trump's ambassador to Hollywood has had enough [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=622.24s)]
*  of the hair grease. You're a fool blaming Trump. What are you doing for this destruction of these [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=628.72s)]
*  animals destroying Los Angeles? Are you there talking calmly with them? You fool. They would [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=639.76s)]
*  burn you down like they're burning the cars and the American flag with no regard for humanity. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=646.4s)]
*  This is not about Trump. This is about protecting the people from these animals and criminals, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=653.2s)]
*  trying to destroy us and our police force. Are they supposed to stand there, let rocks hit them [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=658.96s)]
*  and kill them? Who's going to save them? You. You're a disgrace. You're nothing but a lying dog for [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=665.44s)]
*  the hopes of becoming the president one day. Gavin whining about democracy is exactly what [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=672.24s)]
*  Democrats shellacked last year. The dictator hoax didn't fly. What did? Sovereignty. Democrats think [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  they lost because of trans. They really lost because of Biden migrants. The LA riots have [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=685.04s)]
*  nothing to do with Donald Trump. He lives in DC. He didn't melt waymo's and loot sushi joints. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  Illegals are fire bombing the LA freeway and Democrats are calling Trump the terrorist. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=697.76s)]
*  This is absolutely unconscionable. What's going on? I had never thought in my life that I would be [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=703.84s)]
*  seeing this sort of disruption in this sort of terrorism attack on our, on our citizens, on our [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=709.12s)]
*  community. The National Guard's not the one torching cars and waving Mexican flags around [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=714.8s)]
*  on dirt bikes. They called ICE the Gestapo, the police Nazis and the National Guard terrorists. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=719.92s)]
*  These politicians are actually fire bombing their own party. Trump's the only one doing the job. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=727.12s)]
*  Are you going to arrest Gavin Newsom? Well, he's not doing a good job. You know, arrest, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=733.52s)]
*  what does that mean? He's not doing a good job. Charge him? Well, in theory you could, I guess. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=738.8s)]
*  You know, it's almost like a dissipation of duty. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=745.6s)]
*  Arrest. What does that mean? Well, it means what they did to him. Trump's not going to give Gavin [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=751.04s)]
*  a mugshot. It would make him the nominee and Republicans would rather run against AOC. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=757.36s)]
*  Democrats are letting their cities burn and they're suing the guy trying to stop it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  Gavin thinks if his city burns, he just keeps blaming Trump and his numbers are going to go up. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  Burn down your own town for likes. That's a new one. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  Federman is now the Democrats' voice of reason. We should have learned the lesson back in 2020. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. There was righteous outrage over what happened to George Floyd, but that never mean that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  you can support or be quiet if there's this destruction or rioting and destroying and looting. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=788.32s)]
*  Trump learned his lesson from 2020. He's not going to wait for Democrat governors to stop riots. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  He's going to put them down this time before Americans die. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  What we have is a situation in Los Angeles that was caused by gross incompetence. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  They didn't have the police to handle it. The police were asking us to come in. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=809.2800000000001s)]
*  They were very late. We had to go in to save a lot of ice officers, as you know, who were [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=812.96s)]
*  held up. They were holed up in a building and they were being attacked and the military went in. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=817.68s)]
*  The National Guard went in and got them. The police weren't able, unfortunately, to move fast enough, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=823.28s)]
*  but we moved fast enough and while we were there, we stayed there and we we stopped tremendous [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=828.16s)]
*  destruction and death. Maxine Waters, no relation, is telling the National Guard to shoot her in the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=833.92s)]
*  face. Even CNN was like, seriously? What are you going to do? You're going to shoot some kid [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=840.4s)]
*  who's afraid of you at work? You're going to shoot an election official? If you shoot me, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=846.64s)]
*  you better shoot straight. You then also urged guardsmen not to shoot people. Is yelling at them [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=851.36s)]
*  to shoot straight if they're going to shoot you the right way to show that concern? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=859.36s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't know, but what I was really trying to do was to get, you know, the attention [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=863.12s)]
*  to the seriousness of what was going on. Maxine Waters just admitted she's doing this all for [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=871.6s)]
*  attention. You're not supposed to say that, Ms. Waters, and the riots have gotten plenty of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=878.16s)]
*  attention because their riots were all paying attention. And while she has our attention, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=883.2s)]
*  what's her position on the border or on crime or deportations? CNN doesn't even ask her. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=890.96s)]
*  Everyone's looking on their phones all day and sees LA up in smoke. MSNBC says it's a cheap fake. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=898.48s)]
*  The facts are that Los Angeles is calming down, that there are no riots in the streets. The tale [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=906.56s)]
*  of two cities is being told by the media. It's admit we know this, we're in this business, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=914.0s)]
*  but the impact of pictures that people see on their TV tell a story that's not really accurate. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=919.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, the flames, the cars being burned, the police being thrown, you know, concrete blocks [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  at the police. That's been taken care of by the Los Angeles Police Department. He said there's no [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=931.5200000000001s)]
*  riots and then he listed everything you do in a riot. But he says it's over. But how is it over [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=936.6400000000001s)]
*  if we're covering it now for six nights? It went from peaceful to mostly peaceful to a riot to no [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=943.68s)]
*  more riot because the LAPD put it down. But didn't they have a lot of help from the National Guard? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=950.4s)]
*  Yeah, they did. The View says there was never any violence. I spoke to about five people that live [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=957.12s)]
*  in LA that work in LA and they said that these protests were very, very orderly. They weren't [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=964.8s)]
*  violent and they occurred in about a four block radius. Sunny's sources say there was no violence. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=973.76s)]
*  Do her sources have TVs? Late night says it's the same thing that happens when the Lakers win. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  There's a riot outside. We have more so-called unrest here when one of our teams wins a championship. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=988.4799999999999s)]
*  But that's not what you're seeing on TV. Someone sets a fire in a garbage can. 12 camera crews go running toward it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=994.8s)]
*  Since when does the mayor issue a citywide curfew because someone set a fire in a garbage can? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1001.52s)]
*  Mayor Baz says her city isn't on fire but the only way to stop the fire is for ICE to leave. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  I think that the idea that what is going on here is chaos and we need federal intervention [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1015.68s)]
*  is just not accurate. It doesn't paint an accurate picture of what's going on here at all. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1022.96s)]
*  And really what is going to help would be an end to the raids. For a city not to know when, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1028.88s)]
*  where, how or why raids take place, you can imagine that the entire population of immigrants [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1036.56s)]
*  is very unsettling. So the city doesn't know when raids take place because they're a sanctuary city [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1043.44s)]
*  and you won't cooperate. Now if ICE gives you a heads up, the riots would be bigger. They all [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1050.3200000000002s)]
*  say we should only deport criminals but then they won't let us. When illegals get arrested, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  we ask LA to hold them in jail and then they release them. Imagine how easy it would be if [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  ICE could just walk into the LA County jail, pick up the bad hombres and fly them home. LA is asking [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1066.72s)]
*  for cooperation and they're the ones not cooperating. Tampon said he didn't want the guard to come in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1072.64s)]
*  in Minneapolis after George Floyd and in seven days the city was burnt to a crisp. Millions of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1079.52s)]
*  dollars in damage and citizens dead. Bass was going to pull a tampon and let it burn and now [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1085.28s)]
*  she wants taxpayers to bail her out. We are one year away from the World Cup. This is about [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1092.0s)]
*  beautifying our city and bringing our city together and so I am calling on business leaders, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1098.32s)]
*  community leaders, faith leaders to come together downtown in the next few days to talk about how [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1104.0s)]
*  we are going to clean up the city. Whoa, if there's no chaos, what do you need to clean up? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1110.8s)]
*  Does the entire city of LA usually come clean up after the Lakers win a championship? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1117.12s)]
*  No. Karen Bass shouldn't have given her cops stand down orders. Then Trump wouldn't have had to call [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1122.96s)]
*  in the guard. And if Trump calling in the National Guard is what causes riots, how are they rioting [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1129.28s)]
*  in Seattle and New York? The guard isn't even there. But he will call them in if he asks to. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1135.36s)]
*  Most of the country approves. Trump's up 20 points on his guard move. Look at that. Trump's going to [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1141.92s)]
*  protect cities like women, whether they like it or not. What's the Democrat solution besides burn, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1147.84s)]
*  baby burn? Give 20 million illegal citizenship? That's what they want. But most of them are just [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1153.76s)]
*  afraid to say it. Stephen A. smells a red wave. Next thing Republicans are going to say is, you [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1160.24s)]
*  know, they're for lawlessness, right? They're going to show these images. They're going to say [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1166.48s)]
*  they're for lawlessness. Folks are going to buy it, hook, line and sinker. And their issues of safety [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1171.2s)]
*  is going to usurp any other concerns they have. I'm talking about the voters. And before you know it, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1177.52s)]
*  Dems are going to lose the midterms. They're not going to regate any seats in the House or the Senate. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1187.28s)]
*  And Trump will be able to operate with relative impunity to 2028. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1193.04s)]
*  Well, tonight America's top Democrats, you know, the ones that were all obsessed about January 6 [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1196.8s)]
*  for years and years, they are doing absolutely nothing at all to calm tensions in major cities, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1201.68s)]
*  which have already been, you know, wrecked by looting and arson and other acts of violence. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1209.28s)]
*  Instead, similar to what we saw in the summer of love in 2020, they're just adding fuel to the fire [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1215.28s)]
*  with one recycled smear campaign after another against President Trump. The talking points have [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1221.1200000000001s)]
*  now gone out. And almost everyone in the state-run legacy media mob, the radical left Democratic [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1226.96s)]
*  Party, they're telling the American people Trump is a dictator, a threat to democracy. Democracy is [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1233.76s)]
*  in peril and on the line. And don't believe the violence that you see day in and day out, night in, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1240.32s)]
*  night out, with your own eyes. They are lying to you. They are cheap fake videos. And the riots, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1246.48s)]
*  they are mostly peaceful. And everything is all Donald Trump's fault. Now, we have heard these [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1252.88s)]
*  smears over and over again. By the way, a lot of good, this did Democrats and the left-wing media [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1258.24s)]
*  mob during the election of 24. Let's just keep lying to the American people and simply expect [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1263.0400000000002s)]
*  a different result. That would be the definition of insanity. This is why Democrats lost in 24, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  why the legacy media died on November 5th of 24, and they're officially dead. People no longer [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1275.2800000000002s)]
*  listen to them. They don't believe them. And for good reason, they don't trust them. Remember, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1282.0s)]
*  these are the same people. They all lied. They all said the border is closed, the border is secure, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1286.56s)]
*  and Joe Biden is his best self and so cognitively strong. And those are cheap fake videos that [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1292.32s)]
*  they're running about Joe Biden. Now, this time, the reasoning is even more ridiculous. Apparently, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1298.4s)]
*  Democrats and democracy is in peril for three things. One, Donald Trump is enforcing America's [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1303.92s)]
*  immigration laws. That would be the rule of law. That would be his constitutional duty and [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1310.16s)]
*  deporting people who are here illegally, prioritizing those who are convicted of heinous crimes, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1315.68s)]
*  those murderers, rapists, known terrorists, cartel members, et cetera, et cetera. And two, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1321.92s)]
*  Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to protect federal buildings and federal workers [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1328.4s)]
*  from rioters in Los Angeles. Three, the president organized a military parade to celebrate the Army's [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1333.2s)]
*  250th birthday this weekend. Now, of course, every fake resistant movement, they need an [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1339.2s)]
*  equally superficial leader. And tonight, look who they've chosen. None other than the sanctuary [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1345.52s)]
*  state leader himself, Governor Gavin Newsom. And Governor Newsom is desperate for the spotlight, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1351.44s)]
*  loving every minute of it. And that doesn't mean he's on the ground with the people and law [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1357.92s)]
*  enforcement in LA leading a movement to bring peace to a state's largest city. No. Instead, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1362.0s)]
*  after spending the first few days of the LA riots getting into fights on X with people like me and [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1368.56s)]
*  others and appearing on every left-wing legacy media outlet in the country like MSDNC, by the way, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  he even had time for podcasters. Newsom got in front of, and by the way, not big podcasters, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1381.36s)]
*  Newsom got in front of another camera last night to deliver an impassioned plea all against Donald [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1387.2s)]
*  Trump. Talk about Trump derangement syndrome. Donald Trump takes up more space in Gavin's mind [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1393.2s)]
*  than, you know, pretty much anybody ever has taken up in anybody's mind. Although they did have a lot [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1398.8s)]

*  he's on the ground helping the people of Los Angeles and offering moral support to law enforcement. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1410.32s)]
*  Now, the governor was tired from all the interviews he was doing. The governor who barred Californians [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1416.16s)]
*  from attending church banned all indoor singing in 2020 while he himself was eating out French [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1420.88s)]

*  the First Amendment. Now, by the way, nobody cares what people say. It's what they do that we're [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1438.16s)]
*  talking about. Newsom insisted, quote, the founding fathers did not live and die to see this moment. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1443.1200000000001s)]
*  That's right. They didn't live and die to see states like California destroyed by people like [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1449.76s)]
*  him. Now, this dramatic, moralistic, pre-rehearsed tirade by Gavin Newsom was a response to President [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1455.28s)]
*  Trump's use of the National Guard and the U.S. Marines to protect federal buildings, federal [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1462.8799999999999s)]

*  sanctuary city laws in Los Angeles, local law enforcement is not allowed to aid and help and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1476.08s)]
*  assist federal agents that they were the ones that were under assault. Stephen Miller points this out. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1482.48s)]
*  According to Gavin Newsom, this is what founders were fighting for. Rioters were waving foreign [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1489.1999999999998s)]
*  flags, lighting cars on fire, looting stores because Donald Trump is actually enforcing [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1495.36s)]
*  this country's immigration law. Look at your screen. These are some of the criminal [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1501.28s)]
*  illegal aliens. Gavin, I've sent this to you. You have it. You've watched it. You asked me to carry [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  your speech last night. Gavin, answer the people of California. Call the families of the victims [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1515.52s)]
*  on the screen. Put it up full so people can actually read it, you know, because you allowed [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1522.56s)]
*  this and aid and abet and assist these people. You give them free health care and education in [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1528.64s)]
*  your state of California. You and Democrats are fighting to protect people. Yes, some of them are [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  killers and rapists and gang members and child molesters and Gavin Newsom and leading Democrats. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1540.4s)]
*  Guess what? They're leading the movement to help keep them in the country as they sat idly by while [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1547.68s)]
*  12, 20 million, whatever the number is, of illegal immigrants were entering our country [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1554.24s)]

*  health care in the state of California. No wonder why they're borrowing money from Medi-Cal. And by [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1570.48s)]
*  the way, other states contribute to health care out there. That has to stop. Once again, Democrats [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  are taking the most extreme, the most unpopular position imaginable. Look at this new poll, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1581.36s)]
*  Matt Towery, insider advantage. By the way, this guy actually nailed the 2016 presidential election, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1586.32s)]
*  2020 and 2024. 59% of voters approve of Donald Trump's decision to send in the guard to California. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1591.9199999999998s)]
*  Only 39% disagree. At the same time, 70% of Americans disapprove of D.C. Democrats and by [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1600.56s)]
*  and large people just want simple things. They want good schools where the kids learn reading, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1609.04s)]
*  writing, math, science, arithmetic and computers. They want stable jobs. Oh, Donald Trump has 10 [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1615.2s)]
*  trillion manufacturing that will be created for prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals and chips [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1621.68s)]
*  and everything else and automobile manufacturing, all coming back to the country. And guess what? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  They don't want men playing in women's sports, Gavin, and all you coastal elites cramming woke [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1634.96s)]
*  politics into every corner of everybody's everyday life. They're sick of it. Gavin, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1640.48s)]
*  nobody wants to be told what cars to drive and put in their driveway. We don't want to be told we [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1646.08s)]
*  can't have a gas stove. We don't want you to lecture us about our refrigerators, our AC units, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1651.44s)]
*  and the fact that most people don't want crappy paper straws. We prefer plastic. They, you know, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1657.44s)]
*  people want safety. They want security. They want a secure border. They want a majority of Americans. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1663.92s)]
*  What everybody wants, they want illegal immigrants deported. I don't care if you come to this country. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1669.28s)]
*  I'm the product of immigrants. All four of my grandparents came legally from Ireland. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1675.04s)]
*  Go through the process. Do it legally. I don't really give a rip where you come from. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1680.16s)]
*  Welcome to our country. Give us time to vet you. Let's do a background check. Don't be a financial [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  burden on the American people and come in legally. And by the way, Americans do not want illegal [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1690.88s)]
*  immigrants prioritized over the lives of law enforcement and the people in their state like [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  California. This is why I've been telling you generational, transformational, there's a huge [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1705.2s)]
*  political shift unfolding before our eyes in this country. Democratic, Democratic party, they have [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  lost the plot. Remember, it wasn't long ago. Democrats sounded just like president Trump on [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1717.92s)]
*  illegal immigration. Take a look. All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1723.3600000000001s)]
*  but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1730.16s)]
*  entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1736.24s)]
*  The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration is [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1742.24s)]
*  moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1747.76s)]
*  by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1752.96s)]
*  by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1765.28s)]
*  permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1771.6s)]
*  more to stop it. Bill Clinton sounds like Donald Trump. Boy, have times changed. Democrats have [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1777.52s)]
*  since traded in sound policy, common sense for utter lunacy and insanity. Listen to the Chicago [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1785.6s)]
*  mayor, Brandon Johnson. Listen to this. They're terrified. They are absolutely terrified. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1791.68s)]
*  And that's, look, I remember a few standups ago when I talked about what terrorism looks like. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1799.04s)]
*  This is it. There should be no question to what our country would look like had the Confederacy won. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1806.88s)]
*  We're seeing it on full display. People being terrorized are law enforcement, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1814.24s)]
*  the law-abiding people of Los Angeles that deserve to be protected by their government. By the way, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1819.28s)]
*  Mayor Johnson, he has a whopping 6.6 approval rating. Great job, Mr. Mayor. Democratic Party, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1824.56s)]
*  they are in shambles. The DNC already holding a re-election for two of their vice chairs, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  including David Hogg, after nonstop drama and infighting. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1836.48s)]
*  Chuckie Schumer, his approval rating is at a 20-year low, 17%. Great job, Chuckie. And today, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1842.48s)]
*  he ran from the cameras when he was asked about the violent riots. Take a look. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1848.96s)]
*  Senator, what do Democrats mean when they say that the LA protests are peaceful? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1853.28s)]
*  Senator, what do Democrats mean when they say that LA protests are peaceful? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1858.32s)]
*  Do you consider burning private property peaceful? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1864.08s)]
*  Now, there's a guy who I know well. He never ran away from a television camera his entire life. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1867.76s)]
*  Now, tonight I do have some good news for the Democratic Party. No matter how incompetent, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1874.24s)]
*  unpopular, dishonest, weird, and bizarre they have become. They're friends in the legacy media mob, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1879.4399999999998s)]
*  they're always going to have their backs. And today, as per usual, predictably, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1887.04s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt forcefully, powerfully confronted the latest [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1891.76s)]
*  smear campaign against President Trump. Take a look. So if there were peaceful protests on [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1897.12s)]
*  Saturday for the military parade, President Trump would allow that? Of course the President [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1901.92s)]
*  supports peaceful protests. What a stupid question. What a stupid question. And there [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  were a lot of them today. But fellow Dems are marching behind him with bricks in hand. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1911.04s)]
*  Nancy compared Trump's decision to, of course, Jan 6th. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1916.8s)]
*  In a bipartisan way, on January 6th, with violence against the Constitution, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1921.84s)]
*  against the Congress, and against the United States Capitol, we begged the President of the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1929.52s)]
*  United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  That statement is about as authentic as Dylan Mulvaney's landing strip. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if she owned an airport. She owned an airport. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  Fact is, Pelosi held the Guard back, so Jan 6th could be more chaotic and uglier, which it was. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1954.72s)]
*  But Republicans are different. Yes, if we held back the National Guard, L.A. would burn to the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1961.52s)]
*  ground, and perhaps there'd never be another Liberal governor or mayor again. But we put [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1966.56s)]
*  people before politics. The Dems, however, just keep the gaslighting train rolling. Right, Maxine? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1971.84s)]
*  Nobody was shot. Nobody was killed. Get it in your head. Don't think that somehow, because they [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1978.96s)]
*  called out the National Guard, there was violence. There was no violence. I was on the street. I know. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1985.04s)]
*  Sorry, Maxine. Something was indeed shot and killed, and it landed on your head. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=1991.6s)]
*  Love her. But she wasn't the only violence denier. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2004.56s)]
*  The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful. There are always a few bad actors. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2009.6s)]
*  Local law enforcement has said they can handle the protests. It's no different than when a team wins a [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2014.8s)]
*  national championship and people get overexcited and they overturn vehicles and light them on fire. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2019.6s)]
*  Please. Even Philadelphia Eagles fans are like, we only destroyed things for a few hours. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2026.9599999999998s)]
*  So while Dems try to win back voters, they expand their opposition by labeling all law [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2035.76s)]
*  enforcement action as authoritarian. Pretty soon their party will consist of Hamas, Antifa, and Cat [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2041.28s)]
*  Ladies. If a jeweler calls the cops to protect his store, the Dems will think, well, he's the problem. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2047.36s)]
*  Like they did with pro-Hamas campus protests, BLM riots, and Daniel Penny. The only difference, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2054.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump won't abandon law enforcement. If you're looking for a repeat of 2020, I'm sorry to say [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2060.72s)]
*  your dream is as dead as George Floyd. You don't know which George Floyd I mean. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2066.56s)]
*  Even legal immigrants support Trump. Take it away, Harry. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2078.08s)]
*  Immigrant voters, foreign-born voters have gone tremendously to the right on this issue in 2024 [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2082.56s)]
*  and 2025 versus where they were in 2020. Closest to or trust more in immigration. You go back to [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2088.48s)]
*  2020. Democrats, get this, held a 32-point lead on this issue. Immigrant voters were in the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2092.96s)]
*  Democratic camp. Jump forward to 2024, 2025. Look at that shift, a 40-point shift to the right among [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2098.6400000000003s)]
*  immigrant voters. Republicans now lead on this issue by eight points over Democrats. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2106.64s)]
*  It makes sense. If you waited your turn, why would you be happy about a bunch of jerks cutting the [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2114.0s)]
*  line? So why are the Dems and the media shocked by this? Well, because unlike the left, immigrants [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  don't shout their beliefs every time there's a break in conversation. Hell, I rarely even flex [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2126.0s)]
*  my muscles unless it's a conversation about my muscles. But the left lives in a bubble where [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2131.28s)]

*  evidence proving otherwise. If you don't respond to the riots, you get days, weeks, even months of [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2175.44s)]
*  more rioting. It never stops because lawlessness leads to more lawlessness. So the riots aren't a [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2182.16s)]
*  protest against authoritarianism, they're a protest against order. Once you conflate order with [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2188.64s)]
*  authoritarianism, you get chaos and destruction. So if restoring order is evil, then the Dems are [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2195.2799999999997s)]

*  it's not a felony. So they immediately back down, but the thing is, they're almost right, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  because with asylum law the way it is, it almost is not illegal to cross the border, the way we've [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2353.6s)]
*  set these things up, because we've been party to these ridiculous international agreements, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2359.6s)]
*  international law is totally fake, it's ridiculous, because certain countries obey [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2364.48s)]
*  international law, and then certain countries don't, and we are towing the line on international [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2370.64s)]
*  law, and we allow, in more than even the spirit of the law, we allow people to come in here, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2375.68s)]
*  claim asylum, and then stay here, that's been the whole problem, people come in, they process them, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2380.48s)]
*  they let them run about the country, and then we never are able to get rid of them, that's what's [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2384.56s)]
*  happening now, and everyone's upset about it, and that's why these riots started, they are rioting, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2388.4s)]
*  because it's all coming to a head, and now they're trying to blame Trump for sending in the troops [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2393.92s)]
*  and stop the rioting. Alright, alright, enough out of you. Wow, that never ends. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2398.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, you should leave right now, because that's the best applause you're gonna get. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2418.8s)]
*  It's the best I'm gonna get. What do you make of this idea that any kind of law enforcement [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2421.44s)]
*  somehow is fascist, like any reaction to restore order? It always comes down to, with the Dems, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2426.88s)]
*  is bad leadership at every single level, it's this thing they've made, they've made their own bed of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2434.56s)]
*  one relaxed immigration, or not relaxed, non-existent immigration, apart from yours truly, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2441.28s)]
*  I'm an immigrant, and it's pretty hard, I can tell you that, is they've, again, open border, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2446.64s)]
*  and then, not just in the LA where it's, anything goes, no one's gonna get prosecuted, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2453.92s)]
*  you also have the fact that if you have four years of the previous administration, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2460.8799999999997s)]
*  and so there's a whole generation of people, there's a whole lot of scumbags out there, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2465.3599999999997s)]
*  who don't understand, **** around and find out. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  His first, his first effort on TV. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2476.64s)]
*  That's true, that's true. I feel like a proud dad, and he just rode his bicycle off, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2483.12s)]
*  without the training wheels. First time **** on TV, and he says, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2489.04s)]
*  I've waited two years for that. They said, they said, **** that, I could do it. Someone else said, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2496.96s)]
*  I could do it. It was not me. That's what happened, it always goes back to lawlessness. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2502.56s)]
*  Yeah. There we go. You know what's interesting though? What's so funny, Emily? Tyrus. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2510.4s)]
*  I'm so happy, thank you. You know what just occurred to me, is that, you know, he's an [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2514.96s)]
*  immigrant from England, you don't hear other countries criticizing what Trump's doing, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2518.48s)]
*  because they have the same problem, and they want this option, I mean, England's not talking about [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2524.08s)]
*  it, Germany's not talking about it, France certainly isn't talking about it. It's an interesting point [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2529.68s)]
*  that I just brought up, Emily, I hope you find it interesting, and respond to it in a way that I see fit. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2534.0s)]
*  Quite right, perfect point. But you don't have to answer that, say whatever you want. Well, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2539.8399999999997s)]
*  I was going to say that it's so rich and ironic that Pelosi, just this week, is saying that January [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2544.8799999999997s)]
*  6th, acknowledging that it was violent, it was violence against the Constitution, against the [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2550.08s)]
*  United States, against law enforcement, she says, but then what's LA? They're continuing to say that's [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  not violent, and then Maxine Waters comes out just exactly a year ago, June of 2024, called all Trump [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2559.12s)]
*  supporters domestic terrorists, and that we should be investigated, but then says the streets are [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2565.44s)]
*  peaceful, because just today the DOJ prosecuted a handful of people for throwing Molotov cocktails [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2570.08s)]
*  at law enforcement vehicles, and what I love about this is that the new sheriff in town is one that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2576.0s)]
*  brings with him a whole cabinet and a whole administration that is saying if you mess around, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2581.44s)]
*  you're gonna find out, like it's not just someone with words. That's how you're supposed to do it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2586.4s)]
*  He doesn't know me yet. You did it right, you did it right. I'm just trying to be well-behaved in front of our [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2591.52s)]
*  first-time guest, and so I love this because people like Gavin Newsom, all they did was talk big, but [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2597.52s)]
*  there's no actions here. The last time someone threw a Molotov cocktail here in this city, by the way, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2603.04s)]
*  yet there, and by the way, there were four officers inside, she got six years in prison. Yeah. 2020, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  they finally got sentenced years later that summer. All of those guys got five and a half years, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2613.04s)]
*  three and a half years, etc. That's a big deal. So now we're seeing, my point is, the enforcement [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2618.4s)]
*  of the laws, the prosecution, they're gonna find out who's funding this, and that's the decelerant, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2623.68s)]
*  that's the deterrence that finally these people are gonna see. This small group of agitators [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2628.48s)]
*  deployed to every single state that are pretending to be, you know, for the immigrants, but really [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2633.68s)]
*  they're just anti-anarchists. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWeVv8lHP8&t=2638.24s)]
