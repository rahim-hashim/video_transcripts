# Fox News Highlights - May 7th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM)
*  But first, brains versus bluster. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2.6s)]
*  Made a lot of news last night with Secretary Scott Besson, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=6.28s)]
*  and he, look, he doesn't need money. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  But given the aggressive stupidity he had to deal with [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=12.52s)]
*  for the past two days on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  the man deserves hardship pay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=18.48s)]
*  Mad Maxine Waters has been in Washington [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=21.56s)]
*  since what, the Paleozoic age, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=24.32s)]
*  but still doesn't understand that the federal government [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  actually hires these things called temporary employees, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=29.72s)]
*  such as we're hired at Musk's direction [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=34.44s)]
*  to find waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=37.24s)]
*  Did all the individuals working with Doge [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=40.36s)]
*  who were given access to treasuries [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=43.24s)]
*  and CFPB's computer databases [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=45.56s)]
*  receive all of the required clearances and security training [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  before they were granted access? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=52.28s)]
*  Again, they were granted read-only access at treasury. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=55.0s)]
*  There were two Doge employees. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=60.04s)]
*  So let me just say, please, you can't filibuster here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=63.48s)]
*  This is not the filibuster playground. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=64.84s)]
*  And so what you did was you let these strangers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=67.0s)]
*  into our treasury with access to all of the data, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=71.0s)]
*  all of the personnel information, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=74.68s)]
*  and you just opened the door. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=76.52s)]
*  Why'd you do that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=77.88s)]
*  No, ma'am, they were treasury employees. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=79.32s)]
*  No, despite his valiant effort, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=83.32s)]
*  Secretary Besson could not reason with Maxine no headroom. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Are you saying today in front of this committee [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=91.8s)]
*  that all of them were treasury employees, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  that the 25-year-old who's being identified, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=97.96s)]
*  who worked for Elon Musk was not allowed, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=101.16s)]
*  was allowed into the treasury? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=104.12s)]
*  Was that person there? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=106.12s)]
*  That was, he was a treasury employee, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  as was Tom Krause, the senior person on the Doge team. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=111.0s)]
*  There were only two people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=115.0s)]
*  There were Doge employees also. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=116.2s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=118.92s)]
*  Do you know, were you aware that there were Doge employees [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=119.24s)]
*  coming into our treasury, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=123.72s)]
*  getting all of our personal information? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=125.4s)]
*  Ma'am, there is no such thing as a Doge employee. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=127.64s)]
*  There were treasury employees. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=129.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=131.64s)]
*  I mean, circulation not getting to her head for some reason. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=132.6s)]
*  If this were a boxing match, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=136.36s)]
*  the ref would have called the fight after what, 60 seconds in? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=138.28s)]
*  But the parade of ignorance just kept rolling. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=142.04s)]
*  Tell us, tell the American people specifically, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=145.4s)]
*  which countries are you close to striking deals with? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=150.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, Congresswoman, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=155.16s)]
*  but that would not benefit the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=157.64s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm asking you a question [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=161.0s)]
*  based on the statement that you made on CNBC. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=163.4s)]
*  And I am telling you that it would be detrimental [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=168.52s)]
*  to the interest of the United States for me to answer that question. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=171.24s)]
*  Why would that be detrimental? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=174.44s)]
*  Because as the negotiations may still be in process as we speak, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  as we are not at the end of the week yet, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=183.88s)]
*  I am sure that you, through your question, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=186.36s)]
*  would not want to compromise the U.S. negotiations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=188.84s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=191.32s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  What on earth? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=194.76s)]
*  Is this really the best the Democrats can do? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  In congressional testimony yesterday, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=199.0s)]
*  you said the U.S. has not started negotiating with China on tariff reductions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=201.64s)]
*  Does that continue to be your position, yes or no? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=209.4s)]
*  As you may have read. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=213.0s)]
*  Yes or no, sir. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=213.8s)]
*  As you may have read in the press, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=214.84s)]
*  I will be going to Switzerland and the negotiations will begin on Saturday. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=216.44s)]
*  Okay, so the president told you that that would be your answer today. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=223.4s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=229.8s)]
*  Okay, what's really scary here is that her staff wrote her those questions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=231.16s)]
*  Your tax dollars at work, my friends. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=239.4s)]
*  Now, struggling to get their footing, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=241.88s)]
*  Democrats flail away in these hearings, happens all the time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=243.64s)]
*  And they're looking for their viral moments, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=247.0s)]
*  trying to find some line that will land, presumably, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  you think, with middle-class voters that they've alienated over the years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  And what better way to build bridges to the working class [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=256.76s)]
*  than to attack someone who worked his way to the American dream? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=260.36s)]
*  A number of my colleagues have brought it up about elite, the coastal elites. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=264.6s)]
*  Where did you go to school? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=269.24s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=270.6s)]
*  I grew up on Little River, South Carolina. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=271.48s)]
*  And what did you graduate? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=273.32s)]
*  500, 500. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=275.0s)]
*  You graduated from Yale. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=276.52s)]
*  You were part of the IOWF heads society. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=278.6s)]
*  Congressman, I worked three jobs to put myself in Yale. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=281.56s)]
*  I grew up just as poor as you did. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  You're a billionaire that went to Yale. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=287.72s)]
*  Of course, Congressman Vargas talked over Besant because he didn't want America to hear what [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  Besant was saying. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, he's a billionaire. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=298.04s)]
*  But he's one who put himself through Yale, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=299.56s)]
*  working multiple jobs, as he tried to say, as his friends were backpacking through Europe. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=302.36s)]
*  Again, Democrats are offering nothing new under the sun. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=307.8s)]
*  They tried the same nonsense, remember, with JD Vance during the campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=312.04s)]
*  How did that work out for them? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=316.36s)]
*  So it's crazy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=318.44s)]
*  Democrats are incapable, it seems, of changing tactics, of learning from failure. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=319.24s)]
*  They're weighed down by a deficit of discernment and a surplus of stupidity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=325.24s)]
*  Most of all, your testimony is always about the tax cuts and cutting costs [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=331.08s)]
*  and it's always about tax cuts and it's always about the rich. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=337.32s)]
*  But nothing is ever said about poor. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=341.64s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on social security, no tax on overtime. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=344.12s)]
*  Sure, I read your testimony. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=347.48s)]
*  That's not anywhere in here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=348.76s)]
*  The deductibility. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=350.12s)]
*  That is not in here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=351.08s)]
*  The deductibility of auto loans. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=351.88s)]
*  I am referring to your testimony and what I've listened to. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=352.84s)]
*  She's either a dullard or a liar. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=357.16s)]
*  If Trump doesn't care about the poor, if he's only for the rich, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=360.44s)]
*  how does she explain that Wall Street, the billionaire's playground, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=364.36s)]
*  is the group most furious with Trump about his tariffs? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=369.48s)]
*  And if the performance of Garcia, Vasquez, Vargas didn't impress you, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=375.16s)]
*  maybe the incisive questions of Greg Meeks will. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=379.64s)]
*  Who was the president in 2024? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=383.32s)]
*  One believes President Biden. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=390.28s)]
*  One believes? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=392.52s)]
*  You one of those non-believers that the election, the American people didn't vote? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=395.08s)]
*  I am not. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=402.36s)]
*  You're not? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  You said one believes? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=404.28s)]
*  Do you believe in the Constitution of the United States? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=408.2s)]
*  This should be a body bag. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=410.36s)]
*  I believe in the Constitution of the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=411.08s)]
*  So you believe in it without any second thought. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=413.64s)]
*  You don't have to think about it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=419.08s)]
*  You believe in it and you would abide by it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=420.76s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=423.4s)]
*  I have and I do, sir. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=424.36s)]
*  Okay. But do you know that a president has said he may or may not? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=425.8s)]
*  He don't know? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=430.92s)]
*  But then just when you thought that the hard left lost, well, the squad stepped up. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=435.4s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, do you know what a car seat is? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=443.0s)]
*  I have two children, yes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=448.76s)]
*  I figured as much. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=450.92s)]
*  It's correct you and your husband have two children. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=452.2s)]
*  The administration had already hinted that it's considering exempting baby products, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=456.28s)]
*  Congresswoman, from the tariffs, which shows the Trump administration's flexibility. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=461.0s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=465.32s)]
*  But Congressman Presley was there to grandstand [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=466.84s)]
*  and inadvertently made Trump's point that we're way too dependent on China for essential goods. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=470.2s)]
*  There have consistently been more than 3.5 million babies born in the United States. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  That means millions of families in this country are doing what? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=480.76s)]
*  Buying a car seat because it's essential and it is the law of the land. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=486.2s)]
*  Approximately nine out of every 10 car seats in the U.S. come from China. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=491.32s)]
*  Well, here we go. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=497.88s)]
*  The party that lives and breathes for abortion is finally standing up for the kids. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=499.64s)]
*  Okay, I'll take that as progress. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=506.12s)]
*  So today and yesterday, these Democrats, one after another, humiliated themselves. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  For four long years under Biden, the entire executive branch was focused [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=514.76s)]
*  not on raising your standard of living, not on our long-term financial viability, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  not on countering China, but on misplaced woke priorities. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=523.48s)]
*  They were asleep at the switch. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  Under the previous administration, we had three of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=530.52s)]
*  Two weeks before that, the Financial Stability Oversight Council published a report that said [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  that climate was the biggest threat to the financial system, not the deposit volatility, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  not over-leveraged bond portfolios. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  So we are promoting common sense back to basics. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=551.56s)]
*  Democrats went from being the party of the little guy in common sense to being the party [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=555.32s)]
*  of hedge funds, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=562.0400000000001s)]
*  And as President Trump and his team have spent the last few months developing a program, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=565.48s)]
*  it's very ambitious, to build a strong middle class that we all used to know growing up. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=569.48s)]
*  Liberals have nothing but old talking points from the 80s. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=575.6400000000001s)]
*  They have no plan B. They have no plan C. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=580.5200000000001s)]
*  Only plan F for failure. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=584.52s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=588.04s)]
*  Biden spent four years calling Trump a dictator and a threat to democracy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=589.96s)]
*  Now he's like, eh, I'd rather not comment. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=593.8s)]
*  Was the whole thing just a hoax? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=596.52s)]
*  It was, wasn't it? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  They were just telling Biden what to say and he was saying it? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=599.64s)]
*  Did he forget what he's been saying this whole time? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=602.92s)]
*  Or maybe he just doesn't want Trump shot again. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=606.04s)]
*  Good. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  Hopefully Joe tells the media because they're still saying Trump's Mussolini. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=609.88s)]
*  For as heartened as I am about the American people literally protesting every single day [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=614.6s)]
*  against what Trump and the Republicans are doing and so much more resistance than anybody told us [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=619.72s)]
*  to expect, I think it's also true that the people who warned us about how bad this was going to be, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  the people who were really hysterical, like really the doomsayers, they were all right [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  about how bad this is. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=634.6s)]
*  And what we're experiencing is not just somebody who's fighting against the Democratic party, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=635.8s)]
*  he's fighting against the democratic process. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=639.48s)]
*  And that's what you do when you don't ever want to have an election because you want to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=641.8s)]
*  stay in power for life. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  And that is what they are trying. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  All the worst predictions about what he'd be like are true. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=647.8s)]
*  Not as proud of the resistance, the Tesla terrorism or the singing and dancing? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=651.24s)]
*  Or the trips to El Salvador, which one? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  Or did she like those little signs that they held up at the State of the Union? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=659.16s)]
*  And what's she talking about Trump staying in power for life? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=663.0s)]
*  He just said JD and Marco would make amazing nominees. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=665.64s)]
*  He says he's not running again. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=668.68s)]
*  Democrats are supposed to have primary debates where Mato is supposed to moderate. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  Why waste her time if Trump's never leaving? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=675.48s)]
*  And she's basically saying she was right about Trump the whole time. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=678.36s)]
*  She's never been right. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=681.88s)]
*  She said Trump was arrest her. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=683.24s)]
*  She's still doing her show. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=685.64s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I'd like to see a little more retribution. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=688.12s)]
*  Democrats are still waiting to get arrested. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  They're actually begging for it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=694.76s)]
*  When can I, a former impeachment manager, expect the FBI at my door? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=696.52s)]
*  Ma'am, you want to know who was targeted by a weaponized FBI? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=703.64s)]
*  Me. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=706.76s)]
*  Should we worry more about your memory or your veracity? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=707.48s)]
*  We should worry more about your lack of candor. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=710.84s)]
*  You're accusing me of committing perjury. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=712.76s)]
*  Tell the American people how I broke the law and committed a felony. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=715.0s)]
*  Have the audacity to actually put the facts forward instead of lying for political banter [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  so you can have a 20 second donation hit. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=724.12s)]
*  Democrats want to be right so badly they're goading the FBI to incarcerate them. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=727.72s)]
*  They're like, please weaponize the FBI, please. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=732.84s)]
*  Their new gotcha question is, do you believe in the Constitution? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=736.6s)]
*  Who was the president in 2024? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=740.92s)]
*  One believes President Biden. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=747.88s)]
*  One believes? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=750.12s)]
*  Are you one of those non-believers that the election, the American people didn't vote? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=751.56s)]
*  Uh, I, um, I am not. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=757.16s)]
*  You're not? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=761.4s)]
*  You said one believes? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=761.96s)]
*  Do you believe in the Constitution of the United States? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=765.88s)]
*  I believe in the Constitution of the United States. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=768.04s)]
*  It's actually a trick question because was Biden really president in 2024? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=771.48s)]
*  Was it Susan Rice, Ron Klain, Jill, or the Auto Pen? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=775.8s)]

*  President Trump replied, that's what she said. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1345.94s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1355.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1367.14s)]
*  Which means we're back to looking for a few good men [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1370.8200000000002s)]

*  I don't get it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1445.5s)]
*  I do not get that joke. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  And finally, a bizarre video shows [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1449.82s)]
*  a bull casually mounting a scooter and riding it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1451.58s)]
*  Wow, would you look at that. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1455.94s)]
*  Joy Behar can ride a scooter. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1457.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1462.06s)]
*  Silly. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1463.94s)]
*  So protein is now pro-Trump. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1465.22s)]
*  A recent piece from Vanity Fair claims [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1467.7s)]
*  that a preference for protein is a tenant of the Manosphere, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1469.74s)]
*  that evil orbit of masculinity that counts Trump [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1473.1399999999999s)]
*  as their vile leader. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1476.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, podcasters who love Trump promote protein. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1478.6599999999999s)]
*  So it must be bad. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1481.46s)]
*  Testosterone is evil too, unless it's [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1483.06s)]
*  being pumped into a pre-teen girl. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1485.26s)]
*  Hell, I bet they even think running as an act is political. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1487.94s)]
*  Running as an act is political. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1493.8600000000001s)]
*  And you know who taught me that? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1496.42s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1498.1000000000001s)]
*  The first thing he told me was that running is a privilege [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1499.14s)]
*  and being a part of the running community [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1501.78s)]
*  is a privilege that not all people have access to. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1503.3400000000001s)]
*  Mm. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1507.9s)]
*  That was Hope Walz, Tim's daughter, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1509.9s)]
*  attacking a running influencer for visiting the White House. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1513.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes, running is a privilege, which I hope she [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1517.26s)]
*  forgets when fleeing a mugger. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1519.7s)]
*  But it's no wonder so many young men are running from the Dems [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1523.22s)]
*  when this guy was your face of masculinity. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1526.1s)]
*  But the left's quest against the Manosphere isn't new. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1529.62s)]
*  They attacked Rogan for hosting Trump, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1532.18s)]
*  pinned the UFC as a sanctuary for MAGA culture, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1534.7s)]
*  and all because the left hates Trump. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1538.18s)]
*  And why? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1540.22s)]
*  Well, he works hard, doing more before 9 AM [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1541.14s)]
*  than the Dems do all year. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1543.86s)]
*  He secured the border, restored our military, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1545.5s)]
*  and did radical gender ideology. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1547.74s)]
*  Suddenly, the military is recruiting more young men [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1549.98s)]
*  than a twister tournament at Don Lemon's beach house. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1553.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1555.94s)]
*  Hey. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1559.94s)]
*  Hey. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1561.94s)]
*  But for some reason, the left ties discipline, hard work, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1562.94s)]
*  and accountability to Trump, which [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1570.62s)]
*  means by process of elimination, they [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1573.1s)]
*  want you to be fat, lazy, and stupid. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1575.54s)]
*  I believe the medical term is rosy. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1578.98s)]
*  But aspirational goals for good health [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1587.2199999999998s)]
*  are one of many aspirations the left now see as evil. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1589.62s)]
*  Remember when Time magazine declared exercise [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1593.3s)]
*  as racist and rooted in whiteness? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1595.82s)]
*  And remember that math was racist, too? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1598.98s)]
*  Scientific American wrote a whole article [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1601.54s)]
*  about its white patriarchal past. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1603.46s)]
*  They should have just said math is sexist [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1606.34s)]
*  because women can't do it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1608.74s)]
*  A sexist would say. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1610.5s)]
*  Duke Medical School once said that showing up on time [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1613.86s)]
*  reflects white supremacy culture. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1616.74s)]
*  Yeah, because when having lifesaving emergency surgery, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1619.1399999999999s)]
*  it's always good for the head surgeon to be fashionably late. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1621.8999999999999s)]
*  Of course, even the aspirational American lawn [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1625.58s)]
*  is rooted in colonialism and racism. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1628.86s)]
*  So it's no surprise that the people who [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1631.6599999999999s)]
*  said reading to your child disadvantages others [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1633.54s)]
*  are now coming for your hamburger. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1637.5s)]
*  That's enough to make Chris Christie become a Republican. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1639.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1642.62s)]
*  So the left links these healthy behaviors [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1645.9799999999998s)]
*  to MAGA, which forces them to take [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1647.9799999999998s)]
*  the side of the opposite, unhealthy crap. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1650.28s)]
*  True, even Jedis must now be fat. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1653.06s)]
*  Remember the woke body positivity movement? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1659.62s)]
*  Yeah, some picture of health. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1662.58s)]
*  All it does is make airplanes use more fuel. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1664.4599999999998s)]
*  So it's a hell of a list. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1668.06s)]
*  Leading a healthy life is racist. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1669.3799999999999s)]
*  Improving your intelligence is bigoted. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1670.9399999999998s)]
*  Competing against your own gender is transphobic. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1672.8999999999999s)]
*  Never mind that if you're black, gay, or poor, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1675.4599999999998s)]
*  and you do these things, you'll be more successful [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1677.58s)]
*  than if you didn't. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1679.74s)]
*  It's about doing the work, something Dems avoid. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1681.1s)]
*  For them, everything is supposed to be easy. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1684.06s)]
*  You're a victim. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1686.26s)]
*  That is beautiful. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1687.18s)]
*  And it's someone else's fault. You're an idiot. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  No wonder these are your spokespersons. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1690.9s)]
*  The laziness is both political and personal. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1694.22s)]
*  Don't send illegals back. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1697.1000000000001s)]

*  It's no surprise that people who don't believe in work [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1703.22s)]
*  also don't believe in shaving their armpits. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1705.54s)]
*  I know. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1708.98s)]
*  Took forever to get that picture. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1711.5800000000002s)]
*  It's funny, the Dems love to wax poetic about doing the work. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1713.94s)]
*  Yet all they do is burn down a building, lie on a highway, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1717.1s)]
*  or pour soup on a painting. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1719.82s)]
*  The real work was in creating all those things, which [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1721.62s)]
*  was done by people who didn't spend their time blaming [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1724.3799999999999s)]
*  others' success and making excuses for their own failures. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1726.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, the people who do that work [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1730.26s)]
*  are mocked for sticking to their traditions of discipline [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1731.86s)]
*  and delayed gratification. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1734.58s)]
*  There's no one the left hates more than someone who paid back [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1736.3s)]
*  their student loans. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1739.2199999999998s)]
*  It's the politics of resentment and blame. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1740.82s)]
*  But they also oppose fitness to justify their own lack thereof. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1743.34s)]
*  Which is why they have no desire to do the heavy lifting. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1747.1s)]
*  Literally. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1750.06s)]
*  Let's hear it! [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1750.82s)]
*  Here he is! [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1752.82s)]
*  Tonight's guest. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1754.82s)]
*  He's so hot, you need an oven mitt to grab his ass. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1757.82s)]
*  Chef and restaurant owner Andrew Gruel. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1761.82s)]
*  Look deep into his soul and you'll find a devious troll. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1763.82s)]
*  Host of the You're Welcome podcast, Michael Mallet. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1769.82s)]
*  She loves BAM! [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1772.82s)]
*  Fans that wear flannel. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1777.54s)]
*  And being on our panel, host of the Kennedy Safety World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1778.54s)]
*  And just like Mount Everest, there's a three-year wait just to climb him. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1785.54s)]
*  New York Times bestseller, the author, comedian, and former MWA. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1790.54s)]
*  Andrew, you own and operate some restaurants. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1798.54s)]
*  Do you notice that it's only MAGA people who eat protein? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1801.54s)]
*  Yeah, well apparently I'm a purveyor of hate. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1805.26s)]
*  According to the left. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1807.26s)]
*  Actually there is a silver lining to this. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1809.26s)]
*  Because when I see these headlines, I get mad. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1811.26s)]
*  I do. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1813.26s)]
*  I get a little worked up. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1814.26s)]
*  I got to take a breather, have some worm toast and a quinoa bowl. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1815.26s)]
*  Just to bring my protein level down so I can be calm and lucid. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1817.26s)]
*  But there are really, in the grand scheme of things, no successful vegan or vegetarian restaurants. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1821.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple outliers. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1826.26s)]
*  But you're not driving down the street being like should we have McDonald's vegan, McDonald's vegan. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1827.26s)]
*  I mean it's like McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1831.26s)]
*  So I understand that really this is just about them trying to create something out of nothing. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1833.98s)]
*  It's just like pseudo-intellectual drive to create an issue out of absolutely nothing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1836.98s)]
*  It also goes to show you how quick our news cycle is. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1840.98s)]
*  Because protein's been in for like a hundred years. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1842.98s)]
*  Like this isn't anything new. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1844.98s)]
*  Just because the liver king was out there eating lamb hearts. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1846.98s)]
*  That's not that big of a deal. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1849.98s)]
*  There's one story on the outside. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1851.98s)]
*  But what this comes down to, and I'm going to get big here, I'm going to get grand, okay. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1853.98s)]
*  Is that the right or those people who think pragmatically and reasonably, not just the right, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1857.98s)]
*  but the right and the left. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1863.7s)]
*  We're the only in the center libertarians, right? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1864.7s)]
*  We build things up, right? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1866.7s)]
*  We create things, the left tears it down. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1867.7s)]
*  So it's as grand as cities and architecture, but also ourselves. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1869.7s)]
*  We want to be able to live without medicine. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1872.7s)]
*  We want to be able to sleep well. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1874.7s)]
*  We want to be able to feel good, comfortable, not take antidepressants. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1875.7s)]
*  The left absolutely hates that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1878.7s)]
*  They want to tear that down. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1880.7s)]
*  So really it comes back down to that kind of fundamental rubric towards how they think [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1881.7s)]
*  about operating the world. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1887.7s)]
*  And they want us to be weak and fat and Rosie O'Donnell so that then they can control us. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1888.7s)]
*  So I don't always want to overly indulge in the conspiracy theories, but really that's [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1893.42s)]
*  what it comes down to. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1896.42s)]
*  Oh, well interesting. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1897.42s)]
*  He said a mouthful, Michael. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1900.42s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1905.42s)]
*  Why is doing good or doing better, being aspirational, now a MAGA thing? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1907.42s)]
*  Well I think it's always been correlated very heavily with being on the right. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1912.42s)]
*  Because if the idea is if you have responsibility to change yourself, to improve your station, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1915.42s)]
*  if it's something you have control over, those people do tend to vote Republican as opposed [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1921.14s)]
*  to it's society's fault, it's racism, it's sexism, and so forth. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1925.14s)]
*  I think this is a really great thing because the gym is something where anyone can improve [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1928.14s)]
*  day to day. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1933.14s)]
*  And when you have those quantifiable results, it helps with your self-esteem, it helps with [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1934.14s)]
*  everything else. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1938.14s)]
*  And at a certain point it becomes why do I need this nanny government or this politician [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1939.14s)]
*  to help me out when I have what it takes maybe not to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, but certainly [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1943.14s)]
*  a better version of myself. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1947.14s)]
*  So I think this is a great trend. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1948.14s)]
*  It's great for people's health, it's great for their self-esteem, it's great for size [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  as a whole, and it's great for people to kind of be better children. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1952.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, you know it's true. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1956.8600000000001s)]
*  I go to the gym when I was benching twice my body weight. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1957.8600000000001s)]
*  I do too. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1960.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1961.8600000000001s)]
*  You did 200? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1962.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, I did 200. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1963.8600000000001s)]
*  Wow, almost two plates! [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1964.8600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1965.8600000000001s)]
*  Almost two plates? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1966.8600000000001s)]
*  That's no joke! [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1967.8600000000001s)]
*  But you know what it is? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1968.8600000000001s)]
*  You lift something up, you put it back down, you build muscle. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1969.8600000000001s)]
*  It's cause and effect. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1972.8600000000001s)]
*  It's incentives. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1973.8600000000001s)]
*  It's the most consistent. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1974.8600000000001s)]
*  It's the most effective. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1975.8600000000001s)]
*  It's cause and effect. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1977.58s)]
*  It's incentives. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1978.58s)]
*  It's the most conservative thing in the world, Kennedy. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1979.58s)]
*  You exercise. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1982.02s)]
*  You run, don't you? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1983.02s)]
*  I do. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1984.02s)]
*  Do you think you're running as a political act? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1985.02s)]
*  No, and it's really funny because I was watching that and it made me realize that Tim Wall's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1986.86s)]
*  daughter, she made this big stink about like, I'm not going to grad school now because, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1991.86s)]
*  and I don't know what the stupid reason was, but you know she was grandstanding. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=1998.86s)]
*  She was like, I'm turning, she was never accepted because she's so dumb. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she's stupid. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2005.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like, if you go to sub-Saharan Africa where they produce the best runners [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2006.14s)]
*  in the world, they're not people of privilege. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2010.66s)]
*  It's not Kenyans and Ethiopians living in gilded ivory towers who are flown in helicopters [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2014.9s)]
*  to their private tracks and with their nutritionists. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2021.74s)]
*  It's people who do the simplest thing on the planet. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2026.26s)]
*  And oftentimes they can't afford footwear, so that's where barefoot running came from. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2029.5800000000002s)]
*  And literally doing what human beings are designed to do and doing it well without any [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2035.3799999999999s)]
*  iota of privilege, that doesn't occur to them. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2040.3s)]
*  What occurs to them is maybe if I'm faster than everyone else, then I can go compete [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2043.62s)]
*  on the global stage and make money and take care of my family and build a hospital in [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2048.26s)]
*  my village. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2053.54s)]
*  She's so ass-backwards. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2054.98s)]
*  It's not like lacrosse or downhill skiing that require tons of equipment and you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2056.46s)]
*  you have to have membership to a country club. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2063.34s)]
*  Running is the most beautifully basic thing in the world, even more basic than that pumpkin [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2065.94s)]
*  spice bitch who was speaking on behalf of her mediocre family, Tim Walz. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2070.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's so obvious. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2077.42s)]
*  Like, you don't need to do like a 23 and me test. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2082.42s)]
*  That's definitely his kid. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrhv_OYoFM&t=2087.9s)]
