# Fox News Highlights - July 10th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08)
*  But first, how to train a radical. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's Angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=2.88s)]
*  Now, as the Angle predicted a few weeks ago, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=7.32s)]
*  heavy hitters on Wall Street are panicking, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=9.28s)]
*  not about the economy, about the rise of Zoran Mondani. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The current favorite to become New York's next mayor, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=16.3s)]
*  will they believe, lay waste to the city's capitalist spirit [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  by pushing government price controls [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=22.66s)]
*  and heavy-handed regulations at all levels. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=24.68s)]
*  A new independent expenditure group named [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=27.12s)]
*  New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=30.14s)]
*  is launching a campaign against Mondani [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=32.7s)]
*  with a plan to raise around $20 million. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=35.42s)]
*  Well, they see him in his rise as a tsunami warning, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=39.56s)]
*  with capitalism, of course, on the line. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=43.34s)]
*  And they're right to be worried. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=45.78s)]
*  Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=47.3s)]
*  says that the Democrats have gone off the rails [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=49.38s)]
*  with DEI and other radical policies, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=52.3s)]
*  and that Mondani is more Marxist than a socialist, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=55.1s)]
*  and said the campaign's talking points [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=58.7s)]
*  were the same ideological mush [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=60.78s)]
*  that means nothing in the real world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  But the ideological mush is at work across the country, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=66.28s)]
*  and it's meanin' something, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=69.9s)]
*  in colleges and universities, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  at anti-ICE and pro-Hamas protests, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=73.42s)]
*  and in violent attacks now on law enforcement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=76.06s)]
*  And the goal, by the way, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=80.08s)]
*  it's not winning an election here, an election there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=80.92s)]
*  The goal is the total dismantlement [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=83.98s)]
*  of the United States government, our institutions, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=86.34s)]
*  and of course our trust in officials at every level. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=89.22s)]
*  Now, the behavior here, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=92.26s)]
*  it's very important everyone understand this tonight, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=93.62s)]
*  is learned. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=95.66s)]
*  Their warped thinking has been taught, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  and those teaching it are organizing at events [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=100.06s)]
*  such as Socialism 2025, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  the big conference that took place [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=105.26s)]
*  over the 4th of July weekend in Chicago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Now, the propagandists are working 24-7, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  and they include professors attending this conference, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  such as Lorgia Garcia-Pena from Princeton. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=115.02s)]
*  Capitalism sucks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=119.3s)]
*  It thrives on individualism, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=121.58s)]
*  and individualism is killing us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=123.34s)]
*  Says the most narcissistic [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  and self-absorbed people on the planet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=130.1s)]
*  Individualism is the problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=133.04s)]
*  Now, such as a lecturer at UPenn named Geo Maher, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=135.22s)]
*  who is still waiting, apparently, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=140.38s)]
*  for the post-war, Civil War reconstruction. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=141.78s)]
*  We live in a moment that is characterized fundamentally [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=145.38s)]
*  by the defeat of that reconstruction project, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=148.26s)]
*  and until this reconstruction is completed, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=150.7s)]
*  until the sort of new, the Neo-Confederates [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=153.22s)]
*  that we see sticking their heads out of their snake holes [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=156.12s)]
*  all over the country are decapitated, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=158.4s)]
*  we will not have a truly different [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=160.7s)]
*  and a truly democratic country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=162.34s)]
*  Nice t-shirt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=164.06s)]
*  Decapitation, is that what he said? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=165.22s)]
*  Well, next time he should travel with a guillotine [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=167.5s)]
*  and really drive that point home. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=169.82s)]
*  Now, the goal for these malcontents is simple. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=172.18s)]
*  To convince a critical mass of Americans, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  especially young people, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=177.26s)]
*  that our country isn't worth fighting for. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=179.14s)]
*  It's not, certainly not worth celebrating or saving. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=181.66s)]
*  And if you wonder why Chicago public schools [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=184.94s)]
*  remain among the worst in the nation, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  look no further than Stacey Davis Gates, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=189.18s)]
*  a Teacher's Union president. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  Like, yo, people going to the beach tomorrow, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=194.62s)]
*  they celebrating and fireworks, ain't no damn America. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=197.98s)]
*  The re-imagination of this place [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=201.46s)]
*  that we are trying to save, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=203.62s)]
*  but kind of not because we ain't out here saving it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=205.46s)]
*  Like we doing stuff, like shout out to CTU. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=209.38s)]
*  You build a militancy in a coalition [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=212.74s)]
*  where if it has to go down, it goes down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=216.7s)]
*  You call the strike. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=221.02s)]
*  Notice the lingo here, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=223.34s)]
*  focused on teacher strikes and so forth, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=224.78s)]
*  building a militancy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=227.28s)]
*  Forget making sure kids learn about something [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  that might be useful to become independent adults. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=232.12s)]
*  Let's focus on getting teachers on the picket line [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  so they can strike and actually not teach anything. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=237.44s)]
*  Might be better. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=240.0s)]
*  Now the socialism agenda is really anti-American activism, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  which includes constant recruitment of new activists [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=245.84s)]
*  from young children to college students to colleagues. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=249.0s)]
*  I'm an engineering professor. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=253.12s)]
*  I don't know how to wrestle with doing community building [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=254.48s)]
*  in a way that doesn't get exploited by the university. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=259.32s)]
*  Get the university's money to do the work you want to do [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=263.32s)]
*  to dismantle the university within. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=266.28s)]
*  I think that is what I would advise what I try to do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=268.52s)]
*  And hopefully I won't end up in court [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=273.04s)]
*  for saying this on a mic. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=275.4s)]
*  End up in court, she's going to get a raise from Princeton, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=277.28s)]
*  dismantle the university from within. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=279.68s)]
*  Yeah, they knew what they were getting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=282.56s)]
*  when they hired her, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=284.64s)]
*  That's why they hired her. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=286.72s)]
*  That's a large part of her appeal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=288.48s)]
*  Her deep seated hatred of the system [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=290.64s)]
*  made her cool and edgy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=293.9s)]
*  She fit right into the club of campus radicals [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=296.4s)]
*  who are rarely held accountable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you're not judged on the merit of your performance [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=301.46s)]
*  or the soundness of your thinking, your scholarship, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=304.72s)]
*  you traffic in meaningless cliches and generalities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=307.22s)]
*  We don't live in a democracy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=311.04s)]
*  We just start saying that more so. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=312.64s)]
*  I mean, there's so many different ways. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=314.32s)]
*  I'm not going to go into it, but people are clapping. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=315.44s)]
*  So there's general agreement. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=317.28s)]
*  I'm glad we agree on that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=318.8s)]
*  So do we capture the state [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=320.84s)]
*  or do we try to replace it with something different? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=322.96s)]
*  And I think it's the latter, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=325.84s)]
*  which is to replace it with something different. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=327.08s)]
*  And this is what today's Democrats believe, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=329.84s)]
*  Mamdani, AOC, Jayapal, Omar, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=332.18s)]
*  that America's traditional institutions, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=335.68s)]

*  the standards of excellence, merit, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=419.16s)]

*  and the Constitution. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=754.88s)]
*  Yep, he pled the Fifth to all questions [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=755.88s)]
*  claiming doctor-patient privilege, which I get. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=758.88s)]
*  It's the only thing stopping my doctor [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=760.88s)]
*  from telling the world about my birthmark [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=762.88s)]
*  that looks like Brit Hume. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=764.88s)]
*  Now, obviously, the doctor's protecting himself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=768.88s)]
*  Being Biden's physician is a tough gig. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=771.88s)]
*  Every day, it's something. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=774.88s)]
*  He shattered his kneecap, checking his reflexes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=776.88s)]
*  He's got wet bones and sweaty teeth. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=779.88s)]
*  It's like being a veterinarian. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=781.88s)]
*  One day, you're popping back in his shoulder. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=783.88s)]
*  Then you're removing worms from the burrow in his leg. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=785.88s)]
*  Finally, you're pulling a chipmunk out of his butt. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=788.88s)]
*  It's like being the groundskeeper for a golf course. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=793.88s)]
*  There's 18 holes you need to take care of. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=796.88s)]
*  But the doctor wasn't alone in his defense of old liver spots. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=801.88s)]
*  He got help from a stupid person from Texas. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=805.88s)]
*  So, do you have the right to confidentiality? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=807.88s)]
*  You have the right to confidentiality [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=810.88s)]
*  when it comes to your health care. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=813.88s)]
*  It's kind of astounding to hear someone say, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=815.88s)]
*  if you invoke the Fifth Amendment, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=817.88s)]
*  that is only because you are guilty. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=819.88s)]
*  The country is off the rails right now. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=821.88s)]
*  People have concerns about the current occupant [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=823.88s)]
*  in the White House and whether or not [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=826.88s)]
*  he is mentally fit to serve in this moment. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=828.88s)]
*  Now, this moron is not completely wrong. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=832.88s)]
*  Normal people do have the right to medical privacy, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=835.88s)]
*  but they also have a right not to be lied to. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=838.88s)]
*  You know, that the person in charge of the nuclear codes [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=841.88s)]
*  doesn't have a brain more shattered [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=844.88s)]
*  than a chair on the view. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=846.88s)]
*  And she shouldn't be talking about mental fitness [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=849.88s)]
*  when her brain hasn't hit the gym in years. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=851.88s)]
*  Every time I hear her talk, I ask myself, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=854.88s)]
*  hey, I wonder if Lenny from Mice and Men [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=856.88s)]
*  finds her as stupid as we do. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=858.88s)]
*  But did you see Joe Biden every single day? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=860.88s)]
*  I didn't see Joe Biden every single day, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=863.88s)]
*  but I did have an opportunity [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=865.88s)]
*  to interact with the president. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=867.88s)]
*  I never had a concern. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=869.88s)]
*  We know that this is someone that was born with a stutter [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=871.88s)]
*  that ultimately had to get over it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=874.88s)]
*  Bored with a stutter? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=876.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=877.88s)]
*  I remember when I had a stutter, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=878.88s)]
*  it was so bad, it caused me to wander into the rainforest. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=880.88s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=883.88s)]
*  Ah, it gets worse. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=884.88s)]
*  So Joe only had a stutter. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=886.88s)]
*  Yeah, and Stephen Hawking's feet were just asleep. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=889.88s)]
*  But to this day, Dems pretend his decline was shocking. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=901.88s)]
*  But he's not the only one who's had a stutter. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=904.88s)]
*  He's had a stutter. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=907.88s)]
*  But to this day, Dems pretend his decline was shocking, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=909.88s)]
*  something they're just learning about now, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=912.88s)]
*  which is like just finding out that John Travolta is gay, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=915.88s)]
*  named Wait. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=918.88s)]
*  Former CNN analyst Chris Saliza [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=922.88s)]
*  is still shocked Joe couldn't be trusted [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=924.88s)]
*  outside of a non-staged event. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=926.88s)]
*  This dope's eternally surprised by stuff, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=929.88s)]
*  including basic info everyone who isn't Chris Saliza [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=931.88s)]
*  already knew. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=935.88s)]
*  Remember, in 2021, this guy claimed Republicans [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=936.88s)]
*  were trying to make Biden's mental capacity an issue. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=939.88s)]
*  But now, with Biden gone, the truth is safe to tell. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=942.88s)]
*  Like when the statute of limitations expires [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=946.88s)]
*  and Steve Doocy can finally admit he's the Zodiac Killer. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=949.88s)]
*  Look, we don't want this doctor in jail. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=956.88s)]
*  I mean, look at the poor guy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=960.88s)]
*  30 minutes in Rikers and he passed around [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=962.88s)]
*  like P. Diddy's girlfriend at a freak-off. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=964.88s)]
*  All we want is the real story. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=968.88s)]
*  Like how could the diagnosis of Biden's prostate cancer [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=970.88s)]
*  go unnoticed for so long? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=973.88s)]
*  What, did Joe's butthole have its own secret service? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=975.88s)]
*  Why did a Parkinson's expert visit the White House [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=978.88s)]
*  eight times in eight months? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=981.88s)]
*  That's once a month, far more often than I floss. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=982.88s)]
*  But maybe there's a solution. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=988.88s)]
*  If you give the doc immunity, he could spill the beans [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=989.88s)]
*  without incriminating himself. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=991.88s)]
*  And while you're at it, pardon the doctor [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=993.88s)]
*  for that terrible haircut. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=995.88s)]
*  Trump would do it if I asked him. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=997.88s)]
*  After all, that's how I got Geraldo on the no-fly list. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=999.88s)]
*  But let's be honest, O'Connor, the doctor, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1006.88s)]
*  was just taking orders. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1008.88s)]
*  And not from Joe, but from people around him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1009.88s)]
*  And I want those scalps. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1012.88s)]
*  I want them to be scorned like my assistants [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1014.88s)]
*  when they don't pick up the clippings after shaving my back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1016.88s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1023.88s)]
*  God help your soul if you piss off this troll. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1026.88s)]
*  Author of Not Sick of Winning, Michael Malis. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1031.88s)]
*  She's been on Fox News longer than Super Beats. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1038.88s)]
*  Fox News anchor, Julie Banderas. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1041.88s)]
*  At his restaurant, the dessert menu is a picture of his ass. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1048.88s)]
*  Chef and restaurant owner, Andrew Gruhl. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1051.88s)]
*  And when this libertarian reads [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1057.88s)]
*  The Three Little Pigs to her son, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1059.88s)]
*  she replaces the wolf with the IRS. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1061.88s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1063.88s)]
*  Fox News contributor, Kat Jep. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1064.88s)]
*  Michael, great to see you, as always. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1070.88s)]
*  I wish I could say the same. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1073.88s)]
*  Are you surprised the doctor pled the fifth? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1077.88s)]
*  Maybe this is my anarchist hat talking, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1079.88s)]
*  but there's no reason to ever talk to the authorities [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1081.88s)]
*  if you can get away with it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1083.88s)]
*  If the cops stop you, you can talk your way into an arrest [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1085.88s)]
*  and not out of one. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1087.88s)]
*  So if I'm facing that firing squad, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1089.88s)]
*  which is the House or the Senate, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1091.88s)]
*  I'd sure keep my damn mouth shut, and why wouldn't I? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1093.88s)]
*  And I also would remind people of Trump's doctor, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1095.88s)]
*  Ronnie Jackson, because when he opened his mouth, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1097.88s)]
*  his office got raided by Trump's guys, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1100.88s)]
*  and he died not that long after. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1103.88s)]
*  So he's doing a smart thing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1105.88s)]
*  He knows he was covering things up. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1107.88s)]
*  But if you're the president's doctor, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1109.88s)]
*  that's your job to keep your mouth shut. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1110.88s)]
*  You shouldn't be spilling those beans. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1112.88s)]
*  Supposed to keep your mouth shut [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1113.88s)]
*  and supply him with the best drugs. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1114.88s)]
*  And also, I don't think if Biden was cogent, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1116.88s)]
*  his administration would be run all that differently. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1118.88s)]
*  That's true! [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1120.88s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1121.88s)]
*  I don't get it that that's such a huge scandal. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1122.88s)]
*  You know it's the deep state running it all anyway. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1124.88s)]
*  Mm-hmm, that is true. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1126.88s)]
*  It's like to think that a normal-brained Biden [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1128.88s)]
*  would be any more effective is kind of foolish. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1130.88s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1133.88s)]
*  What about the media, Julie? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1134.88s)]
*  That's part of the media. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1136.88s)]
*  What say you? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1138.88s)]
*  Isn't it really about, like, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1139.88s)]
*  we can expect the Democrats to play cover-up and lie, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1140.88s)]
*  but the media is supposed to uncover the cover-ups. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1144.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1147.88s)]
*  Well, the media is supposed to be asking the tough questions, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1148.88s)]
*  but the media doesn't ask tough questions, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1150.88s)]
*  although one of our reporters at Fox did try to talk to him [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1151.88s)]
*  and ask him a question, and of course, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1154.88s)]
*  he refused to answer the same he didn't in Congress. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1156.88s)]
*  I think if he's going to invoke the Fifth Amendment, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1158.88s)]
*  the question presented to him by Congress [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1160.88s)]
*  should be like, who's your barber? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1162.88s)]
*  That would be a great way to save somebody's career. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1164.88s)]
*  He looks like Dumb and Dumber. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1166.88s)]
*  Blunt bangs don't work. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1167.88s)]
*  But I do want to say this. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1171.88s)]
*  Regarding the Fifth Amendment, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1173.88s)]
*  and I understand the patient-doctor confidentiality agreement, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1174.88s)]
*  I do understand that, but the question was not, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1177.88s)]
*  did he have a hemorrhoid or did he have Parkinson's [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1179.88s)]
*  or did he have cancer? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1183.88s)]
*  The question was simply, did you lie for the president? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1184.88s)]
*  And that is a question that his lawyers advised him not to answer, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1186.88s)]
*  so we all know the answer. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1189.88s)]
*  He lied. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1191.88s)]
*  He lied for the president, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1192.88s)]
*  as well as the entire administration lied for the president. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1193.88s)]
*  You know, good point, Julie. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1195.88s)]
*  Wow. Really? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1198.88s)]
*  Andrew, you know, the thing is, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1201.88s)]
*  I do feel that the media is getting away with this. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1202.88s)]
*  This is a cover-up that makes, you know, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1206.88s)]
*  Watergate look like a parking ticket. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1208.88s)]
*  I've said it before. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1210.88s)]
*  But how can you have the media investigate the media? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1211.88s)]
*  That's like giving your own prostate exam. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1215.88s)]
*  You've got to be really limber to do that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1217.88s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1219.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good call. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1220.88s)]
*  You know, I sued myself once. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1221.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, made out pretty good. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1222.88s)]
*  It's the same idea. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1224.88s)]
*  This is a scandal wrapped in a scandal, layers and layers. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1226.88s)]
*  It's like the turducting of scandals. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1229.88s)]
*  But the funniest thing, you're right, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1230.88s)]
*  is not just the fact that the media is trying to cover it up, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1232.88s)]
*  but that they're also placing themselves as the heroes in this story, right? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1235.88s)]
*  Jake Tapper is like, look at all of this stuff that happened. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1238.88s)]
*  Everyone's like, wow, you are so clear and concise on recognizing that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1240.88s)]
*  The entire country knew that Biden was not running the show, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1245.88s)]
*  and the fact that we're still playing the game, that he's OK, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1249.88s)]
*  and we're using the stutter, it's the stutter fly effect, right? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1252.88s)]
*  It's like the butterfly effect. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1255.88s)]
*  It's that a simple stutter can lead to record breaking consumer price [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1256.88s)]
*  index increases, inflation, a crashing economy. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1260.88s)]
*  My stutter's done so much for it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1264.88s)]
*  You guys probably don't hear it, but I'm repeating everything I'm saying. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1265.88s)]
*  It's in different words. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1269.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1271.88s)]
*  There's a joke in there. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1272.88s)]
*  I just can't think of it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1273.88s)]
*  You know, Kat, Kat, would it be your worst nightmare [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1274.88s)]
*  for your doctor to appear in some kind of hearing and be asked questions? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1278.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1283.88s)]
*  No. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1284.88s)]
*  I feel like I'm pretty open. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1286.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1289.88s)]
*  I feel like the most upset person in all of this should be Kamala, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1291.88s)]
*  if she was aware enough, because think about the huge lengths [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1296.88s)]
*  that the government, the media went so far to make sure [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1301.88s)]
*  that he was so far to do everything they could to cover this up, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1307.88s)]
*  that he was severely cognitively impaired because as bad as it was, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1311.88s)]
*  they thought that he would still do better than she would. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ywW2R8H08&t=1316.88s)]
