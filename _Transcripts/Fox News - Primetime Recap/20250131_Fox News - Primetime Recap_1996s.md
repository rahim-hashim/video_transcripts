# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 30, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo)
*  These are crushing losses for families across the country and all the way to Russia. And all of us want to know how this could have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=0.0s)]
*  happened. Sixty seven Americans dead and others born in other countries. But it's one of the busiest airports in the country. I [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=6.88s)]
*  fly out of it all the time. Everyone around here does. It's just a few miles from the White House and the Capitol. So again is it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=14.88s)]
*  really necessary for military aircraft to conduct nighttime practice runs so close to a busy commercial flight path to the lay [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=22.2s)]
*  person that seems I don't really. I'm sorry but it sounds stupid. And of course the obvious questions like why didn't the Blackhawk [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=31.28s)]
*  pilot heed the flight warning. But then the other question did he even receive it or was it even transmitted to him or did it come [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=38.92s)]
*  on another channel. And then what was the staffing like in the tower. Were there enough eyes on the skies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=47.24s)]
*  But there is disturbing new information out tonight that may shed light on the situation. The New York Times was first to report [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=54.84s)]
*  that the staffing at Reagan during that time of night in the tower was quote not normal. An internal FAA report is revealing many [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  unsettling facts but perhaps this is the most disturbing. The controller who was handling helicopters and the airport's vicinity Wednesday [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=69.84s)]
*  night was also instructing planes that were landing and departing from its runways. Those jobs are typically assigned to two [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=78.56s)]
*  controllers rather than one. So let that sink in for a minute. Should we assume that since the controller shortage exists coast to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=86.76s)]
*  coast all across the country there's controller shortages in the towers that these controllers nationwide are now doing double duty [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=96.36s)]
*  under extreme pressure with thousands of lives on the line every day. More from the report this increases the workload for the air [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=104.52s)]
*  traffic controller and can complicate the job. One reason is that the controllers can use different radio frequencies to communicate with [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=113.4s)]
*  pilots flying planes and pilots flying helicopters. While the controller is communicating with pilots of the helicopter and the jet the two [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=121.16s)]
*  sets of pilots may not be able to hear one another. OK. This is insane. The staffing in the tower at Reagan National last night was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=130.44s)]
*  nearly a third below targeted staff levels. We read again until they find and analyze all the black boxes. We won't know what caused this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=141.36s)]
*  crash. But it's also worth remembering that along with the staffing problem problems are the upticks in the number of close calls on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=152.36s)]
*  runways and near midair collisions. Just a few weeks ago we had one and this has spurred warnings from aviation experts that would only be a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  matter of time before tragedy struck. We've got current and former air traffic controllers telling the New York Times that close calls [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=169.4s)]
*  were happening so frequently. They're really scared. It's only a matter of time until it until a deadly crash occurs. We don't want to scare [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  people out there. We just want to let them know that this is what's going on behind the scenes. Clearly this is a job where there is no room [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=186.4s)]
*  for error. And even if we have the best of the best in place which we should we can't expect them to handle double the workload. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=193.2s)]
*  Now the new Trump administration is committed to fixing this mess which requires getting the FAA back to a singular focus which is its [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=202.64s)]
*  primary mission to keep our skies safe not to keep the workplace diverse. I went into a meeting and I was the junior most junior person [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=209.6s)]
*  there and I looked around the table and it was full of women. And that's when I really realized this is an agency that can empower women [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=220.8s)]
*  and grow them and make them and have them become leaders. All that all that nonsense. Diversity that has to go. It is back to common [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=228.56s)]
*  sense. These air traffic controllers should be hired and paid extremely well and the towers. They should be well staffed. Excellence all [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  around. One witness described it as a big ball of fire and wreckage just falling down towards the river. Here's what it sounded like in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=249.6s)]
*  tower. Crash crash crash. This is alert three crash crash crash. This is alert three. Where's the alert three. It is all the approach and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  the runway three three approach and the runway three three helicopter crash. This is the deadliest air disaster in America since 9 11. No one's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=267.92s)]
*  blaming the American Airlines pilots. Planes can't get out of the way as easy as choppers. The Blackhawk pilots were pretty experienced. The male [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=276.24s)]
*  pilot had a thousand hours under his belt. The female pilot had five hundred. So what happened tonight. We're learning that the air traffic [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  control tower at Reagan National was understaffed. The New York Times breaking the story that one controller was doing the job of two. The [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=293.36s)]
*  controller who is handling helicopters was also instructing planes that were landing and departing from its runways. That's not normal. That means [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  you're using two frequencies and the plane pilots can't hear the helicopter pilots. Reagan National has had staffing shortages for a while. They're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  supposed to have 30 air traffic controllers in the tower. They only had 19. This is the busiest runway in America and they're down 11 guys. In [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=321.88s)]
*  fact the Washington Post is reporting that just Tuesday another jet trying to land aborted and had to make a second approach after a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=332.68s)]
*  helicopter appeared on its flight path. The president briefed the nation this morning and said D.E.I. could be a factor. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office. And here's one. The FAA's diversity push [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=348.28s)]
*  includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing. Brilliant people have to be in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=360.08s)]
*  those positions and their lives are actually shortened very substantially shortened because of the stress where you have many many planes [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  coming into one target. And you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it. Secretary Pete Buttigieg a real [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=378.32s)]
*  winner. That's a guy's a real winner. You know how badly everything's run since he's run this Department of Transportation. He's a disaster. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=389.84s)]
*  He was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground and he's a disaster now. He's just got a good line of. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  Anytime you mention D.E.I. the press goes crazy because that's their baby. And yet know the names of the 67 people who were killed. And you are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=407.28s)]
*  blaming Democrats and D.E.I. policies and air traffic control. Don't you think you're getting ahead of the investigation right now. I don't think so at all. I don't think [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=417.16s)]
*  with the names of the people you mean the names of the people that are on the plane. You think that's going to make a difference. They are they are a group of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=424.92s)]
*  people that have lost their lives. If you want a list of the names we can give you that we'll be giving that very soon. We're in coordination with American [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=433.52s)]
*  Airlines. We're in coordination very strongly obviously with the military. But I think that's not a very smart question. I'm surprised coming from you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=441.12s)]
*  And the D.E.I. defenders didn't stop. I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=449.84s)]
*  crash because I have common sense. OK. And unfortunately a lot of people don't. We want brilliant people doing this. This is a major chess game at the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=458.52s)]
*  highest level. When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time and they're all coming in different directions and you're dealing with very high [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=469.44s)]
*  level computer computer work and very complex computers. And one of the other things I will tell you is that the systems that were built I was going to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=478.52s)]
*  rebuild the entire system. And then we had an election that didn't turn out the way it should have. Now we don't know what factor D.E.I. played here. Could have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=489.36s)]
*  been a mechanical issue could have been medical. They've just recovered one of the black boxes and this investigation is going to tell us the truth. But when [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=498.56s)]
*  D.E.I. is in place which it was at the FAA standards get lowered. Staffings affected. And when there's a disaster like this it makes everyone naturally [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=507.24s)]
*  suspicious. Late in the Obama Biden administration a thousand well qualified air traffic control applicants were rejected for not being diverse [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=516.96s)]
*  enough. That caused staffing shortages and the Biden administration was sued for discriminating against qualified white applicants. The covid shutdowns [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=527.24s)]
*  didn't help staffing either. They stopped training controllers for two years. How were air traffic controllers not essential workers. I have no idea. And [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=537.44s)]
*  this D.E.I. thing isn't just a race thing. Biden instituted D.E.I. quotas at the FAA in order to recruit workers who were deaf vision impaired missing limbs [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=546.66s)]
*  completely paralyzed epileptic people who were severely intellectually disabled psychiatrically disabled and dwarfs. This was Biden's FAA just two years ago. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=558.62s)]
*  We need a diverse group of air traffic controllers to bring distinct perspectives to handle the ever changing aerospace landscape. I'm calling on students and alumni from [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=573.78s)]
*  HBC use Hispanic serving institutions and tribal colleges to apply now to become air traffic controllers. Prime Time also found this little slide show from the Biden FAA [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  titled Rethinking Diversity and it says diversity plus inclusion equals better performance. That's true. A major problem was that the FAA couldn't even fill their [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=599.78s)]
*  own D.E.I. quotas. According to lawsuits they discriminated against qualified candidates to hire diverse candidates but they weren't able to hire enough diverse [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=612.54s)]
*  candidates. Air traffic control towers are short staffed across the country. The agency has a thousand fewer certified controllers today than it did a decade ago. Only one [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=622.18s)]
*  percent of air traffic facilities met their staffing targets last year. One percent. Why is the FAA the only agency in the federal government short staffed. Every other [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=634.7399999999999s)]
*  agency has the opposite problem. They have too much personnel only at the FAA. They can't find enough people. Is that because you can't work remotely to be an air traffic [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=645.94s)]
*  controller. And it's not about money. Biden and Trump spent the exact same amount on the FAA. This is about mismanagement. And that's the president's point. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  Are you saying race or gender played a role in this tragedy. I don't know. Incompetence might have played a role. Well we'll let you know that. But we want the most [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=668.26s)]
*  competent people. We don't care what race they are. We want the most competent people especially in those positions. And you know you're talking about extremely complex [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  things. And if they don't have a great brain a great power of the brain they're not going to be very good at what they do and bad things will happen. This is about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=689.58s)]
*  competence and it starts at the top. In less than 24 hours the president came out held an open ended press conference with the secretaries of transportation and defense and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=698.9s)]
*  his VP and then took questions in the oval and signed a presidential memo to get to the bottom of things. As a reminder this is who Joe Biden nominated to run the FAA. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=707.66s)]
*  What airspace requires an ADS-B transponder. Quickly please. Thank you for the question senator. Not sure I can answer that question right now. So what are the six types of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=718.7s)]
*  special use airspace that protect this national security that appear on FAA charts. Quickly please. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  Sorry senator I cannot answer that question. So what are the operational limitations of a pilot flying under basic med. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=740.14s)]
*  Well thank you for the question senator. I'm not a pilot. So you tell me what the minimum separation distances for landing and departing airliners during the daytime. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=747.18s)]
*  Mr. Washington. I don't want to guess on that. You know there is between those two parts. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=756.02s)]
*  Forty four eight oh nine and part one oh seven. You know the difference there. No I cannot. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=762.46s)]
*  That guy had to withdraw his nomination because he was so unqualified. We've had mechanical issues with Boeing jets. Tulsi Gabbard was put on a TSA watch list. We've had near misses [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=767.02s)]
*  over and over again. These things should never happen in the United States of America. And a crash like this should never happen again. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=779.5799999999999s)]
*  Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of these victims. We are so sorry for your loss. This is just such a senseless tragedy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=788.98s)]
*  But a sad day for this country. Some difficult news from D.C. our nation's capital. There are no survivors from last night's horrific mid air collision between an army Blackhawk [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=797.18s)]
*  helicopter and that regional passenger jet near Reagan National Airport. All told 67 people lost their lives including 64 passengers and crew on American Airlines flight [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=806.74s)]
*  53 42. All three soldiers aboard the Blackhawk helicopter are lost. Tonight we are praying for the victims. We're praying for their families. There are no words that can [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=818.58s)]
*  truly encapsulate the scale of this tragedy. And now Americans are searching for answers as they should. How could a Blackhawk Army helicopter crash into a passenger jet [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=830.0200000000001s)]
*  that was landing at Reagan National at this hour. I wish I had all the answers. I don't. I can't tell you exactly how or why this happened. But we are gleaning [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=841.34s)]
*  information that is quite alarming. According to a report John Solomon Just the News dot com. Last night's mid air collision was preceded by months and years now [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=851.46s)]
*  of near misses and safety warnings. Look at this in 2023. There were 19 near misses at airports all across the country. That is one of the largest totals in many [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=862.98s)]
*  years in 2024. More of the same including at Reagan National Airport where multiple collisions were narrowly avoided. Look at this headline from May of 2024. Quote [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=874.22s)]
*  Federal officials are investigating another close call between planes at Reagan National Airport. And as John Solomon is pointing out an expert report sent to the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=886.0600000000001s)]
*  FAA under Biden warned directly quote America's air traffic control system is suffering from quality control issues and staffing shortages that put safety at risk. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=896.9s)]

*  alleged that the FAA turned away nearly a thousand air traffic control applicants solely based on their race. As reported by The Washington Times a 2013 FAA [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=990.14s)]

*  Democrats were playing woke politics with our lives. Apparently the FAA included these insane D.E.I. directors on their website until just a few days [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1012.14s)]
*  ago when Donald Trump signed that executive order banning D.E.I. across government agencies. Now we don't know how last night's crash occurred. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1021.42s)]
*  We'll be very clear about that. But one thing is clear. Sirens have been blaring the last number of years. And under Biden and pothole Pete and Kamala [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1030.5800000000002s)]

*  It's funny. And finally a new study says that dads could get postpartum depression too. Not if you nail the nanny said one man. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1201.46s)]
*  OK let's do this. Settle down kids. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1219.38s)]
*  So why is it that the source of many of our country's problems can be traced to innocuous phrases like when a doctor says it's a simple procedure and two minutes later he's got his fist up my butt. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1222.7s)]
*  It's how liberals work. They give things titles and names that sound so benign things like gender affirming care undocumented immigrants or pregnant people. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1239.1000000000001s)]
*  But add to that NGOs. It stands for non-governmental organization. Something non-government. How could that be bad. True. It sounds safe even boring. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1252.3000000000002s)]
*  I hear non-governmental organization and I'm like see you later. I'm off to one of my slaughterhouses to butcher an unprofitable racehorse. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1266.5800000000002s)]
*  Wow. That one landed. This is a tough crowd. Not laughing about butchered horses. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1275.3400000000001s)]
*  See I actually thought NGOs were charities like the ones I support for homeless runway models. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1285.06s)]
*  What's it called. I don't know. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1295.42s)]
*  But NGOs are not charities far from it. Many powerful NGOs have fueled America's illegal crisis by subverting the laws by actively transporting migrants into the country moving them from one city to the next to avoid detection and basically throwing your money around like Hunter in the champagne room at the rubbed tug lounge. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1299.94s)]
*  They provide transportation to get illegal to our border with shelter and services along the way and legal services to circumvent our immigration laws once they arrive. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  Now you must have wondered as you watched the migrants streaming across the border how did they even get to that point. Who was aiding and supplying them. Those migrants. They didn't appear hungry or desperate. They were mostly well fed dudes in decent clothes with backpacks and cellphones. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1331.62s)]
*  They were better off than my writers. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1346.86s)]
*  True one of them has scurvy but you know I tell him he's got a pirate's tan. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1351.8999999999999s)]
*  So who was behind this. Well as it turns out you and I are without our knowledge. Yeah you assumed NGOs didn't have their fingers in your wallet when in reality they're pickpocketing you like an illegal on the A train and they profit from doing things that were considered illegal for Uncle Sam to do himself. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1357.9399999999998s)]
*  And they receive a bulk of their funding from us. But under Trump as always we learn about the stuff that's been made deliberately complicated. So we don't learn about it. Last week he signed an executive order suspending refugee admissions into the U.S. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1375.1000000000001s)]
*  And soon after that the State Department issued a freeze on foreign aid and that freeze included a stop work order to their NGO partner refugee groups effectively halting their funding. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1390.7s)]
*  And perhaps the biggest scam since I sold all that counterfeit propycia to Jesse. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1402.54s)]
*  Now. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1409.22s)]
*  But now these groups are furious because for years under Biden State Department they've been using your money to help the migrant train from South America to your town. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1411.78s)]
*  Now I don't blame them for being pissed. Human trafficking just got a lot less profitable. But it's crazy. We go to work and the government uses our taxes to help criminals break our laws. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1421.02s)]
*  And when Trump decides to solve the problem out comes Hitler. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1431.4199999999998s)]
*  The fear and the panic and the division is I think something that we should all be concerned about. When you start having Gestapo raids in America. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1436.02s)]
*  If that sounds vaguely familiar that's because it is similar similarities to what happened in Germany. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  You know what else is similar to what happened in Germany. Everything everything you can compare except I don't remember people sneaking into Nazi Germany that pushing people off subway platforms and getting free hotels. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1453.1s)]
*  But then again I slept through college. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1466.9399999999998s)]
*  Speaking of violent crime watch what Stephen Miller does to Jake Tapper. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1471.1s)]
*  The Department of Agriculture says that between 2020 and 2022 42 percent of crop workers were undocumented immigrants. And in many cases as you know these migrants do jobs many Americans do not want to do. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1475.54s)]
*  I'm sure it's not your position Jake. You're just asking the question that we should supply America's food with exploitative illegal alien labor. I obviously don't think that's what you're implying. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1489.7s)]
*  Only one percent of alien workers in the entire country work in agriculture. The illegal aliens that Joe Biden brought into our country are not full stop doing farm work. They are not the illegal aliens he brought in from Venezuela from Haiti from Nicaragua. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1500.98s)]
*  They are not doing farm work there in our cities collecting welfare. Nice. And so. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1515.9399999999998s)]
*  And so Tapper believes illegals do what Americans don't want to do. But sorry Jake even they won't watch CNN. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1521.22s)]
*  But as always you also have the grandstanding political hacks going against what America wants. Here's Minneapolis mayor Jacob Fry. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1536.42s)]
*  I want to speak directly to people who are undocumented. We love you. We will stand up for you and we will do anything in our power to help. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1545.02s)]
*  Because you're not an alien in our city you're a neighbor. Our police officers will not be cooperating with federal law enforcement around federal immigration law. We enforce state and local laws here as for cooperation with ICE. The answer is no. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1557.18s)]
*  Man we got we have to stop electing theater kids to government. That guy should be hosting blues clues. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1573.5s)]
*  So now whether this funding freeze works or not at least America is finally seeing the grift at work. Trump does it again. He pulls that curtain back and now you start to understand how we got to this place. And it's so ugly you think you're watching the view. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1583.66s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1597.46s)]
*  His act puts more people to sleep than Bill Cosby actor writer comedian Jamie LaSalle. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1601.66s)]
*  He once checked my prostate over Zoom. Host of Ask Dr. Drew on Rumble Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1609.46s)]
*  At the gym she does Atlas shrugs. New York Times bestselling author and Fox News get driven. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1619.26s)]
*  And he went from cracking skulls to splitting sides. New York Times bestselling author comedian and former NWA world champion. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1627.26s)]
*  Jamie good to see you wear a T-shirt tonight. Yeah didn't expect to see it but I'm glad you wore it. Did you know what an NGO was before tonight. I thought it was like something like the Peace Corps. I'm familiar familiar from the middle of the bingo song. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1638.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1654.3799999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1664.7s)]
*  What I like I did not I did not know what it was and I watched that I still still kind of don't. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1667.02s)]
*  How about the Trump is doing what he said he was going to do which I like to see right like he's doing what he said he was going to do. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1673.62s)]
*  And I think that's commendable. You don't see that from politicians ever. I never saw that from my ex wife. I remember this one time she goes till death do us part. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1680.82s)]
*  But it is a confusing you know it's it's I get that it's a touchy subject. I don't know if you know this but I actually dated an illegal immigrant for her as she was my girlfriend. And every time we would do some intimate in bed I was like again she's doing jobs. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1694.82s)]
*  American women don't want to do. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1707.8999999999999s)]
*  Terrible terrible Dr. Drew. You and I both our eyes met almost romantically. Jacob Fry said he wouldn't cooperate. Yeah to me it seemed like isn't that breaking federal law and is it up in jail. Fine. Fine. He doesn't want his local officers participating but he is defying federal law which is the law of the land. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1717.22s)]
*  Also it's the people want it. People voted for this. You douchebag. Not you. This is the part that drives me crazy. And I am so I don't get it. How how does the press still not understand the difference between somebody who's here illegally undocumented illegally and somebody who went through the process. I'm from an immigrant family. It took forever. And they were escaping desperate circumstances and still you had to pay from Chicago. They ended up they ended up in Chicago. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1737.18s)]
*  And so from bad to worse. But but the point is that what do they think that when they say America is built on immigrants. Yeah. Who went through this incredible procedure had to prove what they had to offer the country how they were going to make money what they were going to do when they got here and then live up to that. I think it's insulting the way they use the word asylum and all these asylum laws and rules and how they're just people get asylum and then they go back and they visit the place they're claiming asylum from. That doesn't work. No one was going back to Nazi Germany to check on their plants. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1767.18s)]
*  No cats. Were you following this NGO phenomenon. I was worried about doing this story because even I was like going do people know enough to care. But then you find out like we used to watch this and go like why are all how did all these people get here. They didn't walk one thousand miles. Now we know that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1797.18s)]
*  Well the story is very confusing. I mean it's very it's convoluted. And I also know that my brain's not operating in its highest capacity in my current state. So it could be that. But one thing that I had the biggest. It's not just immigration stuff. It's a few different kind of NGOs foreign aid all these different things. I'm just really confused. Maybe you guys can help because they're called NGOs who stand for non-governmental organizations. Yeah. So why are they called that. If now when they're saying that Trump briefly [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1816.38s)]
*  freezing funding is going to they're not going to make it. Yeah exactly. How do they get to be called that. If even a freeze in government funding means like well we're going to have to shut our doors. What have you done. Why are you called that. Yes. Am I missing something. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1846.38s)]
*  That makes sense. NGO is a fancy way of saying leech. They're just they attach to the government and they just suck the blood. But it's our blood cat. It's just it's almost like the person who's like well I wasn't doing. I wasn't doing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1862.8200000000002s)]
*  exactly what they were doing. Reminder how they did. How they got around to gain a function. Yes. Have somebody else do it. We'll call it. We'll call it Peter Dazak's lab in North Carolina. We'll call it an NGO. Yeah I don't know. Tyrus are you familiar with this whole phenomenon. Yeah. But when we were I'm coming from was called the front. Yeah. Call it. You have a very successful bodega that never has food in it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1876.38s)]
*  And routine stops every three or four weeks by certain guys with a Colombian accent. Chances are it might be a front. This is a front and they can put anyone they want in that position. This is how the little Biden's reward. This is how you get your information. You pay that ten thousand dollar dinner or whatever it was or give him his little diamond ring in China and then your buddies get us over even though it doesn't sound like that. But that's exactly what it is. And you a little program where you go out and help [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1906.38s)]
*  young military age men find their way in their their place by placing them on buses at midnight and rushing and then dropping them off just in time for the cameras that seem to go. They've walked 10,000 miles to be here. Yes. In white shoes. Yeah. Right. Right. Everyone's got a good meal and they're on the phone. Yeah I just got here where you're at. English is better than ours. So it's just a front. And what it is is he's again he's coming in in this situation. He doesn't have to run for reelection. He doesn't need the money. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zSmzwbqXo&t=1936.38s)]
*  They have no influence on him. So he's taking what he's starting to hit him at the roots. And you're going to see the dirtiest most corrupt politicians fight this ferociously. And they're saying the Hitler stuff but it's not working because you've said Hitler so much that doesn't mean anything anymore which is a shame because that's a word you should always be worried about.
