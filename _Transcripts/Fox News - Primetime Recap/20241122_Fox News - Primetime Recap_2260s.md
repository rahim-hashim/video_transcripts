# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 21, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw)
*  Who let the doge out. That's the focus of tonight's angle. One thing should be really clear by now. The Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=0.0s)]
*  bureaucracy will do anything in its power to avoid accountability. They want to spend your money with impunity on whatever [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  floats their boat. Transparency for the swamp is what modesty is for the Kardashians. Now this partly explains the Biden [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  administration's mad scramble to Trump proof various departments and agencies insulating their pet projects from extinction and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=28.4s)]
*  their staff from accountability. And Rio this week Biden tried feebly to protect his climate agenda. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=38.08s)]
*  I'm leaving office in January. I will have my sick. I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=46.04s)]
*  if they choose to do so. It's true. Some may seek to deny or delay clean energy revolution that's underway in America. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=55.48s)]
*  But nobody nobody can reverse. Nobody. Nobody. Who can take him seriously in that Tommy Bahamas shirt or whatever. I can't take [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=65.88s)]
*  him seriously. So what's the implication here that the voters they don't have a say. Same playbook they used during Covid fear and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  control whether you like it or not. Because government experts say so. This is the single greatest existential threat to humanity. If we [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=86.24s)]
*  do not deal with climate change our children our great grandchildren our great great grandchildren their future is going to be [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=95.4s)]
*  determined by what we do in the next four to six years. Those participants behind him seem really engaged. Well wait he did for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=102.16s)]
*  the next four to six years. Well given that Trump has pledged to pull back on the climate change agenda the Department of Energy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=111.16s)]
*  right now is racing to blow close to 25 billion dollars in pending loans to supposedly green businesses. Now Biden apparently [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=119.92s)]
*  wants to cement his climate legacy according to Politico. So should these federal energy department loan guarantees even continue at all. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=129.84s)]
*  After all the 465 million loan to Elon Musk's electric car company that worked out so well and it did that he was able to pay it off [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=139.64s)]
*  early. Two thumbs up for that. But of course there's also the infamous cylindra debacle leaving taxpayers on the hook for more than [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  five hundred million dollars before that went belly up. So will doge recommend that Trump do away with a loan program that gave Tesla [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=156.08s)]
*  such a huge boost. It's unclear. But Trump repeatedly said that he wanted to cut the money off in his first term. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=164.08s)]
*  And our bloated government there's waste and there's inefficiency. We know it. And more than that there's fraud everywhere. Hundreds of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  billions of dollars. We know we're stolen during Covid. That was the PPE fraud. All those people applying who didn't deserve the money. But [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  there's also welfare fraud as well. You guys have a sense of how much is being stolen. Billions billions of billions with a B. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=189.84s)]
*  Every year the quality control issues that we have are miniscule compared to the fraud. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  That is terrifying. So when taxpayers find out how much of their money is wasted on superfluous inefficient pointless whacked out junk. And [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=208.92s)]
*  then on top of that the hundreds of billions in fraud trillions over the years undoubtedly. I think there's going to be a groundswell of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=219.2s)]
*  support for the work that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have pledged to do at Doge. Now by the way to ensure that they control their own [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  messaging the duo is even launching their own podcast. This is brilliant. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=236.24s)]
*  Elon and I are going to start a separate track of Doge casts that explain exactly what we're doing to the public to provide transparency in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=242.52s)]
*  what is a once in a generation project. We want to bring the public along with us to lift the curtain to take us behind the scenes of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  what actually that waste fraud and abuse in government looks like. However bad you think it is it's probably worse. But we don't want to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=256.68s)]
*  do this to just expose the problem. We want to do it to solve the problem. Now this is sending shivers up and down the spines of not [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  just senior officials and the outgoing administration but the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who never came back to work after [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=272.16s)]
*  the pandemic. That's a good gig. Nearly two thirds of the more than two point two million federal workers are still approved to work [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=280.24s)]
*  from home. This is a total joke. Of course it's also killing D.C. small businesses. It's so bad that liberal mayor Muriel Bowser is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=290.52s)]
*  pleading for Trump to somehow get the workers back into the city. Last year the government accountability office concluded that 17 of the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=299.32s)]
*  24 largest federal agencies used on average only 25 percent of their office space. I don't know what can you turn them into yoga [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  studios dance studios apartments. How about this idea. For those who don't show up to work. Well you're obviously not that essential. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=319.04s)]
*  This from Elon and the Vakes Wall Street Journal column the number of federal employees to cut should be at least proportionate to the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=328.72s)]
*  number of federal regulations that are nullified. Fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations but the agency would produce fewer [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited. Here here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=344.12s)]
*  It is long since time to return power to the people. Doge will rely both on the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent as the authority to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=350.8s)]
*  enact these sweeping reforms. And again this prospect is absolutely terrifying. Democrats bureaucrats freeloaders and all the companies [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=360.8s)]
*  that should never have gotten government contracts in the first place. The reflexive response of the swamp under scrutiny never changes [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=371.48s)]
*  though lies and personal attacks. There's no mandate here but what there certainly should not be is a blank check to appoint a chaos [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=378.58s)]
*  cabinet like he's done. It's like the Star Wars Cantina of cabinets and it's going to really jeopardize America's safety. Safety. Wait wait wait. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  Wasserman show safety. We have a president right now who can't find his way into a photo shoot authorizing Ukraine to shoot U.S. made [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=399.67999999999995s)]
*  missiles deep into Russia. And she's talking about safety. Right now Europe is on high alert because of what Biden Biden's puppet [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=407.84s)]
*  master is doing to ramp up the aggression almost begging Putin to respond. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=415.84s)]
*  And all this is happening as our vice president. Is resting up. After her loss in Hawaii. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=421.44s)]
*  You cannot make this up. None of this is acceptable. Their terrible record at home and abroad is the main reason that Harris lost. And [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  they're not changing a darn thing. At least not yet. Who thinks Harris is even aware that the Pentagon authorized another two hundred and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  seventy five million for Ukraine today. Well just another effort to trump proof our foreign policy and military expenditures. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=446.6s)]
*  But everyone tonight remember this as the trump proofing continues. Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress were elected [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=458.16s)]
*  because the American people do not trust our unelected bureaucrats to do the right thing. Too much money has been wasted over too many [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=465.8s)]
*  years. Too many mistakes have been made with zero repercussions. And now the bureaucrats in Washington are going to learn that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=474.44s)]
*  Trump and the voters aren't kidding. We mean business. And this time we're going to have our way. And that's the angle. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=483.28s)]
*  Fox News alert. Donald Trump just tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be his next A.G. This after Matt Gates withdrew [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=493.76s)]
*  his bid earlier today. We'll have more on that in a bit. But first Biden's been soaking up his final days at the White House and it's been a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=501.92s)]
*  little lonely for the big guy. He tried throwing a birthday party but Barack didn't show. Kamala's in Hawaii and Nancy took away his cake. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=510.36s)]
*  Happy birthday Joe. We got you a cake. But Nancy Pelosi insisted you sacrifice it for the good of democracy. But today they let Joe out for some [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=519.16s)]
*  fresh air and they even gave him a basketball. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=527.84s)]
*  I don't know. I know these guys behind me but they just showed up. I don't know where the hell I came from. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=531.96s)]
*  Biden's dribbling around the Rose Garden to we are the champions while the rest of the party is in mourning. Nance is still having [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=557.84s)]
*  nightmares. Has it been 30 weeks. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=572.48s)]
*  Just think of it as every morning that I get up and it's another morning of the reality the reckoning. Yes she's not coping too well after [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=577.64s)]
*  the coup. Pelosi is still saying it wasn't her fault. Behind the scenes you were very instrumental in encouraging President Biden to leave the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=585.36s)]
*  race. Even before he did polls were showing that the voters were very concerned about his age. Do you wish you had gotten involved earlier [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=594.6s)]
*  than you did. Let me just say the president made his own decision and I salute him for his patriotism for his selflessness and the rest for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=604.88s)]
*  the decision that he made. The blame blame not slowing down because Democrats aren't over it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  America is about dollars and cents. Sure. But we also pride ourselves in a capitalistic society and being about competition. Well when did they [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=621.72s)]
*  face competition. You didn't allow anybody to compete against them. You didn't allow leftist or Democratic voters to pick a choice. So [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  because you didn't do all of that. Wait a minute. That's not our democratic society. Now you didn't violate any laws. You didn't do anything [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=636.68s)]
*  unconstitutional. But that didn't mean that you were on the up and up. It didn't mean that you avoided being slick and shrewd and maneuvering your [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  way through it. And then you turned around and tried to guilt us and voted for you. The raging Cajun says point your finger somewhere else. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=652.76s)]
*  Biden Biden Biden Biden Biden Biden. Then you can. After that you can sort of assess blame. I think that Mary Garland is going to go down [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=660.92s)]
*  is a man so respectful of tradition and so respectful of institutions that is naive. He was trying to play by one set of rules and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=672.76s)]
*  everybody's playing by another set of rules. And you don't think he's a bad guy. I think at the end of the day he's just a horribly naive man [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=683.92s)]
*  that had no idea what he was up against. Democrats are upset. Biden didn't arrest Trump in time. They haven't learned anything. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  You have a message for people on what they should do about this existential threat. I assuming that he still believes Donald Trump is an [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=704.92s)]
*  existential threat. Look his his his thoughts and what he said his his thinking on that has not changed. It has not. So I thought we were [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=713.4799999999999s)]
*  supposed to get a peaceful transfer of power but it's looking like another resistance. Biden's sabotaging Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=721.24s)]
*  He's handing Zelensky long range American made missiles and he's shooting them deep into Russia. Now Putin's putting the nuclear option on the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=729.56s)]
*  table. So before Trump even gets into office he's going to have to wiggle his way out of World War Three. Plus Joe's sending every last [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=737.28s)]
*  dollar into Ukraine and billions more to his green buddies to build windmills and chargers. And now he's putting together a high speed [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=744.86s)]
*  conveyor belt for migrants to come in before Trump does. He's giving you remember the open table for a legal zap. It's getting an upgrade. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=752.92s)]
*  Biden's new app lets Jose and Maria stay in the country and skip having to check in with ICE. It's really just an app to make [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  illegals invisible. It's like an app to keep them in the shadows. So Tom Homan has a harder time finding them. This after D.A. Alvin Bragg's [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=769.36s)]
*  assistant just got mugged by an illegal Venezuelan gangbanger with a lengthy rap sheet. Meanwhile Democrat governors and mayors are building a wall [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=778.24s)]
*  but it's not the kind of wall you think. They're building walls of cops around their cities to keep ICE out. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=787.84s)]
*  We're not going to cooperate. We're not going to ask our police force to serve as ICE agents. We're not going to do that. We're going to do [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=795.0s)]
*  everything in our power to protect people in this city. Everything. So in other words we would do whatever is necessary. It's unlawful. You can't use [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=802.48s)]
*  the military. You can't do mass deportations. We're not going to do that. So when the mayor of Denver says you're going to see Tiananmen Square like [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  resistance. What does that mean. ICE agents are going to show up to Denver and they're going to get into a Mexican standoff with the local sheriff. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=821.64s)]
*  Liberals are going to stand in front of ICE vans to protect illegal rapists from getting picked up and flown home. ICE agents aren't calling the mayor of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=830.0799999999999s)]
*  Denver and saying you know we're coming to 16th Street tomorrow at seven o'clock to round up Biden migrants. No it's not happening that way. These federal [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=838.8s)]
*  fugitive teams are going to show up whenever they want wherever they want. And local yoke liberals aren't going to have a clue. No one's stopping that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  Republicans have the will of the people at their back and walking around with a new confidence. The squad tried to get smart at a hearing yesterday [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=855.76s)]
*  and Clay Higgins from Louisiana told her what time it is. Please keep Dr. Martin King Jr.'s name out of your mouth. You're a perversion of his [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=864.28s)]

*  man. I'm not surprised that you would deny American history. I appreciate my Democrat colleague for exemplifying exactly the kind of oppression of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=886.04s)]
*  freedoms that we're referencing. How about we'll quote whoever we want to quote. That's exactly the kind of baked in oppression. Like how dare a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=897.12s)]
*  white Republican quote Martin Luther King. We actually had a congressman say that just now. Democrats are fracturing into two camps. The [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=911.0s)]
*  resistance faction who learned nothing from November 5th and is going to basically lay sticks of dynamite down on the tracks of the Trump train. The other [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=921.24s)]
*  faction is going to start listening. They're going to pick their battles but cooperate where they can. Millions on the left define themselves by [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=929.2s)]
*  what they're against. Trump. But now the resistance is kind of petering out. They don't know who they are. Newsome diagnosed it this way. He says a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=938.44s)]
*  lot of people feel like they're losing their identity or losing their future and he's hitting the streets of California kind of like Johnny to figure out [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=948.08s)]
*  why his state moved right. But Gavin doesn't need a listening tour. It's common sense. Trump's already making plans to revive the Keystone pipeline. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=956.48s)]
*  Europe's preparing for a peace summit. And in Jerusalem they're putting up banners that say welcome back dear friend. The world's ready to move on [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=966.48s)]
*  from Biden. America's ready. Even Democrats are ready. Joe's going to Nantucket for Thanksgiving and he'll be deciding when Hunter gets his pardon on Black Friday [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=975.64s)]
*  or on Inauguration Day. Maybe he'll stuff a pardon in his son's stocking on Christmas morning even though he's been a naughty little boy. Tonight we begin with a Fox [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=986.2s)]
*  News alert. It is another good night for Republicans. President elect Donald Trump has announced his new pick for attorney general. That is Pam [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=995.64s)]
*  Bondi. Now this is a terrific nomination for many many reasons. Now Pam worked as a prosecutor for nearly two decades was the first woman elected [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1003.16s)]
*  two time elected attorney general. The great state of Florida where she served for eight years. Pam Bondi known for being tough on crime worked hard [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1013.08s)]
*  to curb drug trafficking pill mills in Florida. And during her tenure Florida became one of the safest states in the country. Florida's balance of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1021.4s)]
*  freedom and security is a big reason why people like me and so many others have decided to move to the great free state of Florida in the past decade. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1030.64s)]
*  Now as we continue of course during the election one of the top concerns for voters it was rising crime wasn't it. You're small towns big cities all across the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1039.8000000000002s)]
*  country. This nomination is a clear sign that President elect Trump intends to make good on his promise to make America safe again. If you need any more [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1048.24s)]
*  evidence in that Pam Bondi will do a great job. Take a look at the reaction at MSDNC. Kind of priceless actually. Take a look. Pam Bondi is exactly [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1058.36s)]
*  what I was saying in the last segment that we should all fear because she's competent. We may not agree with her ideologically but she actually knows how to do [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1068.9199999999998s)]
*  this job. So if anyone on the Democratic side or anyone who cared about liberty or justice was thinking well maybe Matt Gates will screw this up and that'll give us [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  some time. No Pam Bondi knows what she's doing. She is a dangerous and effective pick and that's frankly worse than what we would have gotten with Matt Gates. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1084.0s)]
*  I think Matt Gates who saw that politically was becoming untenable. I think they both share the same values in this sense is we must not ever weaponize the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1094.2s)]
*  Department of Justice. What they did to Donald Trump and people around him can never ever happen again ever. And we've got to restore institutions like the FBI [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1102.96s)]
*  the CIA to their former greatness because they have been politicized weaponized. That has to end. It can't be they go after us when they're in power. We go after [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1112.52s)]
*  them when they're in power. No this has to end altogether. In other good news Democrats sore loser Bob Casey. Wow. Amazing. He finally conceded weeks after [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1121.56s)]
*  Republican challenger Dave McCormick was declared the winner. Republicans now have a 53 seat majority in the U.S. Senate even though vote counting continues in [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1130.8s)]
*  California the 2024 elections pretty much now in the rear view mirror and after a humiliating loss Democrats they kind of stop pretending the mask is [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1139.68s)]
*  coming off. In other words the big lie. You know they're not pretending anymore. They're no longer the party of hardworking middle class men and women all of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1150.0400000000002s)]
*  you watching this show the people that make this country great. Get up work hard play by the rules pay your taxes obey the laws take your kids to church [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1158.2s)]
*  study with them at night cook them dinner. You make the country great because they literally don't care. They don't care about the people that make America [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1167.6s)]
*  great. They are. They are you know West Coast elitist and East Coast elitist Hollywood San Francisco New York D.C. That's them. The DHS Secretary [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1175.72s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas the FBI director. They won't even bother to show up for their annual hearing on threats to our homeland. By the way threats created by [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1186.44s)]
*  Harris and Biden and Mayorkas and their insane open borders crimes that should have been stopped by the FBI director who had had an opportunity to [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1196.8s)]
*  change course and reclaim the greatness of the finest law enforcement institution ever designed by man. And the first time in 15 years [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1206.92s)]
*  America's top security officials will not tell you was state of safety and security in our country. Now they're accused of skipping out to avoid quote [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1217.52s)]
*  awkward questions about the heinous murder of Lake and Riley at the hands of an illegal immigrant just sentenced to life in prison should have gotten the death [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1227.72s)]
*  penalty in my view. Sadly Lakeland is only one of a long list. We show you this. We showed you this throughout the whole campaign. Americans murdered [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1235.48s)]
*  raped assaulted by unvetted Harris Biden illegal immigrants you know who were welcomed into our country for now almost four straight years. But Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1245.04s)]
*  and the FBI director Christopher Ray they don't seem concerned to warn the American people. Christopher Ray has been saying the threat level has never been [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1256.56s)]
*  this bad. Now that the election is over say what they're no longer pretending to care. In fact the Biden administration they just loosened illegal [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1264.44s)]
*  immigration restrictions yet again. Biden's DHS is now allowing all illegals who are abusing the asylum process aided and abetted by Harris and [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1273.66s)]
*  Biden to skip their in-person check ins at an ice office and just use an app that's not working too well to check in. According to Fox News dot com [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1283.5400000000002s)]
*  quote the app reportedly has severe glitching issues does not track a migrant's location if he or she is using an Android phone or a laptop. And [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1292.5800000000002s)]
*  further the app does not check illegal immigrants for past arrest outstanding warrants. Now what does that mean. That increases the odds [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1302.3s)]
*  dramatically that they will not be discovered ever again. That includes known terrorists in this country murderers rapists gang members [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1310.34s)]
*  cartel members other violent criminals. In other words Harris Biden Mayorkas their legacy is one where they have literally put what they [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1320.5s)]
*  consider the rights and there are no rights for illegal immigrants but the rights of the illegals in their mind over every single American safety [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1329.42s)]
*  and security. And they put it over the rule of law and our constitution. One New York City council member remarked this doesn't seem to be in the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1338.6200000000001s)]
*  spirit of the peaceful transition that Biden promised. I don't think so. I think that that city council member is right. And the problems don't stop [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1346.66s)]
*  there. According to a report from the House Judiciary Committee criminals might actually be using Biden's lax parole program to traffic [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1354.82s)]
*  women young girls across the border sex trafficking prostitution. The report also shows quote welfare recipients people involved with [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1363.66s)]
*  criminal activity and even other illegal immigrants have been approved as sponsors for those paroled after crossing the border [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1374.1399999999999s)]
*  illegally. Remember on the campaign trail when borders are Kamala Harris claim she tried so hard to secure the border. But Republicans they got in [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1382.94s)]
*  the way. No her bill was an amnesty bill that it will allow two million people in the country every year unvetted of course. And it also gave them [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1391.54s)]
*  discretion not to enforce the law. She was straight up lying. But now she's at it once again totally unbothered by what has been Kamala Harris [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1399.58s)]
*  still vice president still borders are on a lavish vacation in Hawaii. Not a care in the world. And as for your president Joe Biden [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1409.02s)]
*  he's still president. Days are short. The naps are long and the ability to do much of anything is waiting before our very eyes. Take a look. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1417.5s)]
*  I didn't know any of these guys behind me but they just showed up. I don't know where the hell I came from. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1426.78s)]
*  Twenty twenty four NBA champions the balls. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1430.98s)]
*  Your cell is right. The Boston Celtics. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1439.06s)]
*  Why is that not funny. A sad tragic end to a terrible presidency. And while Democrats while they struggle to pick up the pieces maybe they [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1445.54s)]
*  could take some notes from Donald Trump. Voters love the president's authenticity. They love that the president elect says what he believes. And [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1455.58s)]
*  with Democrats during an election it's all smoke and it's all mirrors and it's all lies and it's all name calling. It's all demagoguery. I mean it's all [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1463.62s)]
*  disgusting and repulsive to be honest. And frankly it's exhausting. Even disgraced former NBC News anchor Brian Williams who himself to be honest [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1471.74s)]
*  knows a thing or two about smoke and mirrors. He can see what's happening and maybe that expertise actually helped him perfectly diagnose the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1480.7s)]
*  failures of the Democratic Party. Take a look at this. It is tough love time for the Democratic Party. I think it needs to be stripped down and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1488.3s)]
*  rebuilt. I think that means a change in leadership. I want to know who thought it was a good idea that Joe Biden stand for another four years at 80 [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1495.82s)]
*  years of age and 37 percent popularity. I think it's insulting when members of the working class which the Democratic Party has lost [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1505.62s)]
*  entirely in our lifetimes to insist the economy is doing great. And I think the biggest unforced error of the Biden administration by far was [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1515.54s)]
*  the border to tell people it's not a problem is insulting. Great analysis. Here's the problem. Brian why didn't you tell the country [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1525.34s)]
*  before the election. And will Democrats actually learn from this loss. All indications are they will not. The party is now so radical [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1535.38s)]
*  extreme left. It might be past the point of no return. So as Anheuser-Busch has learned one bad ad can really mess up your whole year. That [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1543.94s)]
*  company put a transgender person's face on a can of Bud Light and their stock crashed. Turns out most guys don't want to mix cheap beer and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  chicks with. And they also don't want to be told that they're bigots for feeling that way. But what about a more upscale brand like say [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1561.62s)]
*  luxury cars. Jaguar just unveiled a new ad campaign. It's got everyone talking when they aren't actually puking. And yes the obvious [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1571.74s)]
*  point will be made if they're talking about it then it worked right. I mean Alec Baldwin had everyone talking about rust. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1581.1799999999998s)]
*  Not sure that sold movie tickets. Roll it here again. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1588.26s)]
*  What the hell was that. Was that a lineup of all the previous Biden Harris cabinet picks. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1618.26s)]
*  It's weird. It's like two cans Sam followed his nose into a huge pile of cocaine. It looked more like a Kudlow hot tub party than a car ad. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1630.78s)]
*  And look if I want to see unattractive men in heavy makeup I'll watch Jesse Waters prime time. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1650.74s)]
*  And what's with the slogans create exuberance. Was that translated from Fabio's dating profile. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1655.9s)]
*  Live vivid. Sounds like something the handsy drama teacher wrote in everyone's yearbook. Copy nothing. Sounds like the Asian kid I sat next [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1667.22s)]
*  to an algebra right before every test. But I haven't seen that many empty slogans since Kamala lost. Of course all that was missing in the ad was a [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1677.06s)]
*  car. Now on one level the ad agency did its job. It made a splash on social media. But then again if I took a giant dump on a plate of mashed [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1689.42s)]
*  potatoes and put it online I'm pretty sure that would cause a splash too. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1698.54s)]
*  Which is the point. The people Jaguar is appeasing is on social media which I guess are gay Martian carnival freaks who don't buy Jaguars. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1704.02s)]
*  But as when Jaguar exec said the goal is to make you feel uncomfortable. You did it. But hey if I want to be uncomfortable I'll go to Brit [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1715.58s)]
*  Humes annual massage weekend in Sag Harbor. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1725.46s)]
*  Not invited. If you want to cause distress you could have saved a whole bunch of money just show Joe Biden eating a baby. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1733.74s)]
*  Now a lot of people assume Jaguar has gone woke. Well thanks for the connecting the dots Matlock. Last month Jaguar took part in a attitude [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1743.74s)]
*  awards which honored gay icons like Elton John and people who aren't Elton John Jaguars head of brand strategy a BLM supporting designer spoke at [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1757.6599999999999s)]
*  the event. Watch that Jaguar. We're passionate about our people and we're committed to fostering a diverse inclusive and unified culture. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1766.8999999999999s)]
*  And we're on a transformative journey of our own driven by a belief in diversity inclusion creativity policy and most importantly action. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1777.2199999999998s)]
*  We've established over 15 D.E.I. groups. We've launched major policy revisions such as transitioning at work to drive equity and support for our [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1789.34s)]
*  communities embracing individuality as our superpower. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1799.22s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1804.06s)]
*  Oh. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1804.86s)]
*  It's a car company for Christ's sake not drag queen story hour. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1813.02s)]
*  How about telling me how many friggin cup holders it has. He used more woke buzzwords enjoyed read saying grace on Thanksgiving diverse [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1819.2199999999998s)]
*  inclusive unified culture. I can't believe Biden didn't put him in charge of nuclear waste. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  And he boasted that Jaguar has 15 D.E.I. groups. Now the last time I checked Pornhub there aren't that many races. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1833.7s)]
*  But it's not just one D.E.I. group it's 15 which is evidence of the parasitic consequences of a competing but nonprofit making goal. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1844.7s)]
*  And none of them participate in the company's mission which is to make a great car that turns a profit. Instead with its own competing goal which is [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1855.46s)]
*  self-preservation it only grows like a cancer within every company it inhabits. I'm willing to bet at Jaguar there are more D.E.I. administrators than [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1863.74s)]
*  car designers. I can't wait to see what the car looks like. Want to bet it's an automatic but identifies as a stick. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1873.1000000000001s)]
*  And the next guest. She once got drunk with Gow and Jones financial analyst. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=1884.7s)]

*  marketer. So consider me the CMO on this panel. And what happened is is that all these people are just completely inoculated in their cloistered quarters on the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=2030.7s)]

*  thinks it's that which to me that's a flop and that's kind of embarrassing. Tyrus. Well you know I hate. No no. They're like too close to the black guy. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=2136.7s)]
*  He's nervous. I hate to make this political but I have to. OK. OK. I am outraged. I'm furious and I can't believe no one here saw this racist bull that's in front of us. Why is the Asian guy got to be in yellow. Why is that. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=2152.7s)]

So they had to have 15 groups and all 15 groups. And homie that was speaking couldn't figure out that it's racist to make the Asian guy wear the yellow. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0K9MfvORLw&t=2217.7s)]
