# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 6, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU)
*  Good evening everyone I'm Laura Ingram this is Ingram Angle thank you as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=0.0s)]
*  always for joining us tonight. Our control alt delete moment that's the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  focus of tonight's angle. Trump is resetting the federal government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=9.84s)]
*  Look as Gonzo over the past two weeks our strength has been restored our [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=16.8s)]
*  spirit has been revived and a new national momentum has been sweeping [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=22.28s)]
*  across our land the golden age of America has officially begun our economy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=27.2s)]
*  is roaring back to life optimism is soaring hope is returning and we have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=32.64s)]
*  brought back the words common sense to our government. He and his cabinet are [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  moving so rapidly on so many levels that Democrats are feverishly trying to keep [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=46.32s)]
*  up and when they're not filing lawsuits we'll get to that in a moment in liberal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=52.0s)]
*  jurisdictions they're scrambling to get their messaging in order. This is a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=56.0s)]
*  national emergency in the aftermath of the election many Democrats needed time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=60.4s)]
*  to soul search to grieve to think but that time has ended and that time ended [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=65.16s)]
*  when Elon Musk took control of our country's financial nuclear codes. Do [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=71.32s)]
*  they actually pay people to write those lines the nuclear financial codes? Is he [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=77.28s)]
*  kidding me? Now for liberals a 36 trillion dollar debt is not a national [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=83.64s)]
*  emergency but the Doge Cruz identifying spending scams that is a national [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=88.52s)]
*  emergency? Oh okay. Only now though are Americans beginning to really understand [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=92.96s)]
*  how deep the corruption runs in Washington and courtesy of Doge and its [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=99.72s)]
*  allies on the hill we're seeing what has tantamount to an ongoing brazen theft [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  from the US taxpayers. Now wonder the co-conspirators are all in a froth. What [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=110.28s)]
*  we are seeing unfold is an unlawful power grab by a unelected and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=116.36s)]
*  unaccountable billionaire puppet master. Look at what Musk is announcing every [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  single day that he's doing. Elon Musk take your hands off the people's money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=130.4s)]
*  Ah take your hands off the people's money. That's funny. Well the people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=136.4s)]
*  elected Donald Trump to clean up this mess and that's exactly what he's doing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=143.68s)]
*  In response Democrats only have hyperbole and of course their fallback [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=148.36s)]
*  lies. The elected Elon must have access to their personal data. There's nothing about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=152.96s)]
*  co-president Musk that is about saving the American people money. Of course [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=158.56s)]
*  that's false. He is saving us money and he is not combing through IRS files [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=165.14s)]
*  accessing people's personal data. That's what Democrats do. Like during the Obama [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=170.33999999999997s)]
*  administration when they nosed into conservatives files over at the IRS. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  Now the Democrats pigpile phase Elon Musk you think? Doesn't look like it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  because he knows that the numbers don't lie. A comprehensive audit of federal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=187.54s)]
*  spending we've needed it forever and it shows that billions upon billions of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=193.54s)]
*  dollars are being blown on moronic projects supported by globalists and of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=197.98s)]
*  course the hard left. Money flows to their ideological bedfellows for things [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=202.62s)]
*  such as 361,000 to queer trans pansexual non-binary and to spirit [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  people on how to farm. 1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbian businesses oh [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=215.66s)]
*  goody. 2 million for sex changes and LGBT activism in Guatemala. 2.5 million [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=222.34s)]
*  for EVs for Vietnam and 3 million on girl-centered climate action. Hmm? And [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=229.06s)]
*  what if you are feeling kind of stressed out and you're an employee over at USAID? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=237.02s)]
*  Well for the modest price tag of 31.5 million they hired a consultant to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  assist you with counseling, organizational resilience, wellness and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=248.9s)]
*  work-life. Is work-life balance now abbreviated to just work-life? I guess so. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=254.34s)]
*  And well okay this is all obscene we know it it's still a drop in the bucket [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=259.22s)]
*  compared to what we already knew had happened in fiscal year 2023 when Biden [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=264.14s)]
*  and company blew through 236 billion with a B in improper payments within 71 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=269.74s)]
*  federal programs 71 and by the way it was even worse in 2022 247 billion in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=277.82s)]
*  improper payments. Now try to wrap your head around this since fiscal year 2003 [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=285.98s)]
*  again this spans Republican and Democrat administrations cumulative [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=293.26s)]
*  federal improper payment estimates total about 2.7 trillion dollars. Now this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=297.5s)]
*  means people got the money and grant recipients didn't qualify for the money [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=305.98s)]
*  that they still received and that the payments were sent in some cases totally [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  an error. So 2.7 trillion over about 20 years cannot make that up. But as [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=317.5s)]
*  infuriating as it is that we're funding all of the nonsense and wasting trillions [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=324.74s)]
*  of dollars it's far more disturbing that you and I are actually subsidizing woke [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=331.18s)]
*  propaganda that's packaged as news. 3.2 million for the BBC media action group [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  they got 8% of their entire income from the American taxpayers and of course we [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=344.7s)]
*  know they all despise Trump. But wait a second Trump is attacking journalism [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=349.66s)]
*  that's what the left is saying here. Expect sob stories to start pouring in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=356.38s)]
*  but are Democrats really going to defend our funding 268 million dollars worth of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=361.14s)]
*  of grants to news outlets across the globe. I mean in a mystery novel that all [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=368.34s)]
*  would end up being some type of CIA front group because it sure sounds like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  it. Taxpayers do have a right to know where is this money going and why. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=380.82s)]
*  Apparently we're funding Zelensky's propaganda effort in Ukraine as well. How [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=386.5s)]
*  are we supposed to believe that this qualifies as a free press when it ends [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=391.62s)]
*  up in Ukraine because right now it's not free to the US taxpayers. Now no wonder [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=395.9s)]
*  the Democrats as we're finding all of this out as it's being publicized to the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=401.54s)]
*  American people and they're really beginning to to take it in slowly but [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=406.42s)]
*  surely. No wonder the Democrats are huffing and puffing. They're running to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  the courts and they're pulling stunts outside of federal buildings. Looks a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=414.42s)]
*  little insurrection at times even because their playpen is being emptied [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=418.1s)]
*  out. Their toys are disappearing one by one. But for us this is great. It's money [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=423.54s)]
*  saved. It's woke programs X'd out. Employees who are not needed have to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=432.66s)]
*  move on. Radicals on their heels. Every day it's like Christmas morning and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=438.58s)]
*  that's the angle. The Doge father's on the loose and no federal job is safe. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=445.7s)]
*  Their plan for the deep state gutted all over 40,000 federal bureaucrats have [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=451.26s)]
*  already taken buyouts and we're only in week three. We expect that number to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  increase and that alone just the 40,000 again we expected to increase is going [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=463.26s)]
*  to save the American people tens of millions of dollars and we encourage [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=468.5s)]
*  federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer. If they don't [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=472.06s)]
*  want to show up to the office if they want to rip the American people off then [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=475.86s)]
*  they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly competent individuals [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=479.94s)]
*  who want to fill these roles. Elon and his nerd army have been combing through [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=483.22s)]
*  agencies blasting away bloat. 20 year old dozers are clashing with lazy old [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=487.22s)]
*  timers who don't know how to use a computer and are calling them idiots and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=492.86s)]
*  breaking news secretary of state Marco Rubio has just fired 90 percent of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=497.22s)]
*  administrators at USAID. They took a 10,000 man agency and streamlined it to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=503.26000000000005s)]
*  300 employees. The media is calling it the Trumppocalypse. CNN cast off Oliver [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=509.62s)]
*  Darcy says the American experiment is convulsing before our eyes and he's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=516.98s)]
*  flabbergasted that the media hasn't gone into round the clock special coverage [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=522.26s)]
*  quote media executives need not fret about being the boy who cried wolf. The [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=526.98s)]
*  wolf is now in the barn and mauling the livestock. The Democrats in the media [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=531.78s)]
*  have never seen a president execute a mandate with speed and precision. The [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=537.26s)]
*  country voted for change and we're watching representative government in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=541.74s)]
*  the 21st century. The feds they call that war. Nobody wants to work in this [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=546.06s)]
*  type of condition where we're going to be in a psychological warfare for how [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=552.66s)]
*  long. Other federal workers not revealing their names because of concern [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=557.3399999999999s)]
*  over retribution described to NBC News fear and panic and Orwellian nightmare. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=561.6999999999999s)]
*  Federal workers are worried about payback and psychological warfare. How [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  do you think the whole country's felt for the last 20 years? Having to tip toe [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=573.5s)]
*  around D.E.I. hauled into H.R. for jokes canceled for an opinion watching Black [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=578.2199999999999s)]
*  Lives Matter light us on fire. A guy wearing a dress raped a girl in the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=585.06s)]
*  girls bathroom and the girls dad got arrested for raising his voice. A D.E.I. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=590.9s)]
*  bureaucrat at the Department of Justice making six figures who's going to get a [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=596.42s)]
*  buyout with an eight month severage deal. They're not a victim. CNN is putting [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  spot shadows on feds like their lives are in danger. What is the general [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=606.18s)]
*  feeling across government amongst your fellow federal workers right now? Grief [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=612.18s)]
*  or angry? Many that are confused, but all kind of grieving in their own way. How [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  does it feel to be targeted for the work that you're so passionate about? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  It's okay. You could take your time. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  Uh, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=637.02s)]
*  it actually makes me proud of the people that I've worked with and the things [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=639.42s)]
*  that we've done. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=642.5799999999999s)]
*  CNN spot chatting a woman who's worked from home and now she's crying because [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=644.62s)]
*  she doesn't want to go back to the office. This is insane. CNN just laid [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=650.0999999999999s)]

*  Trump's agenda. They're surprised he's able to execute it because after years [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=843.62s)]
*  of incompetence, no one thought anyone was capable of doing anything in [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=847.6600000000001s)]

*  One of the things I remember from the PayPal days was that you know who [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=856.5s)]
*  complains the loudest is the fraudsters. Okay, so like the so when somebody was [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=860.06s)]
*  trying to come to Florida PayPal, we would see the most amount of righteous [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=868.26s)]
*  indignation like it would be like immediate over the top righteous [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=872.66s)]
*  indignation was from the fraudsters, not from honest people. Because honest [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=876.54s)]
*  people are like, Oh, I think there's something wrong with my account. I guess [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=881.5799999999999s)]
*  I wonder what's wrong. Let me inquire. And the fraudsters will come at you [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=884.06s)]
*  immediately. This is like it's like it's like a tell you that someone's actually [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=887.66s)]
*  doing fraud because the level of sort of faux outrage is way over the top. Elon [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=892.78s)]
*  doesn't care about bad press. He's trying to save the republic. It's good [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=898.42s)]
*  cop, bad cop. Trump's the good cop. He's the bad cop. We're catching them left [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=902.54s)]
*  and right. We're catching them. We're catching him to a point where they [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=908.18s)]
*  don't know what the heck is going on. They can't believe they're getting [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=911.98s)]
*  caught and have great respect for the people that are doing it. Elon Musk is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=915.22s)]
*  helping us on it. He's pretty good. He's pretty good. The government's been [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=920.1s)]
*  robbing us blind. We've been writing checks, six million for tourism in Egypt. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=926.1s)]
*  Like Egypt needs help with that. They have the pyramids. We should be spending [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=932.42s)]
*  money on cleaning up California so that tourists can vacation in California. Two [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=937.14s)]
*  million to help the BBC value the diversity of Libyan society. We're bribing [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=942.66s)]
*  the BBC to cover Libya better. Why? A million for a gay group in Armenia. There [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=949.98s)]
*  it is. We paid 20 million for Iraqi Sesame Street. Welcome to Henany and the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=956.5s)]
*  Trump White House is off to a lightning start fast. Don't blink. You probably [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=962.86s)]
*  will miss a massive development. In fact, no one in the state run legacy media [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=967.18s)]
*  mob or the Democratic Party, they can't really keep up with the speed of Donald [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=972.1s)]
*  Trump. They just know how to feign outrage every second of every day. That's [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=976.7s)]
*  that's all they know. Now there have been dozens of critical executive orders, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=981.98s)]
*  diplomacy all over the globe, confirmations across the board, including [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=987.1400000000001s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will join us in just a moment for her first [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=991.74s)]
*  interview as attorney general. We have also witnessed a multi front effort to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=995.86s)]
*  demolish woke politics, restore integrity and fairness at every federal institution. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1000.1s)]
*  But perhaps President Trump's most consequential action was tapping Elon [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1006.3000000000001s)]
*  Musk to lead the brand new Department of Government Efficiency or Doge for [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1011.3s)]
*  short. Now, according to Democrats and their friends in the legacy media mob, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1015.6999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk, he's a dangerous man with bad intentions and not an elected [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1020.66s)]
*  billionaire who's looking out for himself. One Democrat even suggesting he [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1025.7s)]
*  wants your money. Trust me, Elon doesn't want or need your money. He's got [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1030.3s)]
*  plenty. So tonight we're gonna set the record straight. Elon Musk is the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1035.1399999999999s)]
*  richest man in the world, and there's a reason he's brilliant. He's a self made [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1040.1s)]
*  billionaire, a first generation immigrant from South Africa. He embodies all [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1044.34s)]
*  things that are the American dream. Whether you realize it or not, your life [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1049.1s)]
*  has been impacted by Elon Musk. He helped to revolutionize electronic banking [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1053.54s)]
*  with PayPal. He created a new form of high speed Internet using low orbit [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1058.4599999999998s)]
*  satellites, making fast, reliable Internet accessible anywhere on Earth. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1063.5s)]
*  Pretty amazing. Musk even rushed Starlink terminals, you might recall, to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1068.86s)]
*  North Carolina, Tennessee, after Hurricane Helene, providing the only [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1073.3s)]
*  form of communication in that emergency in the aftermath. And he did the same [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1077.54s)]
*  for the people of California after the wildfires. Musk also reinvented space [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1082.3s)]
*  travel. It's called SpaceX. And soon, probably within the next month or so, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1086.9399999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk will literally be having, well, be rescuing astronauts. But he's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1091.3799999999999s)]

*  spearheaded the development of affordable, high performance electric [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1110.1399999999999s)]
*  vehicles through Tesla, which you kind of think, you know, Green New Deal [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1114.46s)]
*  Democrats, they'd love electric vehicles. Apparently not because he supports [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1119.1399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump. But that's not all. Through Tesla, he has also transformed [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1123.86s)]
*  American manufacturing. There's also Musk is life altering Neuralink, the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1128.74s)]
*  boring company that could one day solve all our traffic problems. He's also [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1134.1399999999999s)]
*  provided real freedom of speech on X and so much more. I mean, the guy is a [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1139.74s)]

*  And the truth is, Musk doesn't need to work for free for Donald Trump and the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1148.82s)]
*  federal government and the American people. He doesn't have to work another [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1152.98s)]

*  lift a finger. As Donald Trump would say, he could be on a tropical beach [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1160.6200000000001s)]

*  when they should have won in the category of fiction, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1961.46s)]
*  Trump sued not the paper, but the Pulitzer or Pulitzer. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1964.54s)]
*  Who gives a f***? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1968.78s)]
*  Now, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1970.5s)]
*  Trump wasn't looking for money. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1974.3s)]
*  What he really wanted is to show that the award committee and their media were in [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1975.98s)]
*  bed together like Anna Navarro and a tub of whipped Velveeta. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1980.26s)]
*  For example, Washington post columnist, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1987.54s)]
*  Eugene Robinson chaired the same committee that gave his own paper, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=1989.34s)]

*  but it wasn't just Robinson. According to the Washington free beacon, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2001.6999999999998s)]
*  journalists and execs from the New York times and PR Bloomberg USA Today also [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2005.22s)]

*  which is coincidentally my nickname for Jay Pritzker. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2013.58s)]
*  So yesterday Trump won a major victory. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2016.22s)]
*  A judge found enough for the case to go forward, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2017.78s)]

*  meaning all the emails about the Russia gate stories could get exposed. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2022.9s)]

*  it was a bigger sham than Elizabeth Warren's collection of Tomahawks. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2029.14s)]

*  Did it work? Well, Kamala isn't president, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2140.2599999999998s)]
*  but you can't say they didn't try. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2143.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump just settled with ABC News for 15 mil. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2146.38s)]

*  Trump also sued the Des Moines Register and veteran pollster Ann Seltzer for [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2161.1s)]
*  claiming Kamala was leading him in the Iowa polls. Makes sense. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2167.9s)]
*  We all knew that poll was nuttier than a d*** pic from Mr. Peanut. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2171.98s)]

*  And why? Well, the coup failed. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2242.94s)]
*  One thing we learned from Doge is that our government loves to create artificial [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2245.7s)]

*  If you are giving people the space to say you're not being truthful, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2433.98s)]

*  But they didn't want you to see that. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2472.54s)]
*  Adam, I have a challenge for you. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2480.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2482.54s)]
*  How can you turn Trump's recent success into a plethora of gross, dirty and [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2482.98s)]
*  disturbing jokes? Funny you should ask that, Greg. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2488.78s)]
*  But I look because of Trump, the media is being exposed more than Kanye's wife. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2493.5s)]
*  But there's one. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2499.82s)]
*  I mean, they bury the Russia hoax story, right? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2502.06s)]
*  But then they put out this story, which is like, I mean, that means [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  again, OK, they [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2510.18s)]
*  they bury the Hunter Biden story, but then they put out this story. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2512.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, like Hunter saw more cracked than Joy Behar's toilet seat. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2515.98s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2522.86s)]
*  They give an NRA, I mean, they basically the polls are prized to a fake news story. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2523.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's like the NRA giving a hunting award to Alec Baldwin. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2528.34s)]
*  You know, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2532.22s)]
*  it makes sense. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2535.5s)]
*  Or like Diddy winning the Teen Choice Awards. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2536.66s)]
*  You know, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2538.82s)]
*  he had his choice of teens. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2540.6600000000003s)]
*  Good point. Good point. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2542.6200000000003s)]
*  But I just like who gave him the award? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2543.82s)]
*  Like George Santos. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2545.54s)]
*  That was great. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2548.02s)]
*  Cat. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2553.42s)]
*  Cat, cat, what say you? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2557.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2560.6200000000003s)]
*  Isn't it funny, though? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2561.5s)]
*  We always knew the Pulitzer Prizes were bull. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2562.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2565.38s)]
*  Because we've never gotten one. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2566.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2568.22s)]
*  For the hard hitting journalism that is this show that that [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2571.14s)]
*  that expose we did on the Canadian shop [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2575.54s)]
*  teacher, the fake breasts, nobody was following that story except for us. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2578.74s)]
*  I would say it's actually even fair to say, except for you. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2583.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2586.42s)]
*  I was forced to follow it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2588.14s)]
*  Yes. By you. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2589.74s)]
*  Giant boob lady man. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2591.1s)]
*  Yeah, they're really just I think that they really are just two [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2594.54s)]
*  Americas. I think that there's people that haven't seen this. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2597.5s)]
*  And then there's people that will just point out only the more ridiculous [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2600.78s)]
*  aspects of Trump, his some of his losses, which there were ridiculous ones. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2604.1s)]
*  Of course, when he said CBS, he said the common interview cost him [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2609.1s)]
*  10 billion in damages, which is ridiculous. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2612.98s)]
*  Yeah. There's also people who obviously that interview, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2617.18s)]
*  you have to acknowledge, was edited in her favor. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2619.54s)]
*  If they were really sitting down and Trump was mumbling and stumbling like that, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2622.1s)]
*  they have cut that out. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2625.8999999999996s)]
*  I believe no. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2627.3799999999997s)]
*  But I think it's just we're in this media now where it's like, OK, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2629.74s)]
*  if you say something positive about Trump, then you're a Trump lackey. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2632.7s)]
*  If you say something negative about Trump and you're anti Trump, it's it's [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2635.7s)]
*  the more independent, uncut, unedited thought we can get out there. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2639.4199999999996s)]
*  I think that the better. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2643.4199999999996s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2646.7s)]
*  I don't. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2648.9399999999996s)]
*  I just thought I said I'd say I disagreed. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2650.3799999999997s)]
*  OK, we got to move on. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2652.62s)]
*  Up next, the NFL decides to yield over a phrase on the field. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqcy9ZF8bZU&t=2653.82s)]
