# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 4 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE)
*  Now, when the history of this campaign is written, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=0.0s)]
*  will it be Trump's victory, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=3.14s)]
*  the greatest political comeback of all time, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=5.24s)]
*  or will it be Harris won by hiding from the press [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=7.24s)]
*  and denying her record? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=10.44s)]
*  Well, just on the numbers alone, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  the race does seem very tight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=13.98s)]
*  The spread is a mere 2.2%, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=16.12s)]
*  with Harris at 49.1 to 46.9, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=18.62s)]
*  in real clear politics. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=21.88s)]
*  But the trends, and I love trends, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=23.52s)]
*  analyzing them is so much fun, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=25.52s)]
*  seem to be for MAGA momentum. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=26.92s)]
*  Important to note that 46.9% [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=29.92s)]
*  is the best Trump has ever performed nationally [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  at this point in the race. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=35.4s)]
*  Look at where he was in 2020 at the same point. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=37.5s)]
*  He was trailing Biden by 8.1%. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  And October 4th, 2016, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=44.14s)]
*  the RCP average had Trump behind Hillary by 5.8%. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  Of course, Trump went on to win. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  And even better news, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=52.24s)]
*  since the Electoral College is what matters, of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=53.88s)]
*  Trump is up ever so slightly by 0.1 [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  in the battleground state average. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=59.94s)]
*  Again, what really counts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=61.44s)]
*  And some insights from a few of the newest polls [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=63.64s)]
*  out there tonight, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=65.98s)]
*  pollster Scott Rasmussen with Napolitans News. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=66.88s)]
*  They also have the national race tied. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=70.28s)]
*  He surveyed almost 3,000 likely voters. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=72.38s)]
*  The hurricane response by the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=76.12s)]
*  that's certainly not gonna help them [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=78.7s)]
*  in either Georgia or North Carolina, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=80.06s)]
*  but there's a wrinkle to that, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=81.94s)]
*  and I'll get to that in a moment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=82.9s)]
*  Now, look, Americans know leadership when they see it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=85.16s)]
*  and Trump got to Georgia before either Biden or Harris did. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  And even the federal government, remember, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=92.6s)]
*  took just days for someone like an Elon Musk to get there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=95.9s)]
*  And he said he could restore internet service [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=101.82s)]
*  to most of the region if the government [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=103.92s)]
*  would just get out of the way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=105.32s)]
*  Of course, Musk would use Starlink. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=106.32s)]
*  He's ready and willing to do so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise that the betting markets [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=111.22s)]
*  have begun to move back toward Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  because of these factors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=115.77999999999999s)]
*  And the main reason that Trump still leads Kamala [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  on the most important issue to voters, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=120.28s)]
*  which is still the economy, because of high prices. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  People are making less money in real terms [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  than they were four years ago. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=127.66s)]
*  Most Americans, working class Americans, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  feel and are poorer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=131.9s)]
*  Now, I went to the grocery store today [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  to get a few things for my daughter, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=136.0s)]
*  who's coming home from college. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=137.74s)]
*  I almost fell over when I was checking out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=140.04s)]
*  Like, a box of cereal? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=144.0s)]
*  Like, cost $8? What? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  Like, for most families, this just is not sustainable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, even at this point, CNN cannot deny [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=151.88s)]
*  the right track, wrong track numbers. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  Just 28% of Americans think the U.S. is on the right track. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=158.72s)]
*  And I want you to put that in a perspective, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  When does the average, when the incumbent party [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  loses the election, look at that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=166.52s)]
*  It's just 25%. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  For me, is a bad sign for Kamala Harris's campaign. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=169.76s)]
*  The bottom line is, it looks a lot more like a loser [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=173.66s)]
*  than it does like a winner when it comes to the country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=176.56s)]
*  being on the right track. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  R-ro. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=181.06s)]
*  Well, this is why Harris and Biden were crowing today [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=182.66s)]
*  about the jobs numbers, trying to shift that momentum back to her. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=185.54s)]
*  254,000 new jobs created in September. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=189.04s)]
*  But I have to say this tonight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=192.78s)]
*  What do you think the chances are that those numbers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=194.98s)]
*  are going to be revised downward in a few months, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=197.22s)]
*  like all the other monthly gains were? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=199.56s)]
*  I'd say the chances are pretty high. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=202.1s)]
*  Second, dig into the data, and the picture is not great at all. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=204.0s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=209.38s)]
*  The numbers actually show that we lost 7,000 manufacturing jobs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  in the United States, and much of the growth is coming from, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  wait for it, government jobs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=219.12s)]
*  107,000 new ones since July. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  31,000 from August to September. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=223.62s)]
*  Thanks, Kamala. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  This is just what we need, more bureaucratic bloat. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=228.22s)]
*  And we know this as well, that most of the jobs [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  are going to foreign-born workers and illegal immigrants. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=234.66s)]
*  Over the last year, they've gained 1.2 million jobs, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=239.0s)]
*  while native-born workers dropped 825,000 jobs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=242.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, of course, Trump hit this today. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  You have illegals coming in and they're taking the jobs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=251.64s)]
*  And when you look at the numbers from that standpoint, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=255.32s)]
*  it's a shame. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=257.35999999999996s)]
*  We have to get the jobs of the people that have lived here [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  for a long time, and they're great, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  great citizens of our country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, none of this is great for American citizens. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=265.34s)]
*  Not good news at all. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  Bigger government, more illegals taking opportunities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=269.23999999999995s)]
*  So no wonder working-class union types are moving toward Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=272.58s)]
*  When unions that were historically endorsing Democrats [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=276.17999999999995s)]
*  are suddenly announcing that, well, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  we're staying on the sidelines this year, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=281.7s)]
*  we're not going to endorse anyone, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  well, that means one thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=285.44s)]
*  Their membership wants Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=287.02s)]
*  The International Association of Firefighters [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=290.6s)]
*  voted not to endorse any candidate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=292.62s)]
*  That's seen as a blow to Harris just weeks [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=294.6s)]
*  after the Teamsters Union did the same. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=296.66s)]
*  Of course, working-class Americans, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=299.8s)]
*  they watch as the federal government coddles illegals, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=301.24s)]
*  but craters life for everyone else. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=305.14s)]
*  And Hispanic voters, more of them are just fed up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=307.78s)]
*  A record number now supporting Trump in swing states [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=312.24s)]
*  like Arizona and Nevada. Key, key demographic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  Of course, Kamala's response to all this is no response at all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  We will not be gaslighted. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=324.3s)]
*  Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=327.38s)]
*  And he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=332.68s)]
*  But we know the facts and we know the truth. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=336.28s)]
*  Of course, the media is never going to fact check her claims. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=340.36s)]
*  Trump's policies brought strong wage growth [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  to blue collar workers, undeniable documented, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=346.58s)]
*  you know, read the data, Kamala. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=350.12s)]
*  At the end of 2019, inflation was under 2% [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  and gas was about $2.30 a gallon. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=355.06s)]
*  Well, I filled up my tank yesterday. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=358.56s)]
*  It was $4.63 a gallon, I took a photo. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=360.2s)]
*  82 bucks to fill my tank. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=364.2s)]
*  This is just totally unnecessary. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=366.6s)]
*  And it should make you furious every time you go to the pump, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  anytime you pay for anything these days. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=372.32s)]
*  So again, to review the economy, the border, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=374.76s)]
*  hurricane management, unrest in the Middle East, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  a stalemate at best in Ukraine, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  and then a Democrat ticket hiding from the press. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=383.55999999999995s)]
*  All these factors should make this an easy Trump win. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=386.94s)]
*  And the Democrats are obviously concerned. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  And they didn't really think, I don't think, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  that Wisconsin would be this close, but it is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=397.82s)]
*  Even liberal Tammy Baldwin's Senate seat [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  is not a sure thing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=403.68s)]
*  So in these final weeks of the campaign, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=406.12s)]
*  expect a blitz of appearances by the Obamas [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=407.72s)]
*  and other celebrities, the usual suspects. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  They're gonna be trying to whip up enthusiasm [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=414.1s)]
*  for four more years of a figurehead president. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  Because if you're out there and you think, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=420.5s)]
*  you know, Biden was so bad, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=422.04s)]
*  why on earth would you think Kamala would be any better? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=424.6s)]
*  She's just as inarticulate, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=427.94s)]
*  but less experienced and more irritating. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  For all these reasons, at least right now, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=433.98s)]
*  it seems like MAGA rising, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=436.66s)]
*  as America is ready to turn the page on a sad four years. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=438.96s)]
*  And that's the state of the race. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=443.6s)]
*  Today, Washington saw a ghost. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  Hey, folks. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=448.3s)]
*  My name's Joe Biden. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=451.8s)]
*  Welcome to the swimming pool. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=453.14s)]
*  Welcome, Mr. President. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=454.7s)]
*  We've been waiting for you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=455.7s)]
*  Welcome to the swimming pool. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  It was the first time Biden ever set foot [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  in the briefing room as president. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=461.02s)]
*  The press was stunned. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=462.82s)]
*  Peter Ducey's wig fell off. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=464.92s)]
*  And every channel in America cut straight to it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=467.32s)]
*  We were actually about to go live [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=471.02s)]
*  to Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=472.76s)]
*  who's speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=474.32s)]
*  And apparently she's talking about this port strike ending. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=477.26s)]
*  She's trying to appeal to union workers. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=480.54s)]
*  And yet you have the president of the United States [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=482.74s)]
*  come out clearly overshadowing her, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=484.6s)]
*  answering significant questions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that a communications mistake? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=489.3s)]
*  Is the left hand not talking to the right hand? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=491.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris was about to go on TV [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=493.88s)]
*  and take credit for ending the port strike. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=495.88s)]
*  And Biden looked and said, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=498.68s)]
*  Oh, no, you don't. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=500.12s)]
*  And big-footed her. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=501.68s)]
*  Biden wanted full credit. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=503.32s)]
*  He's a lame duck, but even lame ducks [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  care about their legacy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=507.56s)]
*  If you're the Harris campaign, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=509.56s)]
*  it's like Biden's haunting you from the grave. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=510.76s)]
*  Since the coup, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=513.56s)]
*  Biden hasn't left his room for 43 days. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  He's gone 43 days without anybody laying eyes on him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=518.66s)]
*  There's a ghost in the White House. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=522.5s)]
*  And in 15 minutes, that ghost spooked the Harris campaign. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=524.8s)]
*  I'm in constant contact with her. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=529.64s)]
*  She's aware we're singing from the same song sheet. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=531.54s)]
*  She helped pass all the laws that are being employed now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=535.5s)]
*  She was a major player in everything we've done, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=539.7399999999999s)]
*  including passage of legislation, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=543.5s)]
*  which we were told we could never pass. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=546.0999999999999s)]
*  And so she's been, and her staff is interlocked with mine [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  in terms of all the things we're doing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=554.24s)]
*  Biden just said Kamala's responsible [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=556.54s)]
*  for the last four years. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=558.64s)]
*  That is gonna hurt. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=561.04s)]
*  Seeing Biden again brought back memories. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=563.14s)]
*  Biden and the press were catching up [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=566.12s)]
*  on all of their favorite topics. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=568.2199999999999s)]
*  The election is a month away. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=570.42s)]
*  One, I'd like to know how you're feeling [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=572.18s)]
*  about how this election is going. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  And then also, do you have confidence [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=576.12s)]
*  that it will be a free and fair election [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=579.62s)]
*  and that it will be peaceful? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=582.16s)]
*  Two separate questions. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=585.06s)]
*  I'm confident it'll be free and fair. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=586.5s)]
*  I don't know whether it'll be peaceful. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=589.66s)]
*  The president of the United States should say, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=591.76s)]
*  this is gonna be a free and fair election, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=594.1999999999999s)]
*  and we have everything under control. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=596.74s)]
*  He shouldn't say, I don't know, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=599.38s)]
*  could get a little violent. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=601.72s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=603.76s)]
*  But it was time for Biden to leave. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=606.06s)]
*  The reporters asked him to get back in the race. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=608.16s)]
*  Do you want to reconsider dropping out of the race? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=612.1s)]
*  I'm back in. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=615.54s)]
*  It's actually funny, but the reporters [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=616.64s)]
*  see the same poll numbers we do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=621.08s)]
*  Biden might have a better shot, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=623.28s)]
*  and he still thinks he can win. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=625.92s)]
*  Biden, deep down, wants Kamala to lose. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  First Lady Jill Biden isn't on the campaign trail with Kamala. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=633.1400000000001s)]
*  Biden's not on the campaign trail with Kamala. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  He's actually hurting her campaign, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=639.88s)]
*  saying she co-signed all of his economic policies [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=642.22s)]
*  and then kicking her off TV [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=645.38s)]
*  so she couldn't get credit for the port deal. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=646.88s)]
*  If Kamala Harris loses, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=649.86s)]
*  Biden will blame one guy, Barack Obama. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=651.32s)]
*  This would be the second time Barack forced Joe out [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=656.8s)]
*  in 2016 for Hillary and 2024 for Harris, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=659.74s)]
*  with Trump beating them both times. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=663.48s)]
*  If Biden sees Kamala go down, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  he'll look at Barry and say, I told you so. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  That's if they're even talking, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=672.58s)]
*  because they're not talking right now. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=673.78s)]
*  But someone's going to be doing a lot of talking. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=675.88s)]
*  That's Barack. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=678.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris's internal poll numbers must be so bad. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  They're making the Messiah leave Hawaii [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=683.86s)]
*  to hit the trail for the home stretch. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=686.5s)]
*  President Obama, they are calling on him [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=689.08s)]
*  to go to Pittsburgh next week [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=691.52s)]
*  as they lean on his star power to turn out the vote, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=693.12s)]
*  his star power among Democrats, at least. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  And we have seen this to great effect [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=699.32s)]
*  in several last election cycles, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=702.5s)]
*  where Obama is sort of called in in the final hour [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=704.6s)]
*  in order to thwart Democratic complacency. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama's having second thoughts [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=711.44s)]

*  illegal immigrants. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1154.62s)]

*  to install Starlink service to the area a year ago. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1272.24s)]
*  It would have provided that service [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1276.08s)]

*  and take another look and get to work. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1465.0s)]
*  Or maybe FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1466.74s)]
*  designed to help Americans in emergency situations, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  maybe they should be focused on emergency management, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1475.24s)]
*  not illegal immigration, not on DEI and equity, which [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1479.3200000000002s)]
*  is a big part of their, quote, mission in writing. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1483.5200000000002s)]
*  If you look at FEMA's strategic plan, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1486.34s)]
*  instilling equity is the number one goal [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1488.94s)]
*  stated in the agency's official strategic plan. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1491.12s)]
*  What is equity doing right now to save lives in North Carolina [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1496.56s)]
*  and Georgia? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1499.72s)]
*  What is it doing? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1500.76s)]
*  What is equity doing to rebuild roads and bridges [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1502.0s)]
*  and give people food and water and shelter? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1504.6s)]
*  What is equity doing to get people the things that they [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1507.4s)]
*  need, the time, the energy, the taxpayer money that FEMA wasted [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1510.34s)]
*  on left-wing political obsessions [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1514.9199999999998s)]
*  is an absolute disgrace. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1517.3s)]
*  Taking money for Americans and giving it [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1519.1999999999998s)]
*  to their illegal immigrants that they are obsessed with, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1522.1999999999998s)]
*  it is unconscionable. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1525.74s)]
*  It is soulless. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1527.0s)]
*  It is heartless. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1528.34s)]
*  It's no wonder the response has been an utter disaster. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1529.6999999999998s)]
*  And today, while Kamala campaigned in Michigan, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1533.54s)]
*  Donald Trump, he was back on the ground. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1536.28s)]
*  He was touring the hurricane damage in Georgia [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1538.4599999999998s)]
*  with Governor Brian Kemp, who said [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1541.26s)]
*  he had to go back to the federal government three times. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  He wanted 90 counties declared a disaster area. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1546.3799999999999s)]
*  He got 11. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1549.78s)]
*  Then he went back. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  Then they gave him 30. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1551.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think finally they stepped up today [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1553.02s)]
*  after he had to make multiple calls to get the help he needed. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1555.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1558.96s)]
*  First of all, just say thank you so much for joining us [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1560.32s)]
*  as we continue to work day and night to recover [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1563.1599999999999s)]
*  from this historic but also horrific storm. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1565.76s)]
*  I want to thank you for keeping the nation's attention [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1569.76s)]
*  on those who are hurting in Georgia. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1572.78s)]
*  And I certainly appreciate President Trump [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1574.82s)]
*  helping us do that as well. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1577.26s)]
*  Brian, thank you very much. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1579.16s)]
*  Your governor is doing a fantastic job, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1580.3600000000001s)]
*  I will tell you that. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1582.6000000000001s)]
*  And we're all with him and with everybody. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1583.6000000000001s)]
*  We've just met a group of really wonderful patriots [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1587.2s)]
*  that are working very hard. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1590.68s)]
*  They've done it before, but they told me [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1592.38s)]
*  they've never seen one like this. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1593.78s)]
*  I'm not thinking about voters right now. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1595.14s)]
*  I'm thinking about lives. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1596.72s)]
*  And to be honest, it's much bigger than anything else. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1597.98s)]
*  But we're thinking about lives. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1602.26s)]
*  A lot of lives lost, a lot of people missing. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1603.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's what I'd be focused on right now. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1606.04s)]
*  Now, there's a famous saying that a big part of success [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1608.94s)]
*  is just showing up. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1611.38s)]
*  But tonight, Kamala, Joe, there's nowhere to be found. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1612.64s)]
*  And sadly, this isn't the only crisis that is festering [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1615.3200000000002s)]
*  under Biden and Harris. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1618.78s)]
*  Tonight, the Middle East is on the verge of an all-out war. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1619.98s)]
*  Our closest ally, Israel, in the region, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1623.72s)]
*  attacked by Iran with a barrage of intercontinental ballistic [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1626.8600000000001s)]
*  missiles. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1631.24s)]
*  And it's only a matter of time, by the way, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1632.5400000000002s)]
*  before Israel must respond. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  And of course, then comes the pressure from Joe and Kamala [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1636.38s)]
*  to appease the Iranians. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1639.46s)]
*  They were the ones that made Iran rich. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1641.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala is also facing a personal scandal [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  tonight, breaking this week a new Daily Mail report [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1646.8200000000002s)]
*  outlining shocking allegations against Kamala's husband, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1650.1000000000001s)]
*  the second gentleman, Dougie. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1654.4s)]
*  According to the report, he is accused [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1656.5s)]
*  of forcefully slapping his ex-girlfriend in 2012 [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1659.02s)]
*  for flirting with another man while at the Cannes Film [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1662.16s)]
*  Festival event in France. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1665.56s)]
*  Now, we've not independently verified the claims allegedly [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1667.52s)]
*  made by three of the women's friends to the Daily Mail. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1671.0s)]
*  And the outlet also never spoke with the alleged victim. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1674.3400000000001s)]
*  And well, Doug Emhoff's representative [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1677.54s)]
*  gave a statement for Semaphore denying all allegations. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1681.18s)]
*  We also reached out for a statement. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1685.42s)]
*  And I've not heard back. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  We will continue to monitor that story. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1688.32s)]
*  Now, this allegation comes after he [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1690.62s)]
*  was forced to admit that he impregnated his kid's teacher [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1692.5s)]
*  while married to his first wife. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1696.66s)]
*  OK, if it was a Trump allegation, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1698.7s)]
*  you'd think the media would be all over it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1701.74s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DbGuwwoqE&t=1704.2s)]
