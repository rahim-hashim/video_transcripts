# Fox News Highlights - July 9th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8)
*  Democrats unmasked. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=0.0s)]
*  Now you can't really make this up. Once again, Democrats seem to be obsessed with punishing law enforcement officers, in this case those working for ICE. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=7.0s)]
*  Senators Alex Padilla and Cory Booker are pushing a bill that would force agents to remove face coverings and display names and badge numbers in the middle of raids. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=18.0s)]
*  The importance and the urgency because of not just fear, Jen, but actual terror that people are feeling, not just in Los Angeles, but especially in Los Angeles because it's clearly Donald Trump's target right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=30.0s)]
*  Now they claim this effort is a call for transparency and accountability. Bull. President Trump, he's calling him out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=44.0s)]
*  They wouldn't be saying that if they didn't hate our country, and they obviously do, I'm surprised that they would do it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=52.0s)]
*  You put them in great danger, tremendous danger, and it's sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard, and they have masks on, more than masks, I mean you can't see anything. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=60.0s)]
*  Nobody complains about that. But when a patriot who works for ICE or Border Patrol puts a mask on so that they won't recognize him and his family, so they can lead a little bit of a normal life after having worked so hard and so dangerously, there's a problem with that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=72.0s)]
*  Of course, he's totally right. Democrats want to unmask ICE for a few simple reasons. First of all, because they don't want the laws enforced and they want to make it harder to recruit new ICE agents. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=94.0s)]
*  But here's a simple truth. Again, Democrats are more interested in punishing the 77 million Americans who voted for Trump than they are in punishing criminals. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=108.0s)]
*  They don't seem very worried, do they, about the Mexican drug cartel, South American gangs, or other illegal alien criminals? Because to liberals, they're not illegal at all, not really. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=119.0s)]
*  Let's just call them undocumented Democrats. And now that our government is actually doing the will of the people, rounding up the illegal, starting to deport them from the United States, Democrats, rather than cheering thank God for law and order, are crying foul. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=131.0s)]
*  And they want our agents exposed, just as lunatics are taking aim at them. Attacks on ICE are skyrocketing. A normal person would condemn this kind of violence. But not Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=147.0s)]
*  One House Democrat saying, quote, and I'll read it to you, our own base is telling us that what we're doing is not good enough. There needs to be blood to grab the attention of the press and the public. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=159.0s)]
*  How do you respond to that, leader Jeffries? Are Democrats not meeting the moment, not doing enough to fight these developments? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=171.0s)]
*  Well, we are in a more is more environment in terms of the unprecedented assault on the American way of life and our country that has been launched by Donald Trump and compliant House Republicans. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=179.0s)]
*  OK, maybe Hakeem hasn't heard. But in the last week, there was not one, but there were two ambushes on immigration officers in Texas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=192.0s)]
*  The suspect in McAllen was shot dead after he sprayed a Border Patrol annex with rifle fire, wounding three people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=202.0s)]
*  And in Alvarado, 10 massed radicals in full tactical gear were apprehended after unloading 20 to 30 rounds from AR style rifles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=209.0s)]
*  That happened at DHS and police officers. Those freaks are now facing attempted murder and terrorism charges. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=218.0s)]
*  I think you have some very stupid people in the left who have some money that are making it available to these people because you look at the guns they had. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=225.0s)]
*  They were brand new. You look at even the clothing they were wearing. It looked like it just came out of some military shop. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=232.0s)]
*  So you have some very stupid people that if anything ever happened, they'd be the first to go. They don't understand that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=239.0s)]
*  They'd be the first to go. They'd be the first ones hit. But they are there is money being put behind people when you look at the weapons they have. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=246.0s)]
*  The newness of the weapons, rifles that just came out and they have the latest model. So there's something going on and we'll get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=255.0s)]
*  Trump's hitting at something. He's also on to something. In California, four were arrested after allegedly using homemade tire spikes to damage Border Patrol vehicles. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=264.0s)]
*  Now, when they were caught, and this is the rub, they were found with even more tire spikes carried inside a bag with the acronym CHIRLA, C-H-I-R-L-A branding on it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=275.0s)]
*  Now, CHIRLA, I've talked about this before on the angle, stands for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=286.0s)]
*  It's an anti-ice activist network in L.A. And it has received $34 million in federal grants. Isn't this great? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=293.0s)]
*  Now, we don't know if there's a connection, but CHIRLA is being investigated by Congress for potential ties to the anti-ice riots, obviously that turned violent. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=304.0s)]
*  So is it any wonder with all of this swirling around, imagine being an ICE agent today, that our ICE agents mask up? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=313.0s)]
*  The left's doxing machine never sleeps after all. Some agents and their families say that they've been doxed so often that many now fear even walking their kids to school unless they're wearing face coverings. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=321.0s)]
*  Of course, Democrats, they loved masks. I mean, we covered it on the angle for years. During COVID, they loved them. They demanded them even on toddlers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=334.0s)]
*  Remember that? Your two-year-old has to wear a mask. Now, they're fine when looters wear masks to conceal their identities, pulling the Louis Vuitton off the shelves. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=342.0s)]
*  And Democrats wouldn't think of passing laws, banning face masks at any of the protests. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=351.0s)]
*  You know, funny how masks were a First Amendment right for the BLM rioters, for the Hamas cheerleaders, and abolish ICE mobs, but suddenly dangerous when they're worn by people arresting child predators. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=357.0s)]
*  Individuals like Alvaro de Jesus Martinez Juarez, convicted child sex predator, deported to Guatemala just last week. Thank you, ICE. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=369.0s)]
*  Or this gem, Javier Zeledon Reyes, who admitted massacring 20 people in Nicaragua, and he's linked to a Mexican cartel now deported. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=378.0s)]
*  These are the victims, victims that Democrats think deserve to see the faces of the agents that thankfully arrest them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=390.0s)]
*  So unmask ICE? How about we unmask the real motives of Senators Padilla, Booker, and all their progressive pals? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=399.0s)]
*  Their motives to scare agents into silence and to hamstring law enforcement. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=409.0s)]
*  Until Democrats get back into power, this is what they're hoping. They intimidate all the agents, they hurt recruiting of agents, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=415.0s)]
*  and then once they get back into power, they'll fling open the border once again to more freeloaders, gang bangers, drug pushers, and of course just run-of-the-mill violent criminals. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=422.0s)]
*  But here's my prediction tonight. As Democrats' true motives and all their obvious hypocrisy become clear, more Americans will turn to the America First movement, including legal immigrants, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=431.0s)]
*  because it's the only sane option for our very survival. And that's the angle. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=444.0s)]
*  But millions of bad hombres waltzed across our border with no vetting, then gave them bus tickets and flew them all across the country. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=452.0s)]
*  If you said the word invasion, they called you racist. And now that Trump's giving these guys the boot, Democrats have finally decided there is an invasion, just a different kind. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=459.0s)]
*  So they've been trying to tell us, Republicans, that the invasion is coming from south of the border. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=471.0s)]
*  It would seem that the invasion into American cities is coming from law enforcement deployed by this administration to terrorize communities. Am I getting that right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=477.0s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. This president has unleashed a war on our own people and our communities. It is terrorizing our communities. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=490.0s)]
*  If men can be women and Liz Warren can be Indian, deportations can be invasions. Why not? It's starting to escalate. Democrats are calling ICE Nazis, and now Donald Trump's the terrorist in chief. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=497.0s)]
*  Not just fear, Jen, but actual terror that people are feeling, not just in Los Angeles, but especially in Los Angeles, because that's clearly Donald Trump's target right now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=512.0s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump wants. He wants a theatrics. He wants to send the message and escalate the terror that people are feeling. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=523.0s)]
*  Socialist sleeper cells heard the call and are reporting for duty. One guy just got arrested for threatening to kill Trump, Pan Bondi, and Stephen Miller. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=530.0s)]
*  And if you want to get to Miller, you got to go through me first. Now that Kyle Jihadi's are out for school for the summer, they've moved on from defending Hamas to Jose. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=541.0s)]
*  A battalion of icebreakers tried to overpower agents outside an immigration court in San Francisco. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=551.0s)]
*  Blue haired cat ladies are on the loose too, and they're Bridget McCroning ICE agents in broad daylight. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=582.0s)]
*  Idiot, not replying, and the moment I hear something, I'm going to go and see you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=590.0s)]
*  Now in case you need a reminder about who these protesters are fighting for, this guy just got iced in Nebraska just this morning. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=598.0s)]
*  An MS-13 kingpin. He's wanted in El Salvador for five homicides and is on that country's most wanted list. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=606.0s)]
*  Would Democrats prefer a guy wanted for five homicides to keep hanging out in Omaha? Seems like it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=614.0s)]
*  Because yesterday, anarchists tried blowing out the tires of a border patrol vehicle in California. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=621.0s)]
*  They got handcuffed, and now we have the mugshots. Ladies, feast your eyes on that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=627.0s)]
*  And get this, remember we told you about that crew that ambushed ICE in tactical gear? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=633.0s)]
*  One of the attackers' husbands, Biden, gave him a green card. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=638.0s)]
*  And now he's been arrested for tampering with evidence while feds were serving a search warrant. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=643.0s)]
*  Trump says he's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=648.0s)]
*  47 says it doesn't matter who you are. If you attack our agents, we'll find you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=668.0s)]
*  Do you think that this was an isolated incident, or do you think there's a national threat of a left-wing militia that is targeting ICE and CBP? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=683.0s)]
*  Well, I think you have some very stupid people in the left who have some money that are making it available to these people. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=693.0s)]
*  Because you look at the guns they had, they were brand new. You look at even the clothing they were wearing, it looked like it just came out of some military shop. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=699.0s)]
*  So you have some very stupid people that if anything ever happened, they'd be the first to go. We'll get to the bottom of it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=707.0s)]
*  Some ICE agents are choosing to wear masks because they're getting filmed by cartels and Trantifa while they're just doing their duty. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=715.0s)]
*  And their families are getting doxxed, and they're getting death threats. But Eric Swalwell thinks ICE agents are cowards. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=723.0s)]
*  He says real men don't hide their faces. Well then, Swalwell's not a real man because he hid his face for two years, which in a way we appreciate. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=730.0s)]
*  Democrats finally found a mask they don't like, and now they're trying to pass a bill that prevents law enforcement from keeping their identities and their families safe. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=741.0s)]
*  Trump was asked about this today. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=751.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be saying that if they didn't hate our country. You put them in great danger, tremendous danger. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=753.0s)]
*  And it's sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard, and they have masks on, more than masks. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=762.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't see anything. Nobody complains about that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=769.0s)]
*  But when a patriot who works for ICE or Border Patrol puts a mask on so that they won't recognize him and his family, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=772.0s)]
*  so they can lead a little bit of a normal life after having worked so hard and so dangerously. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=784.0s)]
*  Democrat voters are out for blood, and they want their elected leaders to do the same. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=790.0s)]
*  Hips don't lie, Hakim, refusing to tell his own people to stand down. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=795.0s)]
*  One House Democrat saying, quote, and I'll read it to you, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=800.0s)]
*  Our own base is telling us that what we're doing is not good enough. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=803.0s)]
*  There needs to be blood to grab the attention of the press and the public. How do you respond to that? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=808.0s)]
*  Well, we are in a more is more environment in terms of the unprecedented assault on the American way of life [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=814.0s)]
*  and our country that has been launched by Donald Trump and compliant House Republicans. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=820.0s)]
*  So after January 6, Democrats told every Republican condemn. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=825.0s)]
*  But now that their people are trying to kill federal agents in cold blood, silent. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=830.0s)]
*  John Fetterman, he might be the only person on that side of the aisle who backs the blue. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=835.0s)]
*  Absolutely unacceptable, terrible, awful. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=840.0s)]
*  I think ICE agents are just doing their job and I fully support that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=846.0s)]
*  And for me and people in my party might, you know, want to abolish it or treat them as criminals or anything. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=853.0s)]
*  That's that's inappropriate and outrageous. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=863.0s)]
*  ICE performs an important an important job for our nation. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=866.0s)]
*  Violent illegals are off the streets, but Karen's begging the courts to bring them back. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=873.0s)]
*  We have to stop this mess. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=879.0s)]
*  You know, the idea of having troops go through the park and disrupt the children's summer camp or drive through the streets and just pick people off the streets. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=881.0s)]
*  We don't know if the kidnapping is happening or what. And so our city attorney is leading the way. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=890.0s)]
*  We're filing a lawsuit. We're calling for an injunction for this to stop. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=895.0s)]
*  I'm clear about my job, which is to make sure that this city is safe for all Angelenos, regardless of when you came here, what country you came from or why. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=899.0s)]
*  Karen was knocking back cocktails in Africa while her city burned. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=909.0s)]
*  And then six months later, she let it burn again. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=913.0s)]
*  She's not keeping her city safe. She's keeping it safe for MS-13. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=916.0s)]
*  And the park, ICE rated, there's no summer camp there. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=920.0s)]
*  Look at it. That's a park that it's like a trend day on a playground. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=924.0s)]
*  It's riddled with needles, junkies. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=929.0s)]
*  She should thank ICE for cleaning that mess up. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=932.0s)]
*  And she should thank Trump for what he's doing with the traffic. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=935.0s)]
*  Illegals are so scared of getting iced in L.A. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=939.0s)]
*  They're all hiding or self-deporting. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=942.0s)]
*  The freeways wide open, we're hearing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=944.0s)]
*  It's not bumper to bumper as much on the 405 anymore. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=946.0s)]
*  At least that's what sources are telling Primetime. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=950.0s)]
*  Trump's doing what he was elected to do, and he's not going to stop anytime soon. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=952.0s)]
*  The only thing Democrats want more than cheap labor is to get their own mugshots. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=957.0s)]
*  And now some are practically begging to be deported. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=962.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. They are not going after criminals. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=965.0s)]
*  They're going after anybody that is brown, that looks like me, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=968.0s)]
*  that can't pass as what they say is a typical American. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=972.0s)]
*  That's why you're getting people who are not undocumented actually arrested. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=976.0s)]
*  That's the fear that exists. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=981.0s)]
*  If Trump was going after brown skin, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=983.0s)]
*  wouldn't we have heard of one American wrongfully deported, just one? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=986.0s)]
*  It's July. There's a lot of brown out there. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=991.0s)]
*  So far, Homan's batting 1,000. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=994.0s)]
*  Jails are filling up fast, and alligator Alcatraz has its first inmates. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=997.0s)]
*  And like most inmates, they're not happy. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1002.0s)]
*  All three detainees told their wives that the bugs were getting inside. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1006.0s)]
*  One of them saying that grasshoppers the size of his hand were springing into the tent. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1011.0s)]
*  One detainee sent alligator Alcatraz from a Florida jail following a dispute with his ex [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1016.0s)]
*  was bitten on his face by mosquitoes a few times in his sleep. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1022.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. I can't believe an illegal got a mosquito bite. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1027.0s)]
*  He's surrounded by alligators. He should be happy that's the only bite he got. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1032.0s)]
*  It's not as bad as Abu Ghraib, okay? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1037.0s)]
*  The migrants also complained the tents were a little too nippy. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1040.0s)]
*  They might be the only people in Florida saying they're too cold. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1044.0s)]
*  And while the illegals might need a couple of fly swatters and an extra blanket, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1048.0s)]
*  the left is saying this is straight out of Nazi Germany. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1052.0s)]
*  We are normalizing a government agency disappearing people. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1056.0s)]
*  We are normalizing. We're talking about it like it's no big deal that they are kidnapping people [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1060.0s)]
*  and transporting them to concentration camps, both domestic and foreign. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1065.0s)]
*  It's disgusting behavior. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1069.0s)]
*  It's not a death camp. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1071.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It's a concentration camp what they're doing. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1073.0s)]
*  And they are disappearing people claiming that these are people who have committed the most harsh crimes. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1075.0s)]
*  But according to the reporting, less than 10% of these people have committed harsh crimes. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1079.0s)]
*  You know who else gets disappeared? Americans who commit crimes and go to jail. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1083.0s)]
*  Remember when they tried to disappear Trump? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1088.0s)]
*  That sure came back to bite. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1092.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1094.0s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1098.0s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1102.0s)]
*  All right. All right. All right. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1106.0s)]
*  I expect a standing ovation. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1108.0s)]
*  Even you in the wheelchair. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1111.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1113.0s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and get you a little bit of a break. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1115.0s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and get you a little bit of a break. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1117.0s)]
*  I expect a standing ovation. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1119.0s)]
*  Even you in the wheelchair. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1121.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1123.0s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1125.0s)]
*  So Stacey Abrams went on Jimmy Kimmel and outlined 10 steps that Trump will take to cancel the next election. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1127.0s)]
*  Yes, 10 steps, which is seven more that she can take without needing an oxygen mask. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1133.0s)]
*  Or a hot dog. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1142.0s)]
*  Thanks to a new book, while in the White House, Joe Biden always encouraged her husband to eat vegetables. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1145.0s)]
*  But wouldn't that make him a cannibal? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1151.0s)]
*  Thanks to a temporary increase in the Earth's rotation, today was the shortest day in history. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1157.0s)]
*  To make it feel longer, watch Fox News at eight. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1163.0s)]
*  Don't question the logic. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1170.0s)]
*  Whippy Goldberg told the View audience that, quote, sometimes this gig could feel like hell. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1173.0s)]
*  We still aren't sure whether she was speaking for her co-hosts or their chairs. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1180.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1187.0s)]
*  Usually those jokes hit really hard, but OK. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1188.0s)]
*  According to a new poll, more and more kids are being named after mass murderers. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1192.0s)]
*  True, there's been a surge in names such as Ted, Jeffrey, and of course, Hillary. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1197.0s)]
*  Gary Coleman's ex-wife failed a lie detector test, leaving many to believe she was involved in his death. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1207.0s)]
*  I know. I bet right now Gary is turning over in his shoe box. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1214.0s)]
*  If she goes to trial, it'll be at small claims court. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1222.0s)]
*  Although she still claims he died from having a different stroke. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1227.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1232.0s)]
*  He would have laughed. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1234.0s)]
*  The TSA is no longer requiring you to take off your shoes during security checks, which started because of the shoe bomber in 2001, causing one man to ask, why couldn't there have been a panty bomber? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1237.0s)]
*  These are good questions. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1250.0s)]
*  And finally, a Ronald McDonald statue was stolen from a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1251.0s)]
*  Turns out the thief thought they were kidnapping Kathy Griffin. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1256.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1261.0s)]
*  Not good. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1263.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1264.0s)]
*  Enough of that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1266.0s)]
*  So Team Trump is firing on all cylinders. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1268.0s)]
*  He's coupling unfiltered transparency with the fact that he's a big shot. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1271.0s)]
*  He's firing on all cylinders. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1276.0s)]
*  He's coupling unfiltered transparency with relentless action, which in D.C. is as rare as a disease free hooker. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1277.0s)]
*  And it doesn't hurt that the Supreme Court gave the go ahead for Trump's plan to make some much needed government cuts. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1286.0s)]
*  Because if there's any place that has extra fat to cut, it's Washington. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1292.0s)]
*  And this White House isn't just cleaning houses, it's taking out the trash. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1298.0s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about the furniture Joe Biden soiled. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1302.0s)]
*  Starting with criminal investigations of former CIA Director John Brennan and former CIA Director James Comey. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1306.0s)]
*  You know, the ones that pushed the fake Russian collusion story so they could drag Hillary into the White House by her cankles. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1313.0s)]
*  So transparency is winning out while sordid schemes get exposed. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1320.0s)]
*  And it's all happening while Trump lets the cameras roll. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1324.0s)]
*  He just held his sixth cabinet meeting. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1327.0s)]
*  It lasted one hour and 45 minutes. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1330.0s)]
*  That's longer than all nine of Biden's public cabinet meetings combined, which clocked in at a grand total of 58 minutes, which coincidentally is how long it takes Joe to open a beach chair. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1333.0s)]
*  But likely in a Caprio at a sorority mixer, Trump hit on just about everything. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1349.0s)]
*  For example, is there no amnesty for illegals? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1355.0s)]
*  There's no amnesty. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1359.0s)]
*  What we're doing is we're getting rid of criminals, but we are doing a work program. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1360.0s)]
*  We're going to give the farmers the people they need, but we're not talking amnesty. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1365.0s)]
*  He also called out that commie Zoran. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1370.0s)]
*  Did Trump used to say we will not ever be a socialist country? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1373.0s)]
*  I used to say we will not ever be a socialist country, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1378.0s)]
*  Well, I'll say it again. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1383.0s)]
*  We're not going to have if a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1385.0s)]
*  But we have tremendous power at the White House to run places when we have to. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1393.0s)]
*  We're going to do something for New York. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1398.0s)]
*  I can't tell you what yet, but we're going to make New York great again. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1400.0s)]
*  You know, maybe Trump should run for New York mayor when he's done with the whole president thing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1403.0s)]
*  Seriously, after all, it's time we replace Central Park with an enormous casino. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1408.0s)]
*  He also brought up Operation Midnight Hammer, which sounds like the name of the cologne I wore when I used to date Delta Burke. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1418.0s)]
*  But did those machines fly for 30 straight 37 straight hours? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1425.0s)]
*  Those machines flew for 37 straight hours. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1431.0s)]
*  Those machines flew for 37 straight hours. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1434.0s)]
*  They didn't stop. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1436.0s)]
*  They went skedaddle. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1438.0s)]
*  You know the word skedaddle? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1439.0s)]
*  I mean, skedaddle. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1440.0s)]
*  They dropped the bombs and somebody said skedaddle. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1442.0s)]
*  Let's get the hell out of here. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1445.0s)]
*  Skedaddle. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1447.0s)]
*  It's not a word you hear very often in military context, unless you're French. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1448.0s)]
*  And let's not forget the decor. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1455.0s)]
*  But I wonder, does Trump love the frame of those pictures? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1457.0s)]
*  I love the frame of those pictures. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1462.0s)]
*  Look at those frames. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1463.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a frame person. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1464.0s)]
*  Sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1465.0s)]
*  It's true, especially if they're pictures of Bigfoot. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1468.0s)]
*  But if sunlight is the best disinfected, boy, did it go dark when you bring up Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1473.0s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1482.0s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1485.0s)]
*  You're asking we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1487.0s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1492.0s)]
*  That is unbelievable. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1496.0s)]
*  Now when was the last time Trump declined to answer anything? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1499.0s)]
*  Seems like he really didn't want to talk about it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1503.0s)]
*  Look, I get it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1506.0s)]
*  There's national security issues, maybe even classified details. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1507.0s)]
*  But why does this piss us off? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1510.0s)]
*  It's time for... [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1513.0s)]
*  Now with 65% less body hair. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1522.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1525.0s)]
*  Now imagine as a kid for Christmas you ask for a beautiful red Schwinn stingray with a banana seat. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1527.0s)]
*  Christmas morning you unwrap it and the bike is everything you wanted. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1534.0s)]
*  But it's not red, it's yellow. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1538.0s)]
*  And so you cry and your parents plead, look, we did everything we could. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1540.0s)]
*  Your dad worked extra hours at the factory. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1544.0s)]
*  Your mom turned tricks at the wharf. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1546.0s)]
*  And granny, she became a drug mule for the Yakuza. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1551.0s)]
*  And yes, we were able to get that last bike at the toy store. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1555.0s)]
*  But this was the only color. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1559.0s)]
*  Well that's the Trump presidency. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1561.0s)]
*  You're going to get just about everything you want, but not everything. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1563.0s)]
*  But what's amazing about this White House is that everything is transparent, including even their cover-ups. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1568.0s)]
*  It's so obvious that there's more to this than they're letting on. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1574.0s)]
*  But they're letting us know that by doing a lousy job of covering it up. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1578.0s)]
*  I mean, remember Bonjena Patel in this clip? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1583.0s)]
*  As a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1586.0s)]
*  who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one and that's what that was. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1592.0s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1597.0s)]
*  Again, you want me to... I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1599.0s)]
*  Even Stevie Wonder wouldn't buy that body language. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1604.0s)]
*  Maybe their robotic dismissal is one collective wink. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1608.0s)]
*  But still, it might help to present the case to your voters. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1613.0s)]
*  Because if you don't tell us what's going on, we'll just imagine something worse. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1616.0s)]
*  That's why I'm encouraging Trace Gallagher to release his sex tape. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1621.0s)]
*  Because what's worse than total transparency? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1626.0s)]
*  Thinking that your guy might be involved. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1629.0s)]
*  Which is why you can't leave Epstein Island shrouded in fog. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1632.0s)]
*  Look, we're grateful for everything mentioned in that very long cabinet meeting. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1636.0s)]
*  But until we feel like we've gotten the answer on Epstein, no cabinet meeting will be long enough. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1640.0s)]
*  Let's welcome, Hedai Sketch. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1646.0s)]
*  He once had a threesome with Cagney and Lacey. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1651.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor Paul Morrow. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1655.0s)]
*  As a Columbia grad, she knows how to dodge a Molotov cocktail. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1659.0s)]
*  Staff writer for the free press, Olivia Reingold. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1663.0s)]
*  He just flew in from Alaska, and boy are his jokes tired. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1669.0s)]
*  Actor, writer, and comedian, Jamie Lissow. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1673.0s)]
*  And in a strange turn of events, her baby burps her. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1678.0s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, Fox News contributor, Captain. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1682.0s)]
*  Paul, you've been in law enforcement for decades. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1685.0s)]
*  I understand being disappointed in this stuff. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1689.0s)]
*  But I feel like they're telling us that there's more there, but we don't want to know about it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1693.0s)]
*  My guess is this is an Intel honeypot that involved other countries and our CIA. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1700.0s)]
*  And the more that we know about it, the uglier it is. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1705.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure that we're going to know about it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1708.0s)]
*  But I think that's the way it is. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1711.0s)]
*  And the more that we know about it, the uglier it is. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1713.0s)]
*  Well, all right. Let's say one thing. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1716.0s)]
*  First of all, relative to transparency, you've got to give Trump credit. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1718.0s)]
*  Because I know where this, more than I know where my wife is, I know at any point in any day where Donald Trump is. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1722.0s)]
*  It's like unbelievable. There's an app, literally, that you can follow the guy. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1730.0s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1734.0s)]
*  We might as well put an Apple tag on him. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1735.0s)]
*  And he's making the effort. So you've got to give him that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1738.0s)]
*  Now, I had to predicate it with that. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1741.0s)]
*  Look, if you take as a given the idea that Epstein was a sorcerer, right, he's some sort of an asset, which, look, you know, everybody knows the story. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1743.0s)]
*  The first time around when he got collared in Florida, the prosecutor said it's above my pay grade. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1751.0s)]
*  It's in the Intel world. I got to step off. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1756.0s)]
*  That's why he got the sweetheart deal. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1758.0s)]
*  Think about what I always did in intelligence circumstances is that put myself in the adversary's position. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1760.0s)]
*  And you have to say to yourself, if you are on Gino Patel, Trump, right. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1766.0s)]
*  And by the way, this is not a bungee know and Patel. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1771.0s)]
*  They work. People forget this. They work for Bondi. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1774.0s)]
*  Their stuff goes to Bondi. She's the decision maker here. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1777.0s)]
*  So we got to remember that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1780.0s)]
*  But that said, if you're sitting on stuff that you got from him and you get in there and you open up the books, now you're behind the curtain. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1781.0s)]
*  You got the clearance and you say, oh, look at this. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1788.0s)]
*  If you give it to the public, it's no longer valuable. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1791.0s)]
*  So my assumption here and I'm going to get destroyed for this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1796.0s)]
*  I know how the Internet is. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1801.0s)]
*  Number one, I'm telling you, I know enough about corrections. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1802.0s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1805.0s)]
*  This idea that an entire let him kill. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1806.0s)]
*  They let him kill himself. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1809.0s)]
*  I don't even give it that when the idea that somehow rather an entire shift in federal corrections colluded to stage a suicide, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1810.0s)]
*  you are vastly overriding what happens in the civil service. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1819.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1822.0s)]
*  Let me just tell you, it didn't go that way. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1825.0s)]
*  But that said, that's a red herring. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1828.0s)]
*  That's not what we should be focusing on. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1829.0s)]
*  We should be focusing on the investigation into him. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1831.0s)]
*  What is it we're not being told about the tapes, what they found at the search warrants and all that crap. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1834.0s)]
*  And what it really comes down to is what I think is at the end of the day, I trust bond, you know, I trust Patel. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1838.0s)]
*  I trust Trump. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1844.0s)]
*  And I got to say, but I'm going to get a little bit out over her skis a little bit. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1846.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1850.0s)]
*  But that says she handed out the. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1851.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, officer. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1853.0s)]
*  But but that said, listen, I'm not defending the way she handled it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1854.0s)]
*  But that said, put yourself in their position. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1858.0s)]
*  You get in there and you open it up. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1860.0s)]
*  You say this is a gold mine. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1862.0s)]
*  You're going to give that to the media. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1863.0s)]
*  So I am choosing and it's a choice. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm choosing to trust them. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1868.0s)]
*  All right, Kat, your head's about to explode and that's going to ruin Jamie's shirt. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1870.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1874.0s)]
*  It's the only one he owns. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1875.0s)]
*  I think that to expect anybody to just go, all right, cool, makes sense to me is gaslighting, especially Pam Bondi. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1878.0s)]
*  This is entirely her fault, too. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1887.0s)]
*  It's not like people are running around thinking there's something here for no reason. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1889.0s)]
*  It's because you said it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1893.0s)]
*  Yeah, she said, I have the client list on my desk and then you're just never going to say anything again. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1895.0s)]
*  You said that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1902.0s)]
*  So what was it like? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1903.0s)]
*  Did you look at it again and realize it was a list of lists that you don't have or a grocery list or Angie's list or Craig's list? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1904.0s)]
*  What list? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1913.0s)]
*  I think you have to say something. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1914.0s)]
*  You can't just come out that hard and then be like, I had just get it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1916.0s)]
*  Like she didn't even say just kidding. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1920.0s)]
*  She didn't explain it at all. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1921.0s)]
*  That's why I think nothing. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1922.0s)]
*  I think that their defense was so feeble that they wanted you to know that it was a cover up. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1924.0s)]
*  That's my theory to it. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1929.0s)]
*  Like it's like we know we know something is there. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1931.0s)]
*  That's not good enough when you go that hard. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1934.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1936.0s)]
*  I have a lot of faith, by the way, Paul. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1937.0s)]
*  That's I mean, she shouldn't have said all that if she didn't want to have to answer for it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1939.0s)]
*  But she did. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1942.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1943.0s)]
*  All right, Olivia. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1944.0s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1945.0s)]
*  First time. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1946.0s)]
*  Do you think that? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1947.0s)]
*  Oh, that's just weird. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1948.0s)]
*  What if she sucks? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1956.0s)]
*  Then I got to pretend that I got to pretend like she's good because you applauded her. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1958.0s)]
*  Oh, so anyway, Paul says something that's kind of true. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1963.0s)]
*  It's like what if they did they were talking about we wanted to see it, but they didn't know what was in it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1968.0s)]
*  And then they see what's in it and they go, holy crap, we can't show this. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1972.0s)]
*  Well, the deleted minute is very strange and her explanation. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1975.0s)]
*  I mean, I have a faint understanding of VHS tapes, but like I don't understand that. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1979.0s)]
*  So the missing minute happens at the end of every tape. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1985.0s)]
*  They say that happens all the time. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1988.0s)]
*  Once a day or something. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1990.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1991.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1993.0s)]
*  So that doesn't quite make sense to me. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1994.0s)]
*  I mean, she says that there obviously is child pornography on there. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=1995.0s)]
*  To me, a big question I have is what if the scandal is just pedophilia? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2000.0s)]
*  I mean, who says it has to be more than that? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2006.0s)]
*  That in and of itself is atrocious. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2008.0s)]
*  Who says that obviously people are raising a lot of questions about Israel and, you know, was he working for Mossad or something like that? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2011.0s)]
*  I have not seen anything that would make me think that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2018.0s)]
*  To me, it's possible that the scandal is just right out there in the open and it is what it is. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2022.0s)]
*  And perhaps he killed himself because, wow, it does sound really stressful and shameful to be in the situation he was in. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2027.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just straight up pedophilia. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2035.0s)]
*  That's enough to kill yourself. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2038.0s)]
*  You don't need this other world of intrigue to make it as bad as it is. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2040.0s)]
*  But, Jamie, I'm so glad you haven't killed yourself. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2045.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2049.0s)]
*  Because God knows you have many reasons. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2050.0s)]
*  I've always had terrible aim. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2053.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2055.0s)]
*  But it is, I mean, what if, okay, pedophile ring that was used as a honey pot and we find out that our CIA was involved, that would make us sick to our stomach, right? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2057.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2069.0s)]
*  What if, maybe there's a simple explanation for all this, what if that one minute missing from the gel tape, what if they murdered him during it? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2071.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2079.0s)]
*  Because you get in a lot of trouble if you murder someone and it's on video. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2084.0s)]
*  That is implausible. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2087.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2090.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2091.0s)]
*  And I'm wondering, if we find this manifest, is it going to even be people's real names? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2092.0s)]
*  Like, if I'm on that jet, I'm not going to give my risk, it's probably going to be a whole list like, oh, we're looking for Hugh Jazz. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2097.0s)]
*  It was on his way to the, Ben Dover went over six times. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2102.0s)]
*  And Bill Clinton. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2108.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2111.0s)]
*  No one's going to arrest me. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2112.0s)]
*  I'm above the law. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2115.0s)]
*  I think that it was stupid to think there was a client list to begin with because what criminal keeps a client list. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2116.0s)]
*  But there's enough, there were stacks of information there that, again, you didn't say there was a client list. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2121.0s)]
*  I didn't say that Pam Bondi was one on her desk. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2126.0s)]
*  Yeah, she said the file was on her. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2129.0s)]
*  Look, this is the thing. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2131.0s)]
*  If you really want to drill down on it, they got a lot of stuff from the search warrants. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2132.0s)]
*  Everybody knows they got in there. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2136.0s)]
*  They got all those tapes. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2137.0s)]
*  All those houses were wired up. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2138.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2139.0s)]
*  So if you really want to find out what was there, see, everybody gets lost in the confusion. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2140.0s)]
*  Everybody's yelling. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2144.0s)]
*  If you want to put a very fine point on it to find out a little bit more, at least say, what's the search warrant return? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2145.0s)]
*  Because when you do a search warrant, there's a document is what we got. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2150.0s)]
*  Judge, here you go. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2153.0s)]
*  Well, they did at least three or four search warrants, right? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2155.0s)]
*  The house in New York City, the house in Florida, house in the Bahamas, whatever the hell it was, the island. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2158.0s)]
*  They got to write it down. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2162.0s)]
*  And so if you look at the search warrant, 60 tapes featuring boldface Hollywood names. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2163.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2169.0s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2170.0s)]
*  So nobody has come out with that. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2171.0s)]
*  And that's what I'd actually like to see if we really want to drill in. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2172.0s)]
*  We'll be continuing this whole hour on this topic. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2175.0s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2179.0s)]
*  Or am I? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2181.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2183.0s)]
*  Jamie, Jamie, I love you. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2188.0s)]
*  Everything was a lie. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2191.0s)]
*  Can we? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2193.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2194.0s)]
*  Can we please delete the last minute of this tape? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2195.0s)]
*  Up next, Ilhan's daughter takes desperate measures. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2200.0s)]
*  That was good. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmKgHJTxj8&t=2208.0s)]
