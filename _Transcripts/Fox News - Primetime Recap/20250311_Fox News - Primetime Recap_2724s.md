# Fox News Highlights - March 10, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1.5s)]
*  Mock it, shock it, crock it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=4.4s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=6.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=10.84s)]
*  If you ever wondered if there were too many lawyers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  in America, well, any doubt should be put to rest [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=14.52s)]
*  because meet University of Houston Law Center graduate, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=17.82s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=21.52s)]
*  They continue to say things like the illegals [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=23.12s)]
*  and that they broke the law coming in, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=25.76s)]
*  but what they're not telling the American people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=28.1s)]
*  is that it is a civil violation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=29.860000000000003s)]
*  It is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=32.1s)]
*  It's not a criminal. It's a crime. It's not a crime. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=36.78s)]
*  Ah, perhaps the good congresswoman skipped [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=40.84s)]
*  too many criminal law classes or just doesn't check basic facts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=43.38s)]
*  before she speaks because, of course, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=47.42s)]
*  crossing the border illegally is a crime. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=49.06s)]
*  The statute is found at 8 USC 1325 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=51.82s)]
*  and it's titled improper entry by alien. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=55.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it's called alien. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=58.12s)]
*  It states that any alien who enters or attempts to enter [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=59.9s)]
*  the US at any time or place other than is designated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=62.26s)]
*  by immigration officers or obtains entry [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=65.16s)]
*  by willfully false or misleading representation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=67.86s)]
*  shall be fined and or imprisoned for up to six months [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=70.1s)]
*  for the first defense, up to two years for the second. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=72.78s)]
*  This is pretty basic stuff. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  Texas is a border state, so you should know this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=78.14s)]
*  So how does she get this wrong? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=81.22s)]
*  It's elementary. It's a second year law student, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=83.2s)]
*  what they would know. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=85.94000000000001s)]
*  What a first year associate at a law firm [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=87.34s)]
*  could get fired for not knowing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=89.64s)]
*  But always wrong and never in doubt, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett has eclipsed former bartender [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=94.62s)]
*  turned congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=97.62s)]
*  as the buzziest Democrat around. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Democrats were looking for a new thought leader [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=103.76s)]
*  and Crockett fits the bill. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=106.42000000000002s)]
*  Plus she puts the A in attitude. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  Or is that arrogant? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=111.88s)]
*  When you look and you compare me to Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=113.72s)]
*  or me to Lauren Boebert, there is no comparison. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=116.68s)]
*  And that is the life that we have always lived. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=119.46s)]
*  So the only people that are crying [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=122.12s)]
*  are the mediocre white boys that have been beaten out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=123.66s)]
*  by people that historically have had to work so much harder. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=126.52s)]
*  Oh, Crockett slams mediocre white boys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=131.86s)]
*  That's not racist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=134.98s)]
*  Texas's 30th district elected her to office in 2022 [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=136.64s)]
*  and every appearance seems to be made for TikTok. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  She's the master of the rant. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=144.9s)]
*  Let me tell you, we have a thug in charge [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=147.36s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=150.3s)]
*  And if we don't wake up, we may not have a United States [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  because right now he has only been successful [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=156.08s)]
*  in being a divider in chief. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=158.88s)]
*  I'm still trying to get over the comment [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=161.44s)]
*  about mediocre white boys. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=162.82s)]
*  Well, she seems to know absolutely nothing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  about the economy or the border, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=167.96s)]
*  but she does know a lot about how to talk smack about people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=170.36s)]
*  If you could speak directly to Elon Musk, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=174.4s)]
*  what would you say? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=176.48s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=177.84s)]
*  You know it's bad when she's getting the Bill Maher treatment. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=181.38s)]
*  The Democrats seem so lost. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  And here's Jasmine Crockett, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=186.82s)]
*  who is, I thought, a big leader in the Democratic party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Her quote is, this is a terrible nightmare. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=193.94s)]
*  Somebody slap me and wake me the up [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=196.5s)]
*  because I'm ready to get on with it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=198.78s)]
*  On with what would be my first question. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=202.42s)]
*  And also this is the way, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  this is like how a podcaster talks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=207.16s)]
*  You're so, can you imagine, I don't know, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=209.16s)]
*  Obama saying, oh man, dude, this is wack. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=211.72s)]
*  You slap me, I'm over it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, come on, man. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=218.68s)]
*  Politico has noticed it as well, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  lamenting the rise of the potty mouth Democrats. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, for now, Congresswoman Crockett is unrepentant, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=227.16s)]
*  they write. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=230.22s)]
*  She said her answer was real [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=231.06s)]
*  and reflected her frustration with Trump and Musk's actions. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=232.52s)]
*  Like, I have a potty mouth, especially when I'm mad, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=236.76s)]
*  she said. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=239.64s)]
*  We're working on it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=240.68s)]
*  We're going to pray about it, she said. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=241.56s)]
*  Well, of course, Democrats' impulse toward the radicals [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=244.5s)]
*  is to circle the wagons and blame Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=247.28s)]
*  Yeah, because of course they're going to blame Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump is the only thing they can ever blame. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=252.32s)]
*  He's at fault. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=254.92s)]
*  They say the F word, it's his problem. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=256.18s)]
*  It's also weak. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=258.54s)]
*  He's president and all they can do is throw stones [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=259.94s)]
*  and drop the F bomb. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=263.3s)]
*  They're seriously unserious people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=265.02s)]
*  Bomb throwers like Crockett are passionate [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=267.94s)]
*  about attacking Trump because it's a lot easier [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=270.42s)]
*  than actually trying to address serious problems [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=273.02s)]
*  in their own districts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, for Crockett and her cause, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=277.14s)]
*  she represents most of Dallas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=280.18s)]
*  Now, there is a lot of money in Dallas, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  but outside of Highland Park, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=284.44s)]
*  the region in parts is struggling. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=286.38s)]
*  About 17% live below the poverty line. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=288.62s)]
*  That's well above the national average of 12.5%. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=291.46s)]
*  And for education, the stats in Crockett's district are grim. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=296.1s)]
*  Only 33% of her district's fourth graders [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=300.36s)]
*  are at or above math proficiency. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=303.68s)]
*  Only 15% of eighth graders are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=307.12s)]
*  And for reading, just 20% of fourth graders [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=309.6s)]
*  and a dismal 18% of eighth graders are proficient. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=312.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  But you're not gonna see her address that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=317.88000000000005s)]
*  with passion on MSNBC. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=319.6s)]
*  And you won't see her applaud the efforts by ICE [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=322.16s)]
*  to remove criminal threats that are plaguing her state. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, these are mostly serious offenders [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=330.44000000000005s)]
*  who pose a risk to the community. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  And in Houston today, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=335.6s)]
*  we saw like hundreds and hundreds rounded up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  That was the great work of ICE. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=340.12s)]
*  But Jasmine Crockett claims to care so much about the people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  We await her TikTok video thanking Tom Holman [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=346.6s)]

*  Well, that's funny because last year, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=351.92s)]
*  she slammed Texas governor, Greg Abbott [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=353.88000000000005s)]
*  for doing the border work that Biden would not do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  If our governor felt like he really wanted to come up [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  with some federal enforcement, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  he should have ran for president of United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=364.36s)]
*  Amazing accomplishment. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  Two grammatical mistakes in one sentence. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=369.8s)]
*  Now there are a few sane Democrats [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=373.2s)]
*  who see where this ultimately leads for the party. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, man, we're screwed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=378.36s)]
*  I mean, we don't know, Democrats don't know what to do. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=380.44s)]
*  This is a nightmare. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=382.64s)]
*  You have a party that got trapped two ways. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=384.36s)]
*  One, defending a broken status quo that nobody likes [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=387.16s)]
*  because they thought that Donald Trump [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=393.16s)]
*  was gonna make it worse. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=394.64s)]
*  But when you're defending a status quo, you're gonna lose. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=395.72s)]
*  But how can Democrats shush their Crockett of shame [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=399.88s)]
*  and other embarrassments like her? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=404.56s)]
*  Now Crockett defended Al Green after he was censured [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=406.92s)]
*  for disrupting the Trump speech, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=410.04s)]
*  by shaking his cane and invoking the injustice [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  of segregation is what she did. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=415.42s)]
*  Of course, Green himself also played the race card [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=418.52s)]
*  after he was censured. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=421.88s)]
*  But look, they created this DEI monster [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=424.1s)]
*  and now we'll sit back as they're forced [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=426.64s)]
*  to try to win with it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=429.36s)]
*  Voters for themselves are gonna have to decide [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  whether F-bombs and stunts are good replacements [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  for real solutions and a compelling vision. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=440.24s)]
*  Stop pinching yourselves, Democrats. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=441.32s)]
*  This nightmare's real. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=443.0s)]
*  Look, man, we're screwed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we don't know, Democrats don't know what to do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=447.92s)]
*  This is a nightmare. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=450.48s)]
*  Listen, the Democratic party is going through [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  a massive set of internal crises. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=455.92s)]
*  You have a party that got trapped two ways. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=459.12s)]
*  One, defending a broken status quo that nobody likes [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=461.88s)]
*  and then offending most people in the country, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=467.42s)]
*  calling everybody sexist and racist and transphobic [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=470.32s)]
*  and every other name and then saying, please follow us. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  That's not a good strategy, folks. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=475.88s)]
*  Democrats are all texting each other saying, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=478.2s)]
*  we have no power and Trump is defining everything [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  and they don't even know who's calling the plays. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=484.24s)]
*  It's like trying out a new offense [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=487.6s)]
*  because you know the other team's defense sucks. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=490.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=492.24s)]
*  Yo, that's a good ass point. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=493.08s)]
*  I can fumble. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=494.6s)]
*  I know they can't recover the guy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=495.44s)]
*  A great ass point. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=497.44s)]
*  I can try this person at this position. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  I can try this person at this position. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=499.64s)]
*  We can just run through with them [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=501.02s)]
*  because they don't have no defense to stop us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=502.52s)]
*  They don't even have one person to be president. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=504.36s)]
*  Not one. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=506.08s)]
*  I saw Bill Ma say that the Democratic ticket, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=506.92s)]
*  I don't know if he was being funny, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=509.52s)]
*  but he had a real whole breakdown about it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=510.48s)]
*  during new rules. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=512.28s)]
*  What is it? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=513.12s)]
*  John Fetman and Pete Buttigieg. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=513.96s)]
*  That ain't gonna do it, bro. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  Now it's a free for all on the field. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=519.3599999999999s)]
*  You got the Democrats showing up [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=522.92s)]
*  for Trump's address to both houses of Congress [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  looking like damn fools, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=528.92s)]
*  having videos where they dancing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=533.0s)]
*  You got to be kidding me. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=536.12s)]
*  Trump didn't even have an opportunity to pass gas [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=537.64s)]
*  and this man standing up protesting. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  Protesting what? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=542.16s)]
*  He won the election. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=543.68s)]
*  I'm on The View and I got a bunch of ladies [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=547.0s)]
*  talking about there's no mandate, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  courtesy of Joy Behar. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=550.88s)]

*  Kamala Harris lost all the swing states. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=553.56s)]
*  And then these people holding up their signs. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=555.92s)]
*  These Democrats looking like damn fools. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  Republicans, you have them reeling. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=562.16s)]
*  The Democrats are reeling. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  They are falling backwards. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=566.5999999999999s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=569.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's so bad. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=570.8s)]

*  There's something wrong with them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=576.88s)]
*  It's just something, I can't even believe it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=578.92s)]
*  I looked the other night, I made a speech. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=582.5999999999999s)]
*  The Republicans were going wild [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=585.4799999999999s)]
*  and the Democrats were having their little signs up. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  Their little signs, their little tiny signs. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  And I said, it's unbelievable. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=595.2399999999999s)]
*  They don't get it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=598.2399999999999s)]
*  They don't get it now. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=599.2399999999999s)]
*  And I think they're gonna end up being a minor party [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=601.3599999999999s)]
*  if they keep going like this [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=603.52s)]
*  because people don't wanna hear about [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=604.6s)]
*  these stupid ideas that they have. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=607.12s)]
*  Democrats aren't just protesting Trump, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=609.64s)]

*  Tampon Tim's running around saying Kamala played it too safe. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=613.0s)]
*  Quote, I think we probably should have just rolled the dice [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=616.4s)]
*  and done the town halls. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=619.12s)]
*  And now Kamala's people are bad mouthing Timmy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=621.0s)]
*  This was a guy who definitely was embarrassed by his flubs, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=624.08s)]
*  didn't handle them well, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=627.12s)]
*  and seemed like there was a never ending supply of them. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=628.24s)]
*  And they said they had to tell Walls [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=631.8s)]
*  to stop calling Trump weird because it wasn't working [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=634.12s)]

*  And we finally discovered what Michelle Obama wants to do [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=640.3599999999999s)]

*  If you wanna talk to your brother, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=699.8s)]
*  you could just call him on the phone. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=701.0s)]
*  Why do you make it a podcast? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=702.56s)]
*  Is she trying to show up Barack? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=704.8s)]
*  Does she wanna take on Rogan? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=707.0s)]
*  She did all these books, the Netflix shows, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  the fruit juice, now podcasting. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=711.4s)]
*  Maybe somebody will actually listen to her. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  Because no one's listening to Hakeem. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=717.24s)]
*  He's been trying to act tough like Nancy, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=719.04s)]
*  but his message isn't hitting. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=721.36s)]
*  We have the Republicans on the run. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=723.84s)]
*  They are on the run. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=726.84s)]

*  And we have them on the run. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=729.76s)]
*  So we have them on the run. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're gonna keep our foot on the gas pedal. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=735.88s)]
*  Rank-and-file Democrats are blaming Hakeem [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=741.52s)]
*  for his soggy strategies. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=743.92s)]

*  F**k off. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  Well-timed F-bomb. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=768.64s)]
*  That can really work out when you mean it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=770.24s)]
*  But when they're all dropping F-bombs [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  out of the blue at the same time, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=774.76s)]
*  they've been programmed by pollsters. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  But some people in the media like what they're hearing. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=778.6s)]
*  What I will say about Jasmine, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=781.84s)]

*  God damn right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=785.12s)]
*  Like, I love that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=786.12s)]
*  Like, low-key, that is f**king sticky. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=787.24s)]
*  It's also relatable. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=789.88s)]
*  Like, Democrats, you got to stop talking [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=790.92s)]
*  like these Ivy League weirdos [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=792.68s)]
*  who are careful about every single word they use. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=794.68s)]
*  It's completely unrelatable. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=796.96s)]
*  You know what's so interesting? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  Jesse Watters, last night, he labeled her [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=799.64s)]
*  the face of the Democratic Party. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=801.36s)]
*  And I know Jesse might have been being funny, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=803.12s)]
*  but he's right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=805.5600000000001s)]
*  Jasmine, not to be confused with Davey Crockett, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=807.08s)]
*  is taking off like a rocket. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=809.64s)]
*  But Bernie Sanders is still the only one [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=811.72s)]
*  who can turn out a crowd. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=813.48s)]
*  Burn Dog's been on tour. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=814.84s)]
*  He's going from city to city. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=816.2s)]
*  He's holding rallies against oligarchy, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=817.8000000000001s)]
*  putting thousands in seats. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=819.88s)]

*  As to God, have a big f**k [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=825.5200000000001s)]

*  Does your God have a what? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=845.08s)]
*  That's trans-anarchist punk singer Laura Jane Grace. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=847.2s)]
*  Remember the media made a stink about a comedian [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=851.44s)]
*  cracking a Puerto Rican joke [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=853.6s)]
*  before opening up for Trump and MSG? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=854.88s)]
*  How is Bernie's opener not so much worse than that? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=857.88s)]
*  Democrats said choose your fighter, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=862.32s)]
*  and they picked a trans-anarchist punk singer. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats seem happy watching their party [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=866.88s)]
*  get hijacked by activists [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  at New York City's school board meeting the other day. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=870.52s)]
*  Trans activists stormed it and then did the Macarena. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=872.76s)]
*  At the last meeting, at Sean's love here, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=877.12s)]
*  and he's trying to come out down over there [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=880.2s)]
*  at the end of the table, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=882.08s)]
*  he's turned his face to them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=883.76s)]
*  So we took one. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=885.0s)]
*  Speaking of the female athletes, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=887.04s)]

*  in a democracy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=900.3199999999999s)]

*  and now Democrats are at his throat. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=917.48s)]
*  This is gonna be a problem for Democrats [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=919.2s)]
*  because you're not allowed to disagree. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=920.88s)]
*  If you disagree with what Democrats stand for, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=923.24s)]

*  gets kids to go outside instead of staying in on their phones. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1001.16s)]
*  And the government, with this great amount of power, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1005.0s)]
*  can do anything with it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1007.32s)]

*  They want to shut down tree houses and lemonade stands, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1045.44s)]
*  but they want to keep open a $70,000 DEI opera in Ireland. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1049.24s)]
*  I know what we have to do to keep these tree houses [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1054.68s)]
*  and lemonade stands open. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1056.68s)]
*  Tell them it's a trans tree house, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1058.4s)]
*  and an effing lemonade stand. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1061.24s)]
*  To some very disturbing news, if you watch this program, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1062.52s)]
*  you know how pathetic and unhinged [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1066.36s)]
*  the Democratic party has become. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1068.84s)]
*  But now some on the left are actually [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1071.32s)]
*  turning to outright violence. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1073.0s)]
*  Others are now openly advocating to assassinate [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1074.9199999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk, who has become a lightning rod [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1079.3999999999999s)]
*  to these radicals, and really for two simple reasons. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  One, he's working with and he's supported President Trump. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1085.1599999999999s)]
*  Number two, he has been exposing [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1088.88s)]
*  and rooting out waste fraud abuse, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  and I would argue when we get to the bottom of it, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1093.3200000000002s)]
*  a lot of corruption within our federal government, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1095.0800000000002s)]
*  and what the DC swamp has been doing [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1098.16s)]
*  with your hard-earned money. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1100.48s)]
*  Now because of these reasons, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1102.0s)]
*  Democrats, they no longer care that he's going to rescue, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1103.4s)]
*  and I pray that this goes well. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1107.0800000000002s)]
*  Astronauts, you know, lost in space and kind of abandoned [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1108.92s)]
*  from the International Space Station, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1112.68s)]
*  or helping those that were in need [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1114.64s)]
*  after Hurricane Helene with Starlink terminals [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1116.92s)]
*  that he donated after the wildfires in California. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1120.3200000000002s)]
*  Again, he stepped up, he donated again. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1123.44s)]
*  And they don't seem to care that he's working [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1126.52s)]
*  to restore vision to the blind and movement [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1128.76s)]
*  to those who are paralyzed and with spinal cord injuries [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  with something called Neuralink. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1135.24s)]
*  Nor do they seem to care, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1137.64s)]
*  the environmentally obsessive left Democrats, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1139.5600000000002s)]
*  they don't even care that Elon Musk created, by far, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1142.68s)]
*  the most successful electric vehicle company [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1145.28s)]
*  in the entire world. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1147.56s)]
*  In fact, threats and acts of terror against Tesla [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1148.52s)]
*  are now becoming common, and it's getting scary. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1152.04s)]
*  In Colorado, one Tesla dealership has been attacked [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1155.08s)]
*  multiple times since January. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1158.24s)]
*  At least one individual is now accused [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1160.32s)]
*  of trying to set the dealership on fire, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1162.28s)]
*  hurling Molotov cocktails at cars, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1164.56s)]
*  spray painting the word Nazi on the building. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1166.8s)]
*  And this past Friday, there was yet another attempt [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1169.36s)]
*  to burn the dealership to the ground. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1172.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the state of Oregon, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1173.96s)]
*  someone opened fire on a Tesla dealership there, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1175.52s)]
*  firing at least seven rounds, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1178.64s)]
*  damaging cars, breaking windows. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1180.88s)]
*  And take a look at your screen. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1182.92s)]
*  Just yesterday in Seattle, four cyber trucks, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1184.28s)]
*  you can see it right there, were torched near Boston. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1187.0800000000002s)]
*  More than six Tesla charging stations, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1191.64s)]
*  they were set ablaze by the lunatic left. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1194.4s)]
*  And there have been reported acts of vandalism [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1197.8400000000001s)]
*  and violence against Tesla now all over the country. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1200.64s)]
*  And sadly, I hate to ever report this about anybody, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1204.64s)]
*  I don't really care what your politics are. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1207.92s)]
*  Now Elon Musk himself is facing constant real death threats, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1210.04s)]
*  including one woman on TikTok, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1214.08s)]
*  openly calling for his assassination, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1216.48s)]
*  while bragging she's not paid taxes in seven years. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1218.92s)]
*  Other lunatics openly hold signs of protest, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1222.08s)]
*  calling for Elon's murder. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1224.84s)]
*  Just today, X was temporarily shut down [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1226.56s)]
*  because of a major cyber attack. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1230.36s)]
*  According to Musk himself, quote, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1232.36s)]
*  there was, still is, a massive cyber attack against X. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1234.12s)]
*  We get attacked every day, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1238.36s)]
*  but this was done with a whole lot of resources, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1239.6s)]
*  either a large coordinated group [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1242.6s)]
*  and or a country is involved. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1245.04s)]
*  Now contrary to the incredibly dumb talking points [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1247.36s)]
*  from Democrats, Elon Musk is leading Doge, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1250.08s)]
*  and he's losing money in the process. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1253.28s)]
*  He's not doing this to make money, he's losing it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  And you can see now, all these attacks [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1259.04s)]
*  have led to the demonization of him, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1262.64s)]
*  and it's hurting his business. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1264.84s)]
*  And his important work for the Trump administration [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1267.0s)]
*  is bad for business, and Tesla stock is down. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1270.28s)]
*  His companies and products are under constant attack, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1273.48s)]
*  all because he is daring to expose waste fraud abuse [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1276.96s)]
*  and auditing the federal government. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1281.64s)]
*  And by the way, you know what, I hate what, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1284.24s)]
*  personally, I hate what they're doing to this guy. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1286.52s)]
*  I'm going to go out, a friend of mine has a Tesla. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1288.96s)]
*  I've driven it, I loved it, it's a great car. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1291.88s)]
*  And I just frankly wanna support someone [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1295.0800000000002s)]
*  who's given up an awful lot to help our president, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  help our country, save us a ton of money, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1302.24s)]
*  and get us on the right track. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  And by the way, according to Kelly Blue Book and others, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1307.96s)]
*  Tesla is the single most American made car in the world. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1310.2s)]
*  In other words, more American, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1315.28s)]
*  over 80% of the cars American made, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1317.08s)]
*  those are American jobs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1319.72s)]
*  All these lefties attacking Tesla, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  they're going to lose high paying career jobs for people. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1324.76s)]
*  And as I said last week, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1328.76s)]
*  the Democratic Party is completely soulless [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1330.12s)]
*  in spite of Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1332.6s)]
*  We've got him on the run, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1334.0s)]
*  we'll get to that later in the program. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1335.12s)]
*  Now, we witnessed this last week when Democrats, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1337.0s)]
*  they wouldn't stand for mothers that lost their children, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1339.36s)]
*  or a 12 year old young man that survived cancer, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1341.8799999999999s)]
*  or the wife of a law enforcement officer that was killed, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1344.84s)]
*  or a young man that lost his father [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1348.24s)]
*  and is now going to West Point. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1349.9599999999998s)]
*  They couldn't bother to stand and clap for any of them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1351.52s)]
*  And whether or not you like Elon Musk, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1354.12s)]
*  he's right about simple truths and a simple fact. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1356.24s)]
*  The United States, our country, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1359.8799999999999s)]
*  is spending itself into oblivion. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1361.8799999999999s)]
*  We will not survive as a country [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1364.56s)]
*  if we keep spending like this. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1367.32s)]
*  We keep robbing from our children and grandchildren. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1369.04s)]
*  And this is your money, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1371.84s)]
*  and the average American makes $66,000 a year, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1372.88s)]
*  and they're spending and wasting [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1376.2s)]
*  hundreds of billions of your dollars. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind, the federal pre-COVID budget [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  was $4.5 trillion. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1382.3600000000001s)]
*  It is now over $6 trillion [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1384.2800000000002s)]
*  after Biden's wild four year spending spree. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1386.92s)]
*  Now think about that, the pandemic's long been over. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  Spending levels never went down under Joe and Kamala. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1392.1200000000001s)]
*  Now that brings us to a Hannity investigation [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1395.88s)]
*  into what Joe and Kamala were doing with your money. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1397.92s)]
*  Let's start with Stacey Abrams. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1400.8000000000002s)]
*  She apparently was granted a $2 billion contract [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1402.52s)]
*  to buy energy efficient appliances [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1405.48s)]
*  for low income Americans. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1407.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1408.52s)]
*  I led a program called Vitalizing Desoto. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1409.84s)]
*  We worked in a tiny town in South Georgia [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1413.44s)]
*  to demonstrate that by replacing [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1415.72s)]
*  energy inefficient appliances with efficient appliances, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1420.0s)]
*  you can lower your cost. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1423.08s)]
*  And based on that program, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1424.56s)]
*  a coalition of organizations, famous organizations, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1426.72s)]
*  came together and said to the EPA, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1431.36s)]
*  if we can do this here, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1434.84s)]
*  we can do this for millions more Americans. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  Let us invest the money of America [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1439.4399999999998s)]
*  in lowering the cost for Americans. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1441.6s)]
*  And the EPA said, okay, great, go for it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1443.84s)]
*  Now sadly, that is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1447.84s)]
*  For example, Biden's trillion dollar American rescue plan [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1450.08s)]
*  spent almost no money on COVID recovery, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1452.84s)]
*  instead cheated and created this giant slush fund [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  for state and local governments, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1459.1999999999998s)]
*  including Billions for California and New York [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1461.4s)]
*  and other deep blue states. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  Billions went to housing illegal immigrants [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1465.2s)]
*  that they allowed unvetted into the country. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  New libraries, two billion was sent [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1470.72s)]
*  to non-existent country level governments. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1473.0400000000002s)]
*  400 million went to renovate state parks [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1476.8000000000002s)]
*  and trails in Michigan. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1479.2800000000002s)]
*  Joe spent a whopping 15 million [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1480.72s)]
*  on a sports complex in New Jersey. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1482.44s)]
*  Nearly a million to build luxury apartments in Connecticut. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  738 million went out to cover 500,000 convicted prisoners, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1488.72s)]
*  including the Boston Marathon bomber. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1493.52s)]
*  And get this, there were even $1,400 stimulus checks [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1496.0800000000002s)]
*  sent to Japanese citizens that were living in Japan. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1500.04s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1503.8s)]
*  According to a study for the Center for Renewing America, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1504.96s)]
*  more than $1.1 trillion was directed to programs [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1508.4s)]
*  infused with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1511.76s)]
*  On top of all the USAID money that went to DEI [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1515.52s)]
*  and the Green New Deal and transgenderism and wokeism. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is madness. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1522.92s)]
*  We could spend all night talking about trillions [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1524.24s)]
*  of wasted taxpayer dollars, your money, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1527.04s)]
*  that Joe and Kamala burned through [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1529.84s)]
*  in the worst imaginable ways, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1532.28s)]
*  causing inflation, high taxes, economic suffering. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1534.56s)]
*  And yet Democrats are violently angry with Elon Musk [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1538.84s)]
*  for trying to identify this waste and abuse [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1542.48s)]
*  to save our country from what would be economic doom [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1544.8s)]
*  down the line. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1547.36s)]
*  They're of course insane. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1549.08s)]
*  And by the way, they're not just angry at Musk. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1550.68s)]
*  Anyone connected with Donald Trump [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1553.04s)]
*  faces an angry left-wing radicalized mob. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1555.12s)]
*  And of course, this includes the vice president [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1558.9199999999998s)]
*  and even his young family. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1561.56s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1562.84s)]
*  Look at my three-year-old daughter now. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1564.48s)]
*  And I told you, I talked to you for five minutes. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1566.72s)]
*  When you signed up for this job, I asked what you agreed. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1569.0s)]
*  Yeah, you need to sign them up. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1570.9199999999998s)]
*  I did not agree to have my three-year-old, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1572.2s)]
*  to have people run around and yell at her. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1575.0400000000002s)]
*  And I did talk to you, and I said, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1576.96s)]
*  if I talk to you for a few minutes, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1579.16s)]
*  will you leave my three-year-old daughter alone [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1580.48s)]
*  and you see the end of this? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1581.96s)]
*  So I'd like you guys to respect that. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1582.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1584.72s)]
*  Now, the vice president responded on an X. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1586.8400000000001s)]
*  He wrote, quote, today, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1589.16s)]
*  while walking my three-year-old daughter, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1590.3200000000002s)]
*  a group of protesters followed us around and shouted [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1592.3600000000001s)]
*  as my daughter grew increasingly anxious and scared. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1595.24s)]
*  I decided to speak with the protesters [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  in the hopes that I could trade [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1599.92s)]
*  a few minutes of conversation [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1601.24s)]
*  for them leaving my toddler alone. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1602.96s)]
*  Nearly all of them agreed. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1605.52s)]
*  It was mostly a respectful conversation. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1607.0s)]
*  But if you chase in a three-year-old kid [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1609.0800000000002s)]
*  as part of a political protest, you know, you're messed up. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1611.6000000000001s)]
*  Vance is absolutely right. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1616.0s)]
*  But sadly, Democrats, they continue to spiral. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1617.28s)]
*  But according to Keem Jeffries, Republicans are on the run. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1620.24s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1624.28s)]

*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1653.4s)]
*  So over the weekend, the Secret Service shot a man [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1655.8000000000002s)]
*  in a confrontation near the White House. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1658.48s)]

*  Applause, clapping the shooting of a president? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1667.88s)]
*  A Southwest Airlines flight had to return to the gate [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1673.0400000000002s)]
*  after a female passenger stripped naked [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1675.6200000000001s)]
*  and raced up and down the aisle. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1678.6000000000001s)]
*  No, I was just waiting for a picture. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1684.24s)]
*  No pictures? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1688.94s)]
*  In a related story, guess who just booked a flight [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1690.8000000000002s)]

*  for 25 minutes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1704.4s)]
*  It confused many of the passengers who ended up seeing [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1706.2800000000002s)]
*  two landing strips that day. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1709.16s)]

*  to the US because of clogged toilets. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1713.78s)]
*  Sorry about that, said one passenger. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1716.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1723.78s)]
*  Over the weekend, a 4.1 magnitude earthquake [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1726.78s)]
*  shook Los Angeles. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1728.98s)]
*  The tremors were so strong, LA Mayor Karen Bass [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1730.98s)]
*  felt them in Africa. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1733.5800000000002s)]
*  The aftershocks were so intense, Gavin Newsom's hair [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1734.98s)]
*  actually moved. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1737.38s)]
*  In fact, one was so strong, it actually flipped Gavin [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1739.78s)]
*  back to his original position on trans athletes. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1743.58s)]
*  You weren't feeling it? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1750.58s)]
*  It's okay, you weren't feeling it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1751.58s)]
*  There were fractures, there were cracks, there were breaks, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1753.58s)]
*  and that was just in Cher's face. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1756.58s)]
*  And the next morning, the plane was taken to the airport [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1758.78s)]
*  and the plane was taken to the airport. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1761.58s)]
*  And that was in Cher's face. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1763.78s)]
*  I agree, I agree with you. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1768.58s)]
*  Over the weekend, a guy broke the world record [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1770.58s)]
*  for standing in the same spot for 38 hours straight, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1772.58s)]
*  breaking the previous record of everyone [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1776.58s)]
*  who has been to the DMV. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1778.58s)]
*  But 38 hours without moving? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1782.58s)]
*  That's amateur hour, said one man. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1784.58s)]
*  Futurists predict tech-obsessed humans could have hunchbacks [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1794.58s)]
*  and smaller brains by the year 2100. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1797.58s)]
*  I think we found patient zero for this study. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1801.18s)]
*  And finally, Dylan Mulvaney was a guest on The View today. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1809.58s)]
*  Dylan enjoyed being on the show, even though Mulvaney [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1814.58s)]
*  was the only one there without a penis. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1817.58s)]
*  So tonight's topic, friends. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1820.1799999999998s)]
*  We all know what friends are. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1823.98s)]
*  We have them ourselves. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1825.98s)]
*  Well, maybe not all of us. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1827.58s)]
*  I knew that was coming. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1830.58s)]
*  But we can talk to our friends on the show together. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1832.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1837.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1839.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1841.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1843.58s)]
*  I will. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1845.58s)]
*  But we can talk to our friends honestly, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1847.58s)]
*  and we can give our friends sound advice, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1850.4199999999998s)]
*  like the time I told MC Hammer, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1853.02s)]
*  don't worry about money, you'll be popular forever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1854.76s)]
*  But also a good friend would tell you not to sing in public. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1857.6599999999999s)]
*  Which side are you on? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1864.06s)]
*  Trump's coming for our unions. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1866.9399999999998s)]
*  He wants us all to fail. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1870.1799999999998s)]
*  He wants us to, to bow to him. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1873.4399999999998s)]
*  But we want him in jail. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1876.88s)]
*  This little light of mine, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1879.48s)]
*  I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1882.7800000000002s)]
*  let it shine, let it shine. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1887.0800000000002s)]
*  Science lights the way. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1890.48s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1892.72s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1893.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, if they told us they'd stop singing, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1896.72s)]
*  if we impeached Trump, we might do it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1898.5600000000002s)]
*  But who would let you go out in public and sound so awful? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1901.6599999999999s)]
*  Besides Maroon 5's tour manager. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1907.7s)]
*  Not true friends, that's for sure. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1910.48s)]
*  But sadly, there's a group of people [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1912.98s)]
*  who don't understand the concept of friendship, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1914.34s)]
*  and it's the modern Democrat. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1916.18s)]
*  Here's Joy Behar talking about refusing to share a kidney. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1918.02s)]
*  I find that bizarre. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1922.12s)]
*  I can be friends with a Trump supporter. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1922.96s)]
*  I won't give them a kidney, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1923.96s)]
*  but I could be friends with them. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1925.6599999999999s)]
*  Hey Joy, it's a kidney, not a pizza. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1927.72s)]
*  Of course she's kidding at first, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1931.3s)]
*  but then she goes on to explain the moral foundation [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1935.26s)]
*  for her resentment, and it's the same one [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1938.26s)]
*  that drives all deadly ideologies. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1940.24s)]
*  The thing about it is it's not just about politics. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1943.5s)]
*  It's about morality, ethics, it's about cruelty, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1945.84s)]
*  it's about discrimination, it's about a lot of things. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1948.52s)]
*  So those are personal human values. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1951.6399999999999s)]
*  We're not really just talking about fiscal conservative [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1953.68s)]
*  who pays more taxes. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1956.3799999999999s)]
*  We're talking about you as a human being. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1957.96s)]
*  So it's hard to be friends with someone [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1961.92s)]
*  who signs on to something like that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1963.08s)]
*  See what she did there? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1965.42s)]
*  She removed the inhumanity of her adversary, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1966.72s)]
*  placing them in a box labeled not wrong, but evil. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1969.22s)]
*  So now you can treat them the way you fantasize [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1973.1000000000001s)]
*  that they might treat you. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1975.26s)]
*  If you think they're Nazis, then you can act like Nazis. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1976.96s)]
*  But once they lose elections, they decide, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1980.74s)]
*  well, these bad people could do podcasts really well. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1984.6000000000001s)]
*  It must have mattered, so let's do podcasts. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1988.4s)]
*  But it's like Jesse Waters thinking he can play [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1991.3400000000001s)]
*  like Michael Jordan by shaving off the rest [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1993.24s)]
*  of his remaining hair. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1995.64s)]
*  It's not gonna work. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=1997.0800000000002s)]
*  But oh, once they get shellacked by so-called bad people, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2000.98s)]
*  their solution is to do what the bad people do. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2004.48s)]
*  Well, good luck, because they don't understand [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  the organic nature of podcasting. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2010.42s)]
*  Podcasts were built on this concept called friends, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2012.9s)]
*  with friends doing other friends' show [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2016.48s)]
*  without fear of being canceled. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2019.52s)]
*  But since everything Dems do is inorganic, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2022.42s)]
*  from the protests to their stupid TikTok videos, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2025.02s)]
*  they assume they can just create, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2027.9s)]
*  artificially make a podcast the same way. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2029.7s)]
*  It's like watching the Super Bowl and thinking, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2032.7s)]
*  yeah, I could do that too. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2034.54s)]
*  Neglecting the years of experience and raw talent [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2036.3s)]
*  that leads to that moment. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2038.5s)]
*  But they can't do podcasts for they have no friends, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2040.28s)]
*  meaning people who will be honest with them. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2042.94s)]
*  It's why Dems do embarrassing in public, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2047.26s)]
*  and how no one will tell Debbie Wasserman Schultz [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2049.9s)]
*  her hairstyle looks like someone dumped [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2052.24s)]
*  a casserole on her head. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2054.16s)]
*  But if the podcast world is based on people [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2061.2s)]
*  who trust each other, how do Democrats find those people? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2063.44s)]
*  How can you make friends if everybody around you [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  is terrified that one slip up might land them in exile? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2070.58s)]
*  That's how you get people to say Rachel Levine is female [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2075.18s)]
*  and Chris Hayes is a man. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2077.98s)]
*  That will never happen here, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2081.8199999999997s)]
*  because we like you enough to call bull. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2083.12s)]
*  But if Dems were to actually call BS, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2086.3199999999997s)]
*  their so-called allies, would turn on them, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2088.2599999999998s)]
*  like Brit Hume does when you bring up [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2091.06s)]
*  his brief stint in Menudo. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2092.7s)]
*  Look what happened with Joe Rogan. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2098.6s)]
*  Where did all his lefty friends go? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2100.04s)]
*  And countless other former Libs who found freedom [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2102.48s)]
*  in the world outside woke them. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2104.66s)]
*  They realized that you can't work with someone who, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2106.3599999999997s)]
*  when the going gets rough, abandons you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2108.6s)]
*  That's called an informant, with friends like that [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2111.46s)]
*  who needs Mike Pence. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2114.08s)]
*  It comes down to the three words of advice [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2120.44s)]
*  I've given to the very start of this crazy business, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2123.04s)]
*  share the risk. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2126.2799999999997s)]
*  What you saw on the right, especially in podcasts [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2128.3599999999997s)]
*  and comedy, was the sharing of risk among friends. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2130.68s)]
*  And that's appealing, and most of all, it's real. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2134.38s)]
*  The Dems spent so much time cultivating fake compassion [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2136.5600000000004s)]
*  through identity politics and DEI [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2139.1200000000003s)]
*  that they abandoned the real thing, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2141.1200000000003s)]
*  which means after every manufactured march, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2143.46s)]
*  the leftist went home alone, too miserable and wretched [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2146.0s)]
*  to feed their 27 cats. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2149.84s)]
*  Because the recipe for their power, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2152.4s)]
*  which is the power to cancel, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2154.0s)]
*  burns every real human bridge in their lives. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2155.6400000000003s)]
*  It's how ideologies play out. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2158.48s)]
*  For that system to expand, you have to reduce your humanity. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2160.38s)]
*  To a point where you can explain why letting a friend die [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2163.74s)]
*  without a kidney is your moral choice. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2166.24s)]
*  But really, who wants one of Joy's kidneys anyway? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2169.98s)]
*  Seriously, I'm sure the kidney wants to get the f*** [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2172.7799999999997s)]
*  out of there. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2177.08s)]
*  Let's welcome... [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2180.56s)]
*  ...Pedestan! [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2183.9199999999996s)]

*  that you are on Fox, but you never have friends on. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2240.3199999999997s)]

*  Right. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  That sounds like a sitcom college. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2273.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm off to Long Island University, Mom. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2275.7200000000003s)]

*  We never talked about it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2300.52s)]
*  I still don't know until I meet my college friends now. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2301.7799999999997s)]

*  But today it really defines who you are my I have three kids college age [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2311.94s)]
*  They all know who he with who they voted for and where they stand so things are really different [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2315.7400000000002s)]
*  So I thought I'm gonna be above it all I saw the theme of your monologue [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2320.1800000000003s)]
*  And I thought to myself I'm gonna be somebody who doesn't judge somebody by who they vote for they thought about it [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2324.38s)]
*  I'm hanging out and I meet somebody and they say hey [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2329.32s)]
*  Yeah, great to see you want to go for a movie later first just let me make a little note [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2331.88s)]
*  Elon, oh more a genius who really loves America. Sorry. I'm busy [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2336.08s)]
*  How about how about Adam Schiff? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2340.3599999999997s)]
*  I find him trustworthy somebody can really rely on and who always tells the truth [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2342.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to the movie [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2346.64s)]
*  So you really can't get past it and I challenge you if you were hanging out with somebody and they let them know that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2348.04s)]
*  Adam Schiff and Elon, oh more was your guiding light. You would not continue that relationship. I challenge you. Yes. Thank God [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2354.12s)]
*  I'm a hermit. I don't really go out anything right now. No one really asks [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2360.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2365.52s)]
*  You check your cell phone constantly [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  Rare body odor issue right can't be cured Madison first time on the show. How excited are you so excited? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2369.88s)]
*  You are on kind of the news side [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2381.2s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  So you have to be do you find that you have to be careful like you're always in danger of somebody calling you going Madison [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2384.32s)]
*  You're not supposed to say that [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2390.8s)]
*  No, I mean the good thing is it's my job to not have an opinion which we'll see if I get to keep my job [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2392.2s)]
*  after the show but [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2397.8799999999997s)]
*  So I get to just really play the middle and talk to people [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2399.64s)]
*  And if I do say something the call is not you shouldn't say that it's why the heck did you say that right? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2402.64s)]
*  But to the point when I was again researching just like Brian working very hard ahead of the show [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2408.56s)]
*  I just think I actually disagree [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2413.22s)]
*  I think joy does have friends that are Trump voters because there's a majority of them in the US [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  She just doesn't know it because they would never tell her and this is part of the problem [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2422.06s)]
*  If you can't have the conversations and then obviously is that a real friend if they can't tell the truth [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2426.18s)]
*  But yeah [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2430.74s)]
*  If you go on national television and say I can't be friends with a Trump voter like you're either not gonna text her back [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2431.4199999999996s)]
*  Or you just keep your mouth shut that is the draw one of them [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2437.7799999999997s)]
*  It's preference falsification where people do not tell you what that's why people thought Trump would lose because a lot of people wouldn't say [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2440.5s)]
*  They were voting for him [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2447.8999999999996s)]
*  So look who's here in this little chair [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2450.06s)]
*  It's Mark Cuban's retarded brother [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2459.3s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry Greg I I didn't dress like little Mirs linsky for a TV show [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2471.26s)]
*  I love you Joe. I would hang out with you if you would just give me your phone number [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2480.7400000000002s)]
*  What did you say I would hang out with you if you would give me your phone number [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2485.82s)]
*  Well, you know, it's it's not listed. Do people still say that no, it's not only on your show [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2488.7400000000002s)]
*  What did you make the idea? Do you have have you lost friends? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2494.5s)]
*  Yes, I have lost friends over politics, but I think it's a good thing because what kind of friend doesn't think I can have my own views [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2498.78s)]
*  You know, that's the best reason to lose a friend Greg the worst reason to lose a friend [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2504.42s)]
*  Alligators [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2509.52s)]
*  Every time I've lost a friend to an alligator, it's always the same old thing. They're like help Joe [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2511.88s)]
*  I'm being eaten by an alligator and I'm like, I don't think we should be friends anymore [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2516.92s)]
*  But I'll say this it seemed to me like joy was trying to really have it both ways [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2521.92s)]
*  It's like it's like saying hey, I will be friends with you [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2526.88s)]
*  I will be your friend, but I would also let you die [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2530.04s)]
*  That is the true definition of having it both ways it's like a battery like Capri pants, yes, I [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2534.44s)]
*  Never work at pre-pants I have dozens of pairs [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2545.96s)]
*  Each one from a different victim [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2551.64s)]
*  You know serial killers all collect one thing [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2557.6s)]
*  Capri pants Kennedy [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2562.12s)]
*  Because they're called shorts, but when you put them on they go down to your ankles [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2564.52s)]
*  All right, let's go to break [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2576.36s)]
*  Kennedy can you like I could not imagine you navigating these circles like where you have well, you probably have no [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3M9OVdnNu0&t=2579.0s)]
