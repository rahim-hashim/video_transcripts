# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 19, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0)
*  A historic win, a popular vote victory? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=0.0s)]
*  Has Trump World and hardworking Americans, they're in a great mood. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=4.0s)]
*  We all want to believe that the mandate is undeniable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=8.2s)]
*  Trump advance, there are hard charging cabinet nominees, Elon Musk, and a Republican House [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=12.96s)]
*  and Senate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=17.72s)]
*  How could the goal of transforming government not be reached? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=18.96s)]
*  Well, before Trump has the opportunity to really drain the swamp, the swamp monsters [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  will fight for their natural habitat, no matter who they're up against. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=28.72s)]
*  Government agents, scientists, soldiers, secret formulas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=33.64s)]
*  None of them belong in this swamp. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=39.12s)]
*  Only one thing does. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  The swamp thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=46.16s)]
*  Well, the swampy defenders of the status quo find ways to survive, and this includes setting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=50.16s)]
*  traps for trespassers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=56.88s)]
*  And while the Democrats still have power on Capitol Hill, they want to hamstring Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=58.84s)]
*  by forcing hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteful and even destructive year-end [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=63.32s)]
*  spending, including spending for programs and initiatives that voters don't want or [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=68.48s)]
*  support, like they've done, of course, so many times before. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=73.16s)]
*  We've been through this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=76.0s)]
*  Now, this is such a scam and it seems to happen every year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=77.0s)]
*  With members anxious to leave for Christmas, they just abdicate their duty to be faithful [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  stewards of our money. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Courtesy of Senator Mike Lee, here are just a few of the ticking time bombs that could [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  be passed in a Swatnibus bill. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=92.28s)]
*  First, a year-long continuing resolution that would cement into place the Democrats' worst [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=95.12s)]
*  spending abuses for the first part of the Trump administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  Disaster. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=105.4s)]
*  Second, we can be locked in for continuing Ukraine money. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=106.4s)]
*  Might as well have Treasury just print, what, another 50 billion and throw it in a bonfire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=115.04s)]
*  Total waste there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=116.04s)]
*  And third, the fast tracking of Afghan nationals into permanent residency status, even when [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=117.52s)]
*  we know, courtesy of the inspector general's report, that they can't even be guaranteed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=125.16s)]
*  to have ever been properly vetted. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=130.36s)]
*  And fourth, Democrat authored new standards and regulations on artificial intelligence [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=133.16s)]
*  that will include DEI requirements. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=139.6s)]
*  AI with DEI. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  What could go wrong? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  So will Republicans say no to this madness and help make Trump's first year in office [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=148.32s)]
*  successful? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  Will they stay as long as it takes in December to force the Democrats to back down? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  This is what Speaker Mike Johnson warned about back in September. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  We have broken the Christmas Omni, and I have no intention of going back to that terrible [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  tradition. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=167.6s)]
*  So there won't be a Christmas Omni bus. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=168.6s)]
*  If somebody asked me in the hallway a little while ago, will there be many buses? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  We don't want any buses. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=173.32s)]
*  We're not going to do any buses. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=174.32s)]
*  OK? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=175.32s)]
*  Now, beyond that, Sauerpost Schumer is trying to stymie Trump's agenda by ramming through [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=176.32s)]
*  as many liberal judges as possible before the Senate changes hands. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=181.24s)]
*  Last night, I also filed cloture on another nine nominees to serve as district judges [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=186.64s)]
*  across the country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=191.16s)]
*  I will now have filed cloture on a total of 12 district court judges since the end of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=192.4s)]
*  last week. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=197.2s)]
*  We're not done. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=198.2s)]
*  There are more judges to consider and confirm. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=199.2s)]
*  We're going to spend the rest of the week and the rest of this year focused on confirming them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=202.24s)]
*  Yeah, he looks like a real winner there, reading his notes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=206.52s)]
*  Well, Trump urged Senate Republicans, of course, to step up and slow down the cram down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=210.12s)]
*  And meanwhile, Democrats haven't given up their strategy of branding everything Trump [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=216.56s)]
*  does as extremist. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  But now it's using the veneer of bipartisanship to do it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=223.16000000000003s)]
*  But what's more extremist than always pushing war? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=228.68s)]
*  We are prepared to work hard to find bipartisan common ground with our Republican colleagues [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=231.64s)]
*  and the incoming administration on any issue whenever and wherever possible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  But at the same period of time, we will push back against far right extremism whenever [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=242.0s)]
*  necessary. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  And we know the swamp loves wars because the military industrial complex needs spending [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=249.32s)]
*  to always increase, which will happen with Biden's move authorizing Ukraine to use long [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  range weapons into Russia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=260.22s)]
*  Is this being done to box in the next administration and make it harder to pull back support for Ukraine? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=262.18s)]
*  Well, I can't speak to exactly what made this decision final. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  But I do think that it's urgent that we put Ukraine on as strong a footing as we can. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=273.74s)]
*  Look, the swamp, its allies, they've never cared about what the voters want, which includes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=280.1s)]
*  putting American Americans first. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=287.3s)]
*  After all, America first. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=290.18s)]
*  That was a cornerstone of Trump's entire campaign. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=291.3s)]
*  The Trump victory is far from a mandate. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=295.7s)]
*  President Biden won the popular vote by more than seven million votes in 2020. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=298.18s)]
*  And I didn't hear Republicans saying, OK, let's give Biden everything he wants because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=303.14s)]
*  he has the mandates. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=307.06s)]
*  No, Trump does not have a mandate and he certainly doesn't have the moral high ground. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=308.18s)]
*  Yeah, this from the party that thought calling Trump a fascist was a brilliant campaign strategy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, here's the bottom line. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  We won. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  They lost. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=324.18s)]
*  The American people don't want Joe Biden making any significant policy decisions now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=325.62s)]
*  Plus, we saw the videotape. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=331.29999999999995s)]
*  We know he's not the one making any of these moves. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=333.62s)]
*  The poor man can't even stay in a photo shoot at the G-20. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=336.82s)]
*  We know President Trump is going to stand up for himself and his priorities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=342.02s)]
*  But we also need Republicans on both sides of Capitol Hill doing their part to prevent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Schumer and Jeffries from hamstringing him until he's back in office. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=352.34s)]
*  Then the swamp monsters will be the ones running for cover. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=357.62s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  Land of the free, home of the brave, well, has now become in liberal land, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=362.82s)]
*  the land of the woke snowflake. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=368.18s)]
*  Look, don't you just hate to see liberals turning on each other like this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=370.82s)]
*  So sad to see Trump derangement syndrome is taking its toll. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=375.06s)]
*  Speaking of which tonight, we have more big news from the president-elect and bad news [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  for the radical left. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=383.7s)]
*  Donald Trump is assembling his new administration. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=384.58s)]
*  He is doing it in record time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=387.46s)]
*  According to an ABC News report, he is making appointments, nominations, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=389.06s)]
*  in quote, a quarter of the time it has taken some of his predecessors. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=393.38s)]
*  Coming up, two of those appointments will join us live, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=398.26s)]
*  including the soon-to-be deputy chief of policy, Stephen Miller, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=400.5s)]
*  along with the incoming press secretary. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=404.58s)]
*  I wouldn't wish this job on anybody, Caroline Leavitt, although I do have suggestions for her. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=406.74s)]
*  After four long years of circleback Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=411.78s)]
*  change is coming to the White House briefing room. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=417.22s)]
*  By the way, what a great idea that Ari Fleischer had. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=419.54s)]
*  He said, put new media, put talk radio, Fox News, put, you know, people in podcasting, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=423.38s)]
*  put them in the front rows and take the legacy, hate Trump media in the back. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=429.78s)]
*  Their influence is dead anyway. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  They had 90% negative coverage of Donald Trump, 90% positive for Kamala. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  Trump still wanted a landslide. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=441.7s)]
*  Nobody cares what they say. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=443.78s)]
*  And now change is coming to every facet of our federal government. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=445.78s)]
*  Might as well do it there as well. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  And whether the legacy media, the radical left like it or not, it's happening. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=451.46s)]
*  Moments ago, Donald Trump announced that American business mogul [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  and small business administrator Linda McMahon will be appointed to lead the Department of Education, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=458.42s)]
*  which might cease to exist by the end of Trump's term. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=464.66s)]
*  Now that's great. Why? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=469.22s)]
*  Because state and local governments know better how to raise their children. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=470.98s)]
*  And there should be national requirements that they must meet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=475.54s)]
*  Our friend, Dr. Mehmet Oz, he has been nominated to be the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  which Donald Trump has promised to protect, where he will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=484.82s)]
*  That'll be a great one-two punch. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=490.5s)]
*  Dan Scavino is back. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=492.42s)]
*  He has been picked to be Trump's deputy chief of staff. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=493.78s)]
*  Good choice. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=496.42s)]
*  According to reports, Vice President-elect Vance has also confirmed that Trump is interviewing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=497.46s)]
*  candidates to replace Chris Wray at the FBI. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=502.5s)]
*  Now, Wray had an opportunity after Comey, I spoke about it often, to restore the reputation, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=506.26s)]
*  the former greatness, the integrity to the FBI, which continued to operate in a very hyperpartisan [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=512.5s)]
*  manner under his watch. So Chris Wray's time as FBI director is now running short. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=518.98s)]
*  In fact, far left politically motivated bureaucrats from all across the federal government, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=524.74s)]
*  they should know that their reign of oppression on the American people is about to end. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=530.5s)]
*  The witch hunts will end. The leaking will end. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=536.82s)]
*  The abuse of power, the corruption will end. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=539.46s)]
*  The so-called resistance within our government against we the people will be over. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=542.02s)]
*  Donald Trump has nominated a team of disruptors like he said he would. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=547.14s)]
*  They are hell bent on reforming every single department. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=551.62s)]
*  Look at what Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will do. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=556.34s)]
*  Waste, fraud, abuse will be gutted. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=559.7s)]
*  Constitutional order. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  Remember the principles of limited government, greater freedom. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  They will be restored. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=568.5s)]
*  You won't have the nanny state cradle to grave, wound to the tomb, promises of the left [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=570.02s)]
*  that would never be realized anyway, that always result in broken promises, more poverty, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=575.14s)]
*  and a loss of freedom. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=581.3s)]
*  The DOJ must no longer ever, ever be weaponized. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=582.82s)]
*  We can't live in that country. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=587.22s)]
*  And institutions, great institutions like the FBI and our intelligence communities, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=588.9s)]
*  they need to be restored to their former greatness. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=594.5s)]
*  Under Donald Trump they will. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=596.82s)]
*  And despite what you hear from the hysterical legacy media, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  the incoming administration is confident Trump's cabinet will get confirmed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  Not only will Republicans have a 53 seat majority in the Senate, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=606.6600000000001s)]
*  but the president-elect is also ready and willing to use another tool at his disposal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=610.5s)]
*  It is not the ideal way to do it, but if he has to, he will, like other presidents have. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=616.1s)]
*  It's called recess appointments. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=620.9000000000001s)]
*  And like everything else that Donald Trump does, this will send the left, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=622.82s)]
*  the state-run legacy media mob, into a fit of hysteria. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=626.98s)]
*  Here's some facts. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=631.22s)]
*  Let's look at Reuters as the source, shall we? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=632.2600000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Constitution says that a president can make recess appointments to fill vacant positions [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=634.6600000000001s)]
*  when the Senate is not in session. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=641.46s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled that a president can make those appointments [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=643.38s)]
*  once the Senate has been adjourned for at least 10 days. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=647.3000000000001s)]
*  The first ever recess appointment? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=650.1s)]
*  Well, that was made by the first president himself, George Washington, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=652.18s)]
*  during the very first congressional recess in 1790. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=656.0999999999999s)]
*  More recently, Ronald Reagan made 240 recess appointments. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=659.78s)]
*  President George H.W. Bush made 77 recess appointments, including as secretary of state. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=671.3s)]
*  George W. Bush, 171. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  Barack Obama, 32. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  So this Thanksgiving, if you're sitting with your liberal relatives [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=680.82s)]
*  and they're not throwing turkey legs or mashed potatoes at you, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=684.58s)]
*  and they are freaking out, you can present them with these simple, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=687.62s)]
*  basic, fundamental facts and truth. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=691.3000000000001s)]
*  Presidents from both parties have made hundreds of recess appointments. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=693.94s)]
*  It will not be unusual. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=698.2600000000001s)]
*  It will not be unlawful for Donald Trump to do the same. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=699.7800000000001s)]
*  So tonight, we can all feel very good about Donald Trump's incoming cabinet. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  They are about to clean house in the Washington swamp. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=707.46s)]
*  There is little that anyone on the radical extreme left can do about it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=711.22s)]
*  And of course, that won't stop them from screaming, yelling, and crying and trying. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=715.7s)]
*  But their manufactured hysteria didn't work during the election. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=720.5s)]
*  It's not going to work now. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=724.02s)]
*  It's sort of like it all comes together. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=725.62s)]
*  It's just one big nine-year period of breathless Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=728.1s)]
*  And the American people rejected that overwhelmingly in the election. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=734.58s)]
*  Won't cancel culture is now about to die. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=739.14s)]
*  Americans are over it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=742.5s)]
*  They no longer listen to the media. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=744.02s)]
*  They don't care what Hollywood celebrities have to say, which is great news. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=746.26s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney could go back and focus on counting their money. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=750.18s)]
*  Americans want the American dream restored for everybody else [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=755.3s)]
*  with freedom and justice and prosperity and equal justice under the law, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=758.82s)]
*  equal application of our laws for everybody, along with a border that is secure, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=763.54s)]
*  streets that are safe, lower grocery prices and lower gas prices. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=768.9s)]
*  It's been 14 days since the Democrats had to face the truth. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=773.6999999999999s)]
*  They stink worse than the Capitol's men's room after Jerry Nadler's lunch of curry clam soup. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=777.9399999999999s)]
*  Poor Jerry. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=786.5s)]
*  But we've talked about what the winners can do now. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=787.78s)]
*  What about the losers? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=790.42s)]
*  And there are losers. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=791.78s)]
*  But it's not the ones having public meltdowns. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=793.06s)]
*  They're victims too. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=795.78s)]
*  They're no different than a hypochondriac being told that their pimple is a tumor. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=797.06s)]
*  I'm talking about the party elites like Jamie Raskin, Adam Schiff or David Muir, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=801.4599999999999s)]
*  the idiots who fueled all those lies. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=805.38s)]
*  So normally we don't give advice to people who hate us, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=808.3399999999999s)]
*  but we're only doing this because we want them to be as happy as we are, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  or at least as bubbly as Brit Hume. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=815.6199999999999s)]
*  So Dems, you need to ask yourself, where did you get your information from? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=818.74s)]
*  The people that gave you Trump hoaxes and phony fact checks also gave you the polls [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=824.18s)]
*  that had Kamala fans wasting money on champagne when they should have been buying Prozac in bulk. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=828.9s)]
*  The people you trust to give you the news steered you wrong. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=836.26s)]
*  Why? Were you allowing yourself to be fooled? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like when I tell Kill Me to meet me for lunch, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=842.8199999999999s)]
*  it's like when I tell Kill Me to meet me for lunch, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=845.54s)]
*  then when he leaves the building I take a crap in his office drawer. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=847.78s)]
*  If you feel deceived, that's not our fault. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=854.0999999999999s)]
*  Blame the media that you relied on. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=857.54s)]
*  You know, those lying sacks of poop that looked you in the eyes each night [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  for the last eight years or so and filled your heads with more poison than an unvented space heater. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=864.02s)]
*  So maybe find alternatives. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=870.18s)]
*  You're off to a great start by watching this show. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=871.78s)]
*  I've now gained all of Lawrence O'Donnell's former viewers and I welcome all 12 of you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=874.34s)]
*  Because if you really want to correct your course, you can't do that with a faulty GPS. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=883.14s)]
*  Take NBC News, who's claiming Trump won due to the diploma divide. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=890.1800000000001s)]
*  In other words, people who voted for Kamala were just more educated and smarter. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=895.38s)]
*  Well, if that's true, explain this. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=900.5s)]
*  One second guys, one second. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=904.5s)]
*  So I don't take lightly the call. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=909.62s)]
*  Sorry guys, I'm a little nervous. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=914.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=918.1s)]
*  She's passionate, she's compassionate, she shows empathy, and most of all, she is not delusional. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=920.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=928.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=930.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=932.26s)]
*  See saying you lost because you were smarter than us is a denial of reality. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=934.34s)]
*  It's like saying the sky isn't blue, the earth isn't round, or Joy Behar doesn't have a face [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  that would knock a buzzard off a s*** wagon. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=947.5400000000001s)]
*  She knows it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of parts to that one. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=954.4200000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=955.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, and it is, it's killing your party faster than inviting Chris Wallace to an orgy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=956.9s)]
*  When you lose, maybe just admit the winners knew something you didn't. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=961.7s)]
*  It had nothing to do with credentials or degrees. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=965.62s)]
*  Right now, your worldview is upside down, and really, who wants to look up Hillary's skirt? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=968.26s)]
*  So why did Trump win, and even more, why is he surrounded by a rogues gallery of rebel thinkers? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=975.1400000000001s)]
*  It's because something turned him into a cross between George Washington and Genghis Khan [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=980.34s)]
*  with a splash of Arthur Fonzarelli. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=985.38s)]
*  It was you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=988.9000000000001s)]
*  Your constant demonization backfired and made him appear appealingly dangerous. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=989.5400000000001s)]
*  So more people began to wonder what the fuss was about, and they took a look, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=994.82s)]
*  and you know what, they really liked it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=998.58s)]
*  Trump has the same effect punk rock did in the 70s, upsetting the boars and attracting the rebels. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1000.82s)]
*  Suddenly, my air supply shirt wasn't getting the ladies. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1006.74s)]
*  So maybe try doing something you've never done. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1012.1s)]
*  Assume you're a rebel. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1014.1s)]
*  Maybe try doing something you've never done. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1015.86s)]
*  Assume we're acting on our best intentions, not our worst. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1017.62s)]
*  Stop calling us garbage just because we don't think biology is a social construct. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1020.98s)]
*  We aren't trying to hurt anyone, we just want the best for our families. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1025.8600000000001s)]
*  The problem is you've made your family less relevant than politics, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1029.54s)]
*  and those muscles of familial concern have atrophied. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1034.18s)]
*  Maybe just maybe ask what's best for your family, even if you hate them. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1037.8600000000001s)]
*  As an experiment, present their side of the argument to yourself. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1042.4199999999998s)]
*  It's called steel manning, and it's the opposite of straw manning, but not quite Peyton Manning. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1046.5s)]
*  Finally, start kicking the tires of identity politics. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1053.6999999999998s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1056.4199999999998s)]
*  Look at what it actually means, who it really helps, and for how long. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1057.86s)]
*  Like a line of cocaine at a funeral, you'll see it's a temporary high. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1062.1s)]
*  Instead of uniting people, identity politics pits them against each other. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1067.3799999999999s)]
*  It's more divisive than wearing a leopard print thong on safari. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1070.82s)]
*  I know, I learned that the hard way. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1075.9399999999998s)]
*  It's a strategy, though, to keep us from focusing together on the real problems, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1078.82s)]
*  and the real culprits. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1082.82s)]
*  People make money off our conflict. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1084.26s)]
*  Those are the people who need an ass kicking. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  And on that point, we can join together. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1089.46s)]
*  So come on in, the melting pot is warm. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1092.1s)]
*  I made sure of that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm_NY7R7cC0&t=1094.6599999999999s)]
