# Fox News Highlights - April 8, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM)
*  Saving capitalism. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=0.0s)]
*  In the 1980s, it all seemed so simple and cool. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=6.88s)]
*  Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=11.84s)]
*  Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=21.52s)]
*  Well, that movie came out in 1987, the same year that, on October 19th, the stock market dropped [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=28.32s)]
*  what, about 22% one day? Now, a few days before that, the Commerce Department had announced that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=36.08s)]
*  the trade deficit in the United States was higher in August than expected. The dollar declined and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=41.52s)]
*  interest rates rose. So what was the trade deficit in 1987? Well, in 1980, it was only $25.5 billion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  But seven years later, it had jumped to a staggering $159.5 billion. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=56.96s)]
*  Okay, well, where to stand at the end of 2024? The trade deficit stood at a jaw-dropping $1.2 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=65.68s)]
*  trillion. Yeah, with, by the way, the largest deficit ever recorded with China at $295.4 billion, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=73.92s)]
*  followed by the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, and Ireland. My friends, this is unsustainable. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=83.84s)]
*  The shocking trade imbalance, which helped make Wall Street titans very wealthy, has also built [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  communist China's military into a true rival of the United States. It allowed China to invest [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=96.56s)]
*  heavily all across the globe in rare earth refining and advanced space weaponry in robotics. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=102.88s)]
*  And they're catching up at a delirious pace in the AI race, despite export controls. That was vexing, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=110.72s)]
*  by the way, to Gina Raimondo in the Biden administration even. And Trump understands [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=118.24s)]
*  that all of this combined is an existential threat to the United States. We become a rich [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=124.56s)]
*  country because of people, again, that were in the White House that allowed this to happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=130.32s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars a year, they'd make an us on trade, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=136.16s)]
*  and it shouldn't be that way. And we're going to have one shot at this, and no other president's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=139.6s)]
*  going to do this, what I'm doing. And I'll tell you what, it's an honor to do it because we have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=143.92s)]
*  been just, just destroyed what they've done to our system. If we can make a really fair deal and a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  good deal for the United States, not a good deal for other, this is America first. It's now America first. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  We have one shot at this, he said. That's the banner. That's it. Well, in other words, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=162.64s)]
*  our manufacturing, our middle class, especially non-college educated Americans, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=170.16s)]
*  are getting clobbered. They have been getting clobbered. Because as we become more reliant [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=175.6s)]
*  on foreign-made goods, we sell less and less to those countries. Factories close, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  and American communities are flattened. Like what happened when 1200 workers were laid off, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  when the Belvedere assembly plant was shut down in Illinois, the manufacturing moved to Mexico. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=194.32s)]
*  You don't know how much you love going to work until you can't go there anymore. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=200.72s)]
*  This is my home. And when they told me that we were done, it hurt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=204.08s)]
*  We've got a community of 24,000 people, and there's probably not a street you can't, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=210.56s)]
*  you can go down that somebody's not tied to this plant. We've been here since 1965. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=216.16s)]
*  It's a good job, provides a great living, and we would just like to see it come back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=223.92s)]
*  Heartbreaking. Now, the good news is that plant is actually expected to reopen in 2027, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=231.6s)]
*  and a lot of those laid off workers will be coming back. Got a huge amount of publicity [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=238.0s)]
*  when that happened. But millions of Americans will never be that lucky. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=242.56s)]
*  Now, remember, when other countries run surpluses, they have more cash over time to buy up assets, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=249.52s)]
*  including a lot of our assets. That's why Nippon Steel is trying to buy US Steel. Trump's taking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=256.96s)]
*  another look at that, as you should. And it's why Chrysler is now owned by foreigners. And it's why [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=263.12s)]
*  China has bought up some of much of our land, including farmland and our food companies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=269.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, though, we have a lot of elected officials, some of them Republicans, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=276.24s)]
*  who still think greed is good wherever it manifests itself and however it manifests itself. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=280.48s)]
*  And they don't understand that Trump's tariffs are not arbitrary. They didn't come out of thin air. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=287.04s)]
*  They come after decades of deliberate actions by foreign governments to put US companies in US [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=292.88s)]
*  markets at a disadvantage. Now, this poor Senator Tina Smith from Minnesota, she was at a hearing on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=299.36s)]
*  Capitol Hill today, and she didn't know which end was up on the trade issue. So Trump's US trade [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=307.04s)]
*  representative, Jameson Greer, tried to explain to her how trade actually works. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=314.64s)]
*  This formula that the administration used to assign this so-called reciprocal tariff [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=321.6s)]
*  seemed, it just seems so arbitrary. I mean, where did that formula come from? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=326.32s)]
*  It's straightforward and it's common sense. It came from White House economists, and they proposed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=331.68s)]
*  that looking at a country's trade deficit is a good approximation of the net effect of the unfairness [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=335.12s)]
*  of the higher tariff rates, the higher trade barriers, the unfair trade practices, the dumping, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=341.28s)]
*  the subsidies, all of that. And that's how you can capture that. She kept gesticulating and was very [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=345.6s)]
*  confused in this hearing. Now, if these elected officials don't know the basic facts already on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=351.6s)]
*  trade, they should go into a different line of work, frankly. And as for the GOP senators [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=356.72s)]
*  hitting Trump's plan or the Trump advisors throwing darts, look, it can do whatever they want. It's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=361.68s)]
*  obviously their choice and there's disagreements on these issues. That's fine. But I might start [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  worrying when you're being praised by the never Trump crowd as you were today. The bottom line, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=372.24s)]
*  you can only save capitalism if our middle class continues to buy into capitalism. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=379.12s)]
*  But if year after year they're told, well, you've got to sacrifice more, you've got to work harder, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=387.12s)]
*  get another job for less of a return, then why shouldn't they just start voting with a party [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=392.8s)]
*  that's going to give them the most freebies? Where's that going to leave the Republican Party? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=398.64s)]
*  And if the answer for the middle classes, prepare to have your way of life destroyed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=402.96s)]
*  because some Uighur slave can make a product for pennies on the dollar in China, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=408.4s)]
*  or some poor Malaysian worker can assemble the solar panels for three bucks an hour, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=413.2s)]
*  then we shouldn't expect this system, the system that we've gotten used to, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  our capitalist system, we shouldn't expect it's going to be around for much longer anyway. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  And who wants that? And that's the angle. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight we are back in the DC Swamp broadcasting live from inside the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=430.88s)]
*  U.S. Capitol building, where in just a moment we're going to be joined by Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=438.48s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Kennedy, Senator Britt, Senator Graham, Senator Scott, Senator Mark [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=443.6s)]
*  Wayne Mullen, the majority leader himself, John Thune, for a very special Senate town hall. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=450.08s)]
*  And we begin tonight with one word. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you haven't, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=454.96s)]
*  reconciliation. I'm going to spare you the boring, gritty details of what is a rather arcane [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=459.68s)]
*  budgetary but really, really important procedure. But just know that the senators here in this room [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=466.16s)]
*  can in fact pass certain spending and revenue bills with a simple 51 vote majority. No filibuster [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=473.04s)]
*  proof supermajority is needed. Now this could play a significant role in giving Tom Homan the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=480.72s)]
*  tools that he would need to secure our border. That would mean new miles of border wall. That [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=486.56s)]
*  would mean expanded ICE capabilities, additional border patrol agents, the ability to expedite [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=492.08s)]
*  deportations on a large scale. You know, we have known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=498.16s)]
*  and gang members in our country that need to be sent home. Now this could also be used to make [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=504.4s)]
*  President Trump's tax cuts permanent. Otherwise it's going to be a $4 trillion tax increase on you, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=510.0s)]
*  the American people. He can also implement no tax on tips or overtime or social security [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=516.0s)]
*  and even implement certain changes recommended by Doge. That'll eliminate hundreds of billions of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=522.88s)]
*  waste, fraud, abuse and corruption inside of our federal government. And of course, reconciliation [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=529.68s)]
*  might ultimately play a role in President Trump's reciprocal tariff strategy. There is a little [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=535.44s)]
*  disagreement on that issue tonight. We'll get into it. Now tonight for the first time in decades, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=541.44s)]
*  we do have a president that is willing and ready and able to stand up for American industry, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=546.08s)]
*  for the working men and women that truly do make our country great and our interests around the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=552.96s)]
*  globe. No amount of hysteria, no amount of fear-mongering is going to shake the president's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=558.24s)]
*  resolve. As Caroline Levitt very articulately mentioned today, President Trump does have a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  spine of steel. Take a look. On the other hand, countries like China who have chosen to retaliate [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=569.76s)]
*  and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers are making a mistake. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=576.16s)]
*  President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break and America will not break under his [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=580.48s)]
*  leadership. He is guided by a firm belief that America must be able to produce essential goods [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=585.68s)]
*  for our own people and export them to the rest of the world. Now tonight, President Trump's strategy [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=591.12s)]
*  seems to be paying off. Around 70 countries are in talks with the White House to reduce or eliminate [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=598.72s)]
*  tariffs against American goods. So far Israel, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Taiwan, they have all vowed to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=604.64s)]
*  end all tariffs against American-made goods. Meanwhile, the European Union, they have now [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=611.76s)]
*  offered to remove all industrial tariffs. Britain's prime minister publicly admitting that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=616.88s)]
*  globalization is over and now working with the White House on a bilateral free and fair trade deal. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=622.24s)]
*  Also Japan, South Korea, they are already sending a team to Washington, D.C. right here to hammer [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  out their own deal. American products are about to get even more competitive on the world stage [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=636.88s)]
*  and while major multinational companies like Nissan and Honda and Apple along with so many [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=643.04s)]
*  other countries and companies, they're now pledging as of now to invest already an estimated [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=648.64s)]
*  seven trillion dollars in manufacturing plants and other businesses and ventures right here in the U.S. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  Now this is what it looks like when you do have a president who number one keeps his promises, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=662.56s)]
*  is willing to fight, but of course not everybody's happy, especially the communist Chinese. They're [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  not happy. For decades they have benefited from a massive trade imbalance with the U.S. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=672.72s)]
*  They have been hostile to our friends and allies around the world. They have stolen untold hundreds [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=678.4s)]
*  of billions of dollars in intellectual property theft and they are also the most guilty of currency [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=684.64s)]
*  manipulation, high tariffs on U.S. goods and our partnership with China has been a one-way street. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  The president, he has sent a very clear unambiguous message. This is going to end. We send them [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=697.76s)]
*  trillions of dollars. They send us a lot of junk often made in sweatshops and let's not forget about [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=704.24s)]
*  COVID-19, shall we? Now they're retaliatory tariffs. They are hollow in every way. China like the rest [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=710.0s)]
*  of the world and we need to all understand this. They desperately want and need access to American [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=716.88s)]
*  markets. They want your money. The most most American goods have already been blocked in some way from [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=723.04s)]

*  well that could wreck China's already fragile economy. The president knows leverage, but will [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=735.52s)]
*  he get the backing? Will he get the support of the U.S. Senate? Will he get the 51 votes needed for [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=741.3599999999999s)]
*  reconciliation? It's obviously easier said than done, especially there are senators, I won't mention [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  names, that kind of have contempt for President Trump. They want to be opposition voices and they [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  don't really understand how profound and deep this moment is. Anyway, we'll see over time what [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=758.4s)]
*  happens with some of these other senators. So the road ahead is not going to be easy, but so far [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=764.88s)]
*  Senate leadership, they have done an amazing job. They have stuck together. They have navigated [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=770.0799999999999s)]
*  challenge after challenge. They got the president's cabinet through. Remember that giant sucking sound? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. To those of you in the audience who are business people, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=782.56s)]
*  pretty simple. If you're paying 12, 13 dollars, 14 dollars an hour for factory workers [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=789.68s)]
*  and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=794.88s)]
*  have no health care, that's the most expensive single element, making a car, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=798.64s)]
*  have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don't care [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=802.56s)]
*  about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=809.12s)]
*  They called Ross Perot crazy, but after 30 years they call him right. Bubba was wrong. He signed [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=814.0s)]
*  NAFTA and the giant sucking sound came from the south, and then he signed the China deal, and the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=819.68s)]
*  giant sucking sound came from the east. There are a lot of sucking sounds in the 90s, and Chuck was fed up. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=824.64s)]
*  We are fed up, Mr. President. The Chinese should play by the rules once and for all, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  but how can we stand by as millions of American workers lose their jobs, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=837.36s)]
*  as thousands of American companies can't compete fairly? No one seeks political advantage. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=845.04s)]
*  What we seek rather is fairness, fairness in trade. The party that represented workers, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=852.24s)]
*  the Democrats, immediately recognized the giant sucking sound was bad for workers, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=859.2s)]
*  bad for workers, but good for donors. Wall Street got rich off the giant sucking sound, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=863.6s)]
*  and so did Pelosi, Hillary, Kerry Gore, all of them. So they talked about it to win votes, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=869.44s)]
*  but didn't do anything about it, and turned China into a monster, their monster. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=875.2s)]
*  I worked in a factory, went to a factory in 1989. We made radio passenger tires for cars. I worked [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=880.72s)]
*  there with my dad, eight of my uncles, and 12 of my cousins. I was a union steward there. That plant [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=886.64s)]
*  now sits in China because you can import small radio passenger tires pretty cheap because of our [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=891.36s)]
*  failed trade policy in this Democrat's opinion. Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, St. Louis, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=895.6s)]
*  Milwaukee, I could go on and on. They traded jobs in honor for cheap phones and TV screens. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=901.28s)]
*  Trump's declaring an end to the giant sucking sound and decided to slay the monster. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=907.92s)]
*  Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=912.88s)]
*  American workers, are making a mistake. President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=917.44s)]
*  and America will not break under his leadership. When America is punched, he punches back harder. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=923.12s)]
*  That's why there will be 104% tariffs going into effect on China tonight at midnight. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=928.24s)]
*  So when the clock strikes midnight tonight, the battle begins. China will be hit with triple digit [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=934.6400000000001s)]
*  tariffs. The export menace should have never retaliated. Trump believes he has the cards and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=939.36s)]
*  likes his chances. Trump has maximum negotiating leverage right here, right now. And I think it [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=945.04s)]
*  would be a mistake for anyone to think otherwise. I think it was a big mistake, this Chinese [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  escalation. But if you look at the history of the trade negotiations, we are the deficit country. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  So what do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one fifth to them of what they [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=971.12s)]
*  export to us. So that is a losing hand for them. China had a plan. Dump cheap goods into the rest [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=981.52s)]
*  of the world, use the money to build their military, and pass the U.S. as the world's top [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=988.7199999999999s)]
*  superpower. But if China can't dump cheap goods here, and we're the world's biggest market, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  they have nowhere else to sell. They can't sell to Europe. They don't have the consumer power. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=998.64s)]
*  And they can't sell to themselves because their birth rate's cratered. And once China can't sell, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1003.52s)]
*  they have to lay off their workers. And the communists don't want a billion angry, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1009.04s)]
*  unemployed Chinese. That's how regimes get toppled. But we have to let Xi Jinping lose face [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1013.04s)]
*  gracefully. A quick violent death makes us collateral damage. So we have to lower the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1018.88s)]
*  Chinese casket into the ground diplomatically. While Trump's taxing Chinese products, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1024.64s)]
*  he's kicking them out of the hemisphere. Pistol Pete's down at the Panama Canal today, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1030.5600000000002s)]
*  flexing the Monroe Doctrine. The United States of America will not allow communist China [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity. I want to be very clear. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1048.16s)]
*  this canal. China bribed the Bidens. But boy, did they pick the wrong horse. Trump knocked the big [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1056.8s)]
*  guy out. And now he's wrestling their precious TikTok away. And Beijing's on its heels. Breaking [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  China also guts Russia. The Chinese can't fill Putin's shaky economy. So now that Trump's [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  engineered oil down to 60 bucks a barrel, Putin's war machine is going to take a hit. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1076.08s)]
*  Russia's influence in the Mideast is weaker than ever. Their proxy in Syria got picked off. And [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1080.96s)]
*  their other proxy, Iran, as we speak, is surrounded by two U.S. aircraft carriers, the USS Truman and [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1085.52s)]
*  the Vincent. Oh, and we have B-2 bombers waiting at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. While Trump's [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1092.56s)]
*  chief negotiator, Steve Witkoff, starts bargaining with the mullahs. Now if they knock off their nuke [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  program, we can bring Iranian oil back online and drive the energy prices down even lower. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1103.6s)]
*  That'll hurt Putin, bring rates down, and take the edge off any inflation that the trade war triggers. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1109.28s)]
*  And Europe knows where it's bread's buttered. They can't afford their socialist welfare states [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1115.52s)]
*  without the American security blanket. And we're not going to give them that little blanket if they [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1120.16s)]
*  don't drop their tariffs. And they just said they're willing to go down to zero tariffs. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1124.72s)]
*  And if they kill their VAT tax and sprinkle in Greenland, we could have a deal. America [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1130.08s)]
*  dominating the Arctic is necessary for international security. And world peace costs money, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1135.52s)]
*  which is why we need Ukrainian minerals. Who else does the world want on top? Us or China? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1141.52s)]
*  Trump's logic is that China doesn't have the cards and they're bluffing. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  China wants to make a deal badly, but they don't know how to get it started. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1154.72s)]
*  We're waiting for their call. It will happen. And China can't afford to play the long game here [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1158.72s)]
*  because the rest of Asia is racing to negotiate with us. The Chai comms are isolated and they know it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  President Trump made the made it very clear that the era of economic, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1171.6s)]
*  American economic surrender is over. President Trump is no longer going to allow American workers [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1176.8s)]
*  and companies to be ripped off at the hands of foolish trade practices that shipped away millions [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1183.12s)]
*  of high paying jobs and hollowed out communities across the country. Trump could go to China like [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1188.4799999999998s)]
*  Nixon did and rewire the world all over again. Give Chi a soft landing. Let him put out domestic [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1194.1599999999999s)]

*  it's going to end or when it's going to end, but I know every phone at the White House is ringing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1205.28s)]
*  We're managing a massive number of requests for negotiations. It's actually logistically quite [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  challenging just to go through them. It's something that I've been spending a lot of the time this [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1214.96s)]

*  And there are so many to go through that, you know, we're actually getting ready to present [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1224.24s)]
*  a plan for him on, you know, who and when the White House is having to put world leaders on hold. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1228.8000000000002s)]

*  What's a good time to call you back? Hungary is actually going around the EU's back and trying to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1238.56s)]
*  cut a one-on-one deal with us. I didn't even know you were allowed to do that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1243.9199999999998s)]

*  tariffs. But Trump's not just handing out deals willy-nilly. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1253.9199999999998s)]
*  We're taking in almost two billion dollars a day in tariffs. Two billion a day. And we're doing [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1258.0s)]

*  These are tailored, highly tailored deals. Right now, Japan is flying here to make a deal. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1274.1599999999999s)]

*  Now I'm sure there are a few liberals out there watching thinking, this is a bunch of crap. I'm [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1620.0s)]

*  Luigi Mangione. Yeah, you know that guy, don't you? You've probably written him fan mail. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1643.52s)]
*  And those nudes he got from Taylor Lorenz were probably worse than the death penalty. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1649.68s)]

*  of savagery. The scariest people are those who believe your suffering is part of their greater [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=1714.16s)]

*  cool. Right. And now it's like, you know what natural porn killers we do with everything. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2072.56s)]
*  We're like, Oh, Larry David is selfish. And he's, and he's, he just wants to be by himself and he's [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2076.72s)]
*  grumpy and he hates people. And we go, I hate people and I'm grumpy. And you go, well, look, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2081.44s)]
*  why are we rooting for that? Yeah. And also he's really rich and you're not, so you can be grumpy [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2086.0s)]
*  all you want. You're not going to get a TV show. Emily, it's always good to see you. Thanks. Yes. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2091.28s)]
*  Jeff makes a good point. It's like generally if people on the right are religious. So if [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  something bad, if somebody says something bad, they just go, we're going to pray for you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2108.32s)]
*  You know, it's like, that's the reaction that you get from the one side versus the other. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2112.56s)]
*  In part, I think too, the study talked about that the judgment and the like blessing of violence [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2117.6800000000003s)]
*  from the left came from a place of strong moral judgment. And I feel like that it's the judgment [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2123.52s)]
*  that sits with the left because those on the right who are praying for souls, see everyone as everyone [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  is God's children. You are worthy of value, even if I disagree with you. And remember we've seen [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2133.84s)]
*  this reflected in all these different polls, like the ones where they say I needed to break up with [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2138.24s)]
*  a partner because of politics. It's always Lib breaking up with the conservative or I can't have [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2142.4799999999996s)]
*  Thanksgiving dinner with my family. It's the Libs saying that all of the complete isolation [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2148.16s)]
*  or the civic condemnation came from the left. And it's all because they are superior and unable to [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2152.64s)]
*  even stand the presence because they consider it harmful and immoral. And the thing is that we've [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2159.04s)]
*  seen that reflected this entire time. Look, Kamala Harris was historic, but a black American senator [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2164.32s)]
*  running for president, that's Uncle Tom. I mean, we saw it from the mouths of people on the left. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  It's hideous rhetoric that has stoked all of this violence. If from the beginning, the Democratic [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2174.1600000000003s)]
*  leadership had said, none of this is acceptable, then it would have been nipped in the butt a long [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2179.04s)]
*  time ago, but they pat themselves on the back for compassion. Well, compassion is cruel because in [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2184.2400000000002s)]
*  their compassion, they've allowed all of the people at the border, the historic rapes and murders and [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2188.7200000000003s)]
*  the like, but the blood's on their hands. That's the difference. No, Tyrus, it's like, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2192.56s)]
*  that'll help her sleep at night. Tyrus, it's also lazy. You don't have to get to know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2201.2s)]
*  an issue or anything if you just label somebody. There's no honor. Yeah. There's no respect among [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2207.52s)]
*  thieves and their leadership is thieves. So every time the difference between a conservative and a [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2212.64s)]
*  Democrat right now in this particular point in history is the conservative wants to talk about [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2218.48s)]
*  the issues and they feel they have a good grasp on things and like, well, I want to do this and I [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2222.64s)]
*  want lower taxes than this. And the other side is we're on the wrong side of it. So the only thing [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2226.32s)]
*  we can do is the easiest thing to do is to create a monster. That's why you hear Hitler and not a [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2230.96s)]
*  counter proposal. There's a reason for that. You have no argument. There's a reason. Here's the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2236.48s)]
*  cold part for them. And the leadership knows this. When you have activists as leadership, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2245.36s)]
*  when you have a bad pastor who all he cares about is filling the money in the plate, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2249.84s)]
*  he's going to tell you the locusts are coming and he's going to tell you that if you don't build [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  the house for God and me to have this Rolex, bad s*** is going to happen. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2258.6400000000003s)]
*  And so, and then if something happens, well, it's not me, it's the act of God. And they do [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2268.48s)]
*  the same thing. They make promises that they know they can't keep and they continue to rely on the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2273.76s)]
*  part of the community, a part of this country who just watches, who believes the things on TV are [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2279.52s)]
*  real. When they see an actor, they think that's the guy, how he is in real life. And then they [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2286.16s)]
*  meet him and he's not that way. They have they have gotten the people to do the bidding for them. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2290.16s)]
*  They all sit up there and they have this new memo came out where they said to cuss like [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2295.2000000000003s)]
*  Swalwell now says the F word like my kids did when they were three. It doesn't make sense. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2298.8s)]
*  It's funny to hear it, but there's nothing to it. And that's the problem. They don't have [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2304.88s)]
*  any substance to their arguments. So what do they do? They create monsters and president Trump, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2308.96s)]
*  they talk about him as a monster. Okay. President Trump has been in politics [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2313.44s)]
*  for almost 10 years now, right? About 10 years now. How many camps has he built? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2317.44s)]
*  How many people have been [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2322.8799999999997s)]
*  suicided from their homes at night? None of this has ever happened, but they continue to do it [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2325.4399999999996s)]
*  because they have a small population who will do their bidding for them. It would be great for [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2330.3199999999997s)]
*  Trump as if he actually did build camps, but they're like summer camps. Yeah, it's like, yeah, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2334.64s)]
*  yeah, I was at Trump's camp. It's awesome. Yeah, it's fantastic. You want to lose some weight. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2340.9599999999996s)]
*  There's a little fat camp. We golfed a lot. Yes. He should do a press conference where he goes, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2348.24s)]
*  I am going, my executive order, I'm making camps. And then he disrupts his huge pictures. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2354.72s)]
*  Beautiful balloons. There'll be a carnival and pony rides. All right. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2uAKiFEeM&t=2360.64s)]
