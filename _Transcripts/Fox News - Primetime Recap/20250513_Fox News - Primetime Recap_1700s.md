# Fox News Highlights - May 12th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g)
*  The man on the mission. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1.76s)]
*  Now, do y'all remember the mornings [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=5.84s)]
*  when Biden used to call a lid before noon? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=7.72s)]
*  Or when his enablers would shoo reporters out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=11.16s)]
*  after every public event? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=14.14s)]
*  Well, before noon today, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump made more pro-American policy announcements [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=17.96s)]
*  than Biden did in his entire first term. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=21.16s)]
*  And he took more than a dozen questions from the press, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=24.64s)]
*  no note cards. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=27.28s)]
*  Then he got on a plane to Saudi Arabia [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=28.8s)]
*  for meetings with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and others. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=30.92s)]
*  He hinted at a stopover at some point, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=35.28s)]
*  maybe in Turkey, on the Russia-Ukraine issue. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=37.44s)]
*  There's already a meeting set Thursday [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=40.56s)]
*  between those two powers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=42.24s)]
*  Now, I remember when Democrats used to demand peace. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=44.72s)]
*  But now it's Republican President Donald Trump [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=48.92s)]
*  who's the peacemaker. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=52.32s)]
*  I think good things can come out of that meeting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=53.92s)]
*  Stop the bloodshed of the horrible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=57.0s)]
*  It's a bloodbath. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=60.56s)]
*  They're not American soldiers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=61.68s)]
*  They're from Russia, they're from Ukraine, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=62.96s)]
*  but they're people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=64.44s)]
*  They're human souls, and they're being killed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=65.68s)]
*  at levels that we haven't seen since the Second World War. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=68.0s)]
*  We're working very hard to see if we can end that bloodbath. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=71.44s)]
*  Now, this would be good for all sides and better for us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=76.68s)]
*  We do not have another $200 billion to blow there, period. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=79.8s)]
*  End of story. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  But the goal never changes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=85.48s)]
*  Trump wants to put points on the board for America, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=87.48s)]
*  for our people, on domestic, foreign policy, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=91.0s)]
*  all those matters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=94.44s)]
*  Trump 2.0 is acting like an administration [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=95.76s)]
*  operating almost on borrowed time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  What do I mean by that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=100.76s)]
*  They all know that their window for making real change [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=102.48s)]
*  in Washington is narrow, and Trump's a man on a mission. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=105.72s)]
*  Issues that other presidents ignored or even made worse, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=110.12s)]
*  he's diving into them, straight into them, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  like resetting our global trade relationships, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=116.92s)]
*  especially with China. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=119.08s)]
*  But Trump's team met over the weekend with the Chinese, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=121.0s)]
*  and both sides right now see a path forward. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=124.0s)]
*  For at least the next 90 days, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=127.36s)]
*  tariffs are coming down significantly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=128.88s)]
*  But can we really trust that China is going to change its ways? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=132.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're going to follow through. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  I think they want it very badly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=136.88s)]
*  I think they want the deal very badly. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=138.2s)]
*  Again, this doesn't include the steel tariffs [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=140.2s)]
*  that I put on a long time ago [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=142.6s)]
*  that Biden tried to get off, but he couldn't get them off [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=143.84s)]
*  because it was too much money. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=145.76s)]
*  You know, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=147.68s)]
*  which a lot of people don't know, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=150.24s)]
*  but we put on the tariffs originally. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=151.6s)]
*  And if I didn't do that, we wouldn't have a steel industry today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Now we have a thriving steel industry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=155.8s)]
*  It'll be thriving much more with what we're doing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=158.44s)]
*  because this is the next level. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=160.24s)]
*  Well, we know this. Wall Street liked what it saw. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=162.4s)]
*  The stock market jumped more than 1,100 points today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=165.08s)]
*  More on this with Jameson Greer, the U.S. trade rep, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=168.52s)]
*  who was in the negotiations in a few minutes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, there was also good news on the release of Eden Alexander, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  that American hostage held by Hamas for more than 580 days. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump's team has been pressing for his release. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=182.6s)]
*  Now, this is the moment his mother heard his voice on the phone [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=185.48s)]
*  for the first time in over a year. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  They just released a photo of you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=192.04s)]
*  You look unbelievable. Wow. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=194.32s)]
*  You look beautiful. I love you so much. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  And I'm going to see you, like, soon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=199.16s)]
*  Ah! [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=201.68s)]
*  Well, they were celebrating in Israel and in Teneflay, New Jersey, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=210.08s)]
*  where his family is from. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=213.68s)]
*  Now, Trump has made bringing home all of our prisoners [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=216.76s)]
*  held unfairly by foreign countries a top priority. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=220.28s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=224.12s)]
*  And then there's the small matter of Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=225.8s)]
*  helping to prevent a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=227.84s)]
*  We helped also with trade. I said, come on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=232.28s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  Let's stop it. Let's stop it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  If you stop it, we're doing trade. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=240.08s)]
*  If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=241.44s)]
*  People have never really used trade the way I used it, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  that I can tell you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they said, I think we're going to stop. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=248.52s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=250.84s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of trade with India. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  We're negotiating with India right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  We're going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=256.88s)]
*  And we stopped the nuclear conflict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=259.96s)]
*  I think it would have, it could have been a bad nuclear war. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=261.68s)]
*  Again, could Biden or Harris have exerted any of this pressure? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=265.64s)]
*  They wouldn't even know where to start. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=270.64s)]
*  And their answer would have been something like, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=272.68s)]
*  we're going to convene the UN Security Council [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  for a meaningless vote on this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=277.8s)]
*  Now, finally, perhaps most important, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=280.2s)]
*  the most important move by Trump today [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  was against the obscene prices Americans pay [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=284.44s)]
*  for prescription drugs versus the rest of the world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=287.0s)]
*  Pharma's probably going to take them to court over this, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=290.4s)]
*  but if this executive order survives legal scrutiny, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=292.68s)]
*  get ready to save a lot of money. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=295.6s)]
*  More on this coming up with FDA Commissioner Marty McCary. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=298.24s)]
*  But all of these big issues, taxes, deregulation, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=302.64s)]
*  the cost of living, energy, the border, the pursuit of peace, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=306.72s)]
*  the push for more investment in manufacturing in America, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=311.08s)]
*  look, Trump is firing on all cylinders. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=314.32s)]
*  Not everything may work out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=317.64s)]
*  Not everything is always supported by a majority in Congress. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=319.8s)]
*  But no one, and I mean no one can doubt [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=323.4s)]
*  that we have a president who is trying with everything he has, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=327.2s)]
*  pushing his staff 24-7, and he pushes them, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=330.76s)]
*  to deliver results for the American people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=334.08s)]
*  Just think of where we were a year ago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=337.32s)]
*  The contrast could not be clearer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=344.32s)]
*  I hope everybody had a great Mother's Day weekend. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=345.32s)]
*  But if you drank too much of brunch, you missed a lot. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=347.48s)]
*  In four days, we got about four years of action. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=350.36s)]
*  Trump signed a trade deal with Great Britain, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=353.24s)]
*  then brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=355.28s)]
*  freed the final American hostage from Hamas, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=358.32s)]
*  slash drug prices, and now he's on the way [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=361.28s)]
*  to the Middle East. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  But China was the big kahuna. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=365.0s)]
*  Yesterday we achieved a total reset with China. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  After productive talks in Geneva, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=372.24s)]
*  both sides now agreed to reduce the tariffs imposed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=375.36s)]
*  after April 2nd to 10% for 90 days [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=379.16s)]
*  as negotiators continue on the larger structural issues. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  So we were in a toxic relationship with the Chinese. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=387.24s)]
*  We got hooked on their cheap junk. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  And it was making us needy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=392.56s)]
*  You never wanna be the needy one in a relationship. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=394.12s)]
*  It's not healthy for you or the other person. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  So we're letting them down easy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  Besant took the Chinese to a secluded Swiss villa [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=401.28s)]
*  overlooking Lake Geneva and locked the door. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  Scott Swee talked them for about 14 hours [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=407.84s)]
*  and then convinced them that it was their idea to break up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=410.2s)]
*  We can still be friends, but we need some space. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=413.55999999999995s)]
*  I would say one of the big takeaways from this weekend, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=417.32s)]
*  the United States will continue a strategic rebalancing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=423.64s)]
*  in many areas that were exposed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=429.64s)]
*  as supply chain weaknesses during COVID. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  The consensus from both delegations this weekend [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=437.64s)]
*  is neither side wants a decoupling. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=441.36s)]
*  America is gonna take some time and focus on ourselves [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=445.8s)]
*  because the way things were going, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=449.2s)]
*  we were being taken advantage of. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=450.8s)]
*  In January, 2020, President Trump produced a template [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=453.36s)]
*  we had an excellent trade agreement with China [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=457.76s)]
*  and the Biden administration chose not to enforce it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=464.08s)]
*  The Chinese delegation basically told us [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=467.76s)]
*  that once President Biden came into office, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=470.08s)]
*  they just ignored their obligations. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=473.12s)]
*  So China had a four year hall pass [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=475.76s)]
*  because our president was in a brain fog. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=477.92s)]
*  Or did Joe let it slide because Hunter got bribed? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=480.56s)]
*  The stock market loved the good news. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=484.44s)]
*  The stock price doused up over a thousand points. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=485.96s)]
*  It's higher now than it was before liberation day. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  Now the Panicons understand the art of the deal. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  This to me is a signal that there is maybe [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  a different kind of President Trump happening. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=498.68s)]
*  President Trump seems to be looking [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=500.52s)]
*  for less confrontational style. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=502.24s)]
*  And this may be the beginning of what I regard [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  as being kind of a little more politics as usual, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  not for Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=511.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=513.24s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  We're still keeping 25% tariffs on key industries [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=515.2s)]
*  like steel, aluminum, automobiles and pharmaceuticals. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  COVID taught us we can't rely on China during a crisis. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=521.12s)]
*  Everyone's been beating on us like a pinata, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=524.76s)]
*  watching the candy fall out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=527.2s)]
*  We've been paying more for prescriptions [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=529.24s)]
*  while the rest of the world got them cheap. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=531.0s)]
*  Starting today, the United States will no longer [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  subsidize the healthcare of foreign countries [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  and will no longer tolerate profiteering [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=538.96s)]
*  and price gouging from big pharma. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=541.1600000000001s)]
*  What we're doing is equalizing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=543.76s)]
*  There's a new word that I came up with, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=545.24s)]
*  which I think is probably the best word. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=546.8s)]
*  We're gonna equalize. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=548.28s)]
*  We're all gonna pay the same. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=549.96s)]
*  We're gonna pay what Europe's gonna pay. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=551.56s)]
*  We're gonna all pay. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=553.24s)]
*  It's called most favorite nation. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=554.08s)]
*  We are gonna pay the lowest price there is in the world. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=555.76s)]
*  Democrats like equity. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=559.08s)]
*  They should like equalizing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=560.68s)]
*  That comes out to about an 80% discount for a lot of drugs. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=562.68s)]
*  Even the ones that make you lose weight. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=566.04s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a business man, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=568.8s)]
*  very, very, very top guy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=572.24s)]
*  Most of you would have heard of him. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  A highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=576.44s)]
*  seriously overweight, and he takes the fat shot drug. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=580.36s)]
*  And he called me up and he said, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=586.76s)]
*  President, could I ask you a question? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=589.2s)]
*  What? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=590.8s)]
*  I'm in London and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=591.62s)]
*  I said, it's not working. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=596.44s)]
*  He said, he said, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=598.32s)]
*  I just paid $88 and in New York, I paid $1,300. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=600.6s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=607.24s)]
*  Big Pharma's not happy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=609.32s)]
*  Their lobbyists are fuming. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  And whatever happened to the politicians they greased? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=612.32s)]
*  President Trump was taking money [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  from the pharmaceutical industry too. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  I think they gave you $100 million. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=619.48s)]
*  But he can't be bought, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=622.32s)]
*  unlike most of the politicians in this country. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=624.0s)]
*  There has never been a president more willing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=626.7600000000001s)]
*  to stand up to the oligarchs than President Donald Trump. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=631.04s)]
*  Trump should put the drug pricing in the big, beautiful bill, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=635.24s)]
*  force Democrats to vote against cheaper prescriptions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=638.24s)]
*  They can run ads against Democrats in the midterms. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=641.32s)]
*  I cut your taxes and prescription costs. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=643.64s)]
*  Democrats voted against it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=646.12s)]
*  Between cutting trade deals, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=648.44s)]
*  the White House stopped a nuclear war. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=649.84s)]
*  On Saturday, my administration helped broker a full [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=652.72s)]
*  and immediate ceasefire, I think a permanent one, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=656.36s)]
*  between India and Pakistan, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=659.8399999999999s)]
*  ending a dangerous conflict of two nations [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=661.52s)]
*  with lots of nuclear weapons. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=665.04s)]
*  Two major wars kicked off under Joe Biden [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=667.4s)]
*  because he wasn't throwing America's weight around [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=669.56s)]
*  when other countries got frisky. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=671.64s)]
*  It's a lot safer and cheaper for everyone [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=673.7199999999999s)]
*  if we prevent wars instead of funding them later. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=675.88s)]
*  Trump's working on settling those too. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=679.5999999999999s)]
*  He just freed the last living American hostage from Hamas. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm very happy to announce that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=686.36s)]
*  Edan Alexander, an American citizen who, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=690.84s)]
*  until recently most thought was no longer living, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  thought was dead, is going to be released [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=698.0s)]
*  in about two hours, actually. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=702.2s)]
*  The president's on his way to the Middle East, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=704.36s)]
*  and he's got one thing on his mind. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=706.08s)]
*  Quote, all three countries have a ton of money. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=708.48s)]
*  It's really that simple. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=712.6s)]
*  Trump's looking to come home with over a trillion dollars [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=714.76s)]
*  in investments, but it's not just money. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=717.48s)]
*  Trump wants the Arab countries [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=719.96s)]
*  to put their neighbors in check, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=721.28s)]
*  the Houthis, Hamas, and Iran. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=723.12s)]
*  And he wants Saudi Arabia to get along with Israel. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=725.36s)]
*  We expect a lot of big news out of this trip. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  The president goes on an international trip. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=731.6s)]
*  The staff in advance secretly arranges [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=734.08s)]
*  what are called deliverables [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  so that the trip is pre-baked as a success [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=738.2s)]
*  because they have in their pocket [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=740.44s)]
*  some things they know they're gonna announce. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=741.84s)]
*  My understanding is this trip is filled with deliverables. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=743.16s)]
*  There are more deliverables on this trip [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  than white good and plenty and a box of good and plenty. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=749.8s)]
*  Although the trip is focused on economics, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=752.36s)]
*  watch for a potential mega diplomatic deliverable. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=754.8399999999999s)]
*  You heard it here first, I think. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=759.9599999999999s)]

*  but there may be a very big diplomatic deliverable. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=762.92s)]
*  This is a make or break year for President Trump. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=765.64s)]
*  He doesn't get another shot another this term. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=767.64s)]
*  Well, unless he, nevermind. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=770.52s)]
*  Every peace deal brokered, every investment announced, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  every trade pact signed creates a sense of destiny, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=776.68s)]
*  unstoppable momentum that could make his second term [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=780.0s)]
*  the most transformational years of this century. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=783.4s)]
*  His intentions are good, better jobs, world peace, less waste. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=786.4s)]
*  Everyone should be for that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=790.6s)]
*  If he succeeds, the country will be much better off. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  This isn't about left or right. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=795.6s)]
*  All Americans should root for these victories. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=797.36s)]
*  And remember, don't be a panicking. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=800.1999999999999s)]

*  No. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=813.56s)]
*  True, his qualifications include previously being laid to rest. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=814.4s)]
*  All right, it was unnecessary. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=827.76s)]
*  Earlier today a jury was sworn in for the trial of Sean Diddy Combs. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=830.32s)]
*  Apparently they took an oath while placing their right hand [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=835.5600000000001s)]

*  Did that make sense? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=864.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=865.68s)]
*  All right, monologue time. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=867.12s)]

*  Take the Dems resident twerp DNC Vice Chair David Hogg, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=878.48s)]
*  who actually said something true on Bill Maher. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=882.24s)]
*  Younger men, they would rather vote for somebody who feels who, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  even if they don't completely agree with, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=889.3599999999999s)]
*  they don't feel judged by it, than somebody who they do agree with, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=890.92s)]
*  that they feel like they have to walk on eggshells around constantly [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=893.56s)]

*  Ultimately what we have to do here is figure out how to bring people back in [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=899.0s)]
*  and work towards the bigger goal of advancing the future of this country. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=902.8399999999999s)]
*  Young people should be able to focus on what young people should be focused on, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=905.3199999999999s)]

*  Not going to happen. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=930.6s)]
*  But even the loudest, most annoying voices in the party are chiming in. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=933.08s)]
*  Here's Jasmine Crockett auditioning for a job at Frontier Air. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=938.92s)]

*  Like, let's go find the safest white boy we can find. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=951.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm just saying. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=953.9599999999999s)]
*  No, for real. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=954.76s)]
*  A white man's got to do it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=955.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  We're getting those callers. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=956.8s)]
*  For real. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=957.52s)]
*  And to be clear, when we talk about them, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=958.3599999999999s)]
*  I can tell you that there is one specific candidate. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=961.0s)]
*  I had a donor on the phones with me telling me [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=964.4799999999999s)]
*  that all the donors are lining up behind that candidate. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=967.44s)]
*  So I can tell you, and I can tell you, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  it's not a black person nor woman. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  Thanks, darling. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=975.2s)]
*  The money's on the dresser. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=975.96s)]
*  So now, I don't know what that means either. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=979.48s)]
*  So now the left knows they must change. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=985.32s)]
*  Some already are. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=987.7600000000001s)]
*  Do you remember this lady? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=989.48s)]
*  That's Stephanie Ruhle before Trump. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=991.08s)]
*  Cute. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=994.48s)]
*  This is her now. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=995.64s)]
*  Who does she remind you of? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=999.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1003.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  If I were Rachel, I'd be kind of worried. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1004.76s)]
*  It reminds me of that stalker movie, Single White Female, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  except it's single white male. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1011.36s)]
*  But what does this tell you? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1015.08s)]
*  With Trump ruling the road of common sense, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1016.84s)]
*  the Dems can only move more left. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1019.6s)]
*  Ruhle wasn't always a left-wing scold. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1022.36s)]
*  She spent 14 years in finance. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1024.88s)]
*  Now she's mostly worried about the price of cats. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1026.88s)]
*  Because she's, you know. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1031.0s)]
*  My guess is Jen Psaki's next. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1032.2s)]
*  By the second episode of her new show, Ratings in the Key Demo, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1037.2s)]
*  people 24 to 54 plunged, with 65,000 in the entire country [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  tuning in. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1045.2800000000002s)]
*  I could get that many reading Kilmeade's book on my OnlyFans. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1046.5200000000002s)]
*  So how long before Jen Psaki goes from this to this? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1050.6s)]
*  Because the Dems, they can't return to normal. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1055.32s)]
*  On Friday, three Democrats stormed an ICE facility in Newark. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1060.32s)]
*  Even the city's lefty mayor was arrested. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess he knows that jail is safer [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1067.76s)]
*  than the streets of Newark. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1069.52s)]
*  But these are the responses to Trump. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  Theater, outrage, screaming. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  No wonder Dems have decided they need ideas. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1077.24s)]
*  But first they need ideas on coming up with ideas. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  And then you're going to need ideas for that too. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1084.04s)]
*  You know, ideas that would lead them to ideas, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1086.04s)]
*  that would help them figure out ideas to create ideas. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1088.04s)]
*  It's an infinite regress with each move, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  depending on a precursor. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1093.56s)]
*  There's no bottom to their problem, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1096.04s)]
*  because a bottom needs a floor, a foundational set [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1097.96s)]
*  of first principles. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1100.8s)]
*  That would mean you have to say there's a core principle [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  That would mean you have to say there's a culture [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1105.52s)]
*  with norms and traditions, rights and wrongs. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1107.52s)]
*  But the Dems are that elevator shaft with no elevator in it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1111.56s)]
*  Whatever idea they have immediately falls [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1115.0s)]
*  60 stories into the abyss. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1117.16s)]
*  Now we have a bottom that's easy to express. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1120.0s)]
*  Law and order, safety and security, free markets [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1122.96s)]
*  based on a fair share of transfer of commodities. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1126.0s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1129.56s)]
*  I did that in 30 seconds. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't even have to look up from my online kangaroo porn. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1132.8s)]
*  But if you lack foundational principles, you're screwed. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1139.56s)]
*  Sadly, the Dems embraced a mind virus [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1143.32s)]
*  that deemed such principles oppressive. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1145.52s)]
*  And now without the foundation, they're [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1148.28s)]
*  trying to build a house on quicksand. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1149.8s)]
*  And any crackpot idea can take hold. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1152.0s)]
*  How did trans hysteria find root in their party? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1154.64s)]
*  How did squatting and mass theft become acceptable? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1157.48s)]
*  Why did the Dems circle their wagons around a gangbanger? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1160.48s)]
*  How did Hamas become sympathetic? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1163.68s)]
*  How did minor attracted persons stop meaning [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1165.88s)]
*  you wanted to bang coal miners? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1169.56s)]
*  Look at how climate change just disappeared [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1175.0800000000002s)]
*  like the ice caps were supposed to 30 years ago. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1177.8s)]
*  I guess when you say the planet's [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1181.0s)]

*  I haven't seen a man abuse a woman like that [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1345.56s)]

*  That's what you call a callback. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1354.68s)]
*  Colby, welcome to the show. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1356.64s)]
*  We asked this question. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1358.76s)]
*  We asked this question almost every night. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1360.48s)]
*  Why are the Dems losing men? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1364.2s)]
*  You're in the MMA. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1366.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you have an opinion on this. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1368.68s)]
*  They're just a bunch of betas. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1372.68s)]
*  They don't like alpha men. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1374.0400000000002s)]
*  They don't like toxic masculinity anymore. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1375.0800000000002s)]
*  They want to demasculize men. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1377.0s)]
*  And it's just, it's not right. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1378.96s)]
*  That's why a lot of the alpha males [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1380.3600000000001s)]
*  are leaving the Dem party. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1382.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just the alpha. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1383.88s)]
*  So most men are. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1385.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, Jamie left. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1387.12s)]
*  He's not an alpha male. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1388.2s)]
*  He's more, you're more like Zeta. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1389.24s)]
*  Yeah, Gamma. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1393.04s)]
*  Gamma, maybe Gamma. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  He's an assistant to the assistant alpha male. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1395.72s)]
*  It's my dog. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1398.24s)]
*  Is there any way, could you see, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1400.72s)]
*  like, guys returning to the party? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1403.48s)]
*  No. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1406.68s)]
*  They've gone so far, Lunatic left, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1407.8s)]
*  there's no returning. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1410.72s)]
*  The DEI circus stuff that they're parading around [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1411.56s)]
*  and trying to rally behind is just, it's unacceptable. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1414.56s)]
*  And it's anti-American. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1417.6799999999998s)]
*  And that's why no alpha male will ever [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1419.28s)]
*  return to that beta party. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1421.24s)]
*  The beta party. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1423.8s)]
*  The master beta party. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1425.6799999999998s)]
*  Emily, they're struggling for ideas. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1427.12s)]
*  But to have ideas, you got to have some basic principles. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1432.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'm trying to think, what is the basic principle [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  of the modern Democrat party? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1438.76s)]
*  And I can only think of power. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1440.56s)]
*  That they see everything through the prism [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1442.6799999999998s)]
*  of power, like, that's what identity politics was. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  If you are of this intersectionality, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1447.08s)]
*  you have more power than this person. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  Is there any other principle? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1452.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what other principle there is. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1453.6799999999998s)]
*  I agree, because it's application. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  I would say, yes, control. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1457.28s)]
*  And then the application of that, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1458.9199999999998s)]
*  their strategy is resist. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1460.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, I was on the West Coast this weekend, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  and someone had a huge- Good for you. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1464.52s)]
*  Someone had a huge chalkboard as their garage door, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1466.1999999999998s)]
*  so people walking by could make art. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1470.04s)]
*  And of course, there was someone that wrote a huge resist. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1471.56s)]
*  And then people after that said, who? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1474.16s)]
*  And what? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1476.4s)]
*  And how? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1477.24s)]
*  And that's exactly the question [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  that these Dems aren't answering. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  So for example, all those lawmakers, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1480.52s)]
*  and by the way, that was a female [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1482.3200000000002s)]
*  lawmaker that body slammed. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1484.16s)]
*  Like, I know it's a- What? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1486.8000000000002s)]
*  He's even confused, but yeah, exactly. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1488.4s)]
*  Like, that's- What do they identify as? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1490.04s)]
*  I mean, who cares? She's fat, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1491.68s)]
*  so I assume it's a they. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1492.92s)]
*  Totally. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1494.52s)]
*  But the whole point is that they're provoking, right? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1495.3600000000001s)]
*  They provoke to get arrested, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1499.64s)]
*  so they have that notch on their belts. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1501.44s)]
*  But then they cry that it's a dictatorship [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1504.6000000000001s)]
*  because who else would actually arrest lawmakers? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1506.2800000000002s)]
*  And the irony that I find hilarious [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1509.1200000000001s)]
*  is that they actually have oversight. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1511.0400000000002s)]
*  And I said, you know, if you guys had just requested a tour, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1512.5600000000002s)]
*  you would've- Yes, they could have had a tour. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1515.24s)]
*  Yeah, doors are open for you anytime. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1516.92s)]
*  But when you break in and you body slam ICE agents, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1518.76s)]
*  then yeah, your ass is gonna get arrested [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1522.0s)]
*  because mess around and find out. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1523.2800000000002s)]
*  And it reminded me of when we covered [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1524.48s)]
*  the Burning Man protests, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1525.96s)]
*  the shock of the protestors who were sleeping [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1527.88s)]
*  on the freeway and being like removed forcefully. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1530.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1533.32s)]
*  And what do you think is gonna happen? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  The consequences are real. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1535.04s)]
*  So right now, all they're doing is having a tantrum [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1536.8s)]
*  to try to claw back that control that you talked about. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1539.28s)]
*  Tyrus, they could have had a tour, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1542.72s)]
*  but they wouldn't have got the press. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1544.24s)]
*  They didn't come for no damn tour. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1545.3999999999999s)]
*  They came for exactly that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1547.12s)]
*  We're gonna do some dumb, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1549.1599999999999s)]
*  the people who could lose their jobs [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1550.76s)]
*  are not gonna risk their jobs. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1552.36s)]
*  So they're gonna be the toughest guy in the room [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1553.96s)]
*  because they know security's not gonna hurt them. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1555.6s)]
*  So it's just more, this is, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1557.96s)]

*  And I was like, I couldn't believe it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1569.44s)]
*  He's not. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1570.84s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1571.68s)]
*  They mean to tell me, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1574.12s)]
*  cause you would like that to where the only thing [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1575.08s)]
*  that young people are thinking about [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1576.8s)]
*  is getting laid and have fun. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1578.6s)]

*  You just work your ass off. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1583.08s)]
*  You get to a point, fellas, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1584.2s)]
*  once you get the whip in a little pocket in your ATM, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1586.04s)]
*  you get laid a lot. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1589.12s)]

*  You're absolutely right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1591.8s)]

*  He missed the whole boat. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1598.32s)]
*  I guess what he's trying to say is, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1599.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm tired of these women telling us, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1601.1599999999999s)]
*  he said, well, you know what, why don't you beat a man? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1603.0s)]
*  Beat a man up, but that's not the only way this works. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is a lot like someone trying to give dating tips [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1608.12s)]
*  to a cat lady. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1610.4799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1611.52s)]
*  Okay? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1613.0s)]
*  It took a long time for her to get there. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1613.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1615.84s)]
*  Okay, it's not one thing that's gonna get her out. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1616.6799999999998s)]
*  You feel where I'm going here? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1618.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1622.48s)]
*  The Democratic party, the only way it works [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1624.32s)]
*  is mass resignations. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1626.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1628.32s)]
*  You have to get rid of all of them, her, him included. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1629.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1632.36s)]
*  They're not, because they're fake, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1633.2s)]
*  they are part of the problem. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1635.72s)]
*  They all benefited during the four years [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1638.28s)]
*  of shadow government. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1640.6s)]
*  They're the shadow government posing as Democrats. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1641.84s)]
*  The only way is for all of them, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1644.44s)]
*  one, confess their crimes and leave [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1646.0s)]
*  and never come back to government again. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1649.2s)]
*  They won't do that, so they come out with stupid ass, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1650.92s)]
*  like on Bill Maher's dumb ass show going, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1653.52s)]
*  well, all we have to do is convince guys [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1655.52s)]
*  that we're not assholes. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1658.48s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1660.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter how you do it, how you change it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1660.8400000000001s)]
*  They're corrupt, America sees it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1663.64s)]
*  There's only one way, a massive clean out. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1665.64s)]
*  And they're not willing to let go of power. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1667.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1670.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1672.16s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rotqzs7hc8g&t=1673.0s)]
