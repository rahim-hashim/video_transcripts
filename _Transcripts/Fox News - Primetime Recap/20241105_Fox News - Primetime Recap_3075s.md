# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 4, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from New York City on Election Eve. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is about to take the stage [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=5.24s)]
*  for his final rally in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=7.68s)]
*  his second to the last one of the entire campaign, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=10.28s)]
*  and we're all over it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=12.4s)]
*  Plus, Donald Trump Jr. is here exclusively [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=13.48s)]
*  to tell us about his dad's final pitch to voters. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=16.12s)]
*  But first, America's time for choosing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=19.28s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  All right, hours before the polls open, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=24.64s)]
*  this long, very strange campaign is almost finished. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=26.52s)]
*  Now, for many reasons, the angle is feeling very positive tonight, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=30.96s)]
*  and so should you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=35.04s)]
*  Now, even though I've known Donald Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=36.52s)]
*  for, I cannot believe I'm saying this, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=38.8s)]
*  25 years, long before he ever got into politics, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=40.32s)]
*  I don't believe I have ever admired him [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=45.2s)]
*  as much as I do right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=47.8s)]
*  Now, what you've witnessed these past few years [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=50.2s)]
*  you will never see again in American politics, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Trump's level of sheer grit, energy, and endurance, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=55.64s)]
*  and you bet his fighting spirit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=60.92s)]
*  Now, we all remember that fateful July day [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=74.16s)]
*  with blood running down his face. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=76.36s)]
*  He pumped his fist and shouted, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=78.64s)]
*  Fight, fight, fight, seeing on T-shirts and hats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=80.16s)]
*  But he said that not just because he wanted [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=83.16s)]
*  to show the country that he was OK, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=84.8s)]
*  but because he wanted all of us to be OK, too, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=87.2s)]
*  and to stay strong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=90.28s)]
*  And we will, because we have him fighting for us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=91.88s)]
*  Tonight, he'll promise us, as your president, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=96.28s)]
*  I will fight for you every single day [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  with every breath in my body. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=102.16s)]
*  We just got the excerpts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=104.92s)]
*  And to think that Harris and Barack Obama routinely [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=106.88s)]
*  try to accuse him of only caring about himself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=111.32s)]
*  Now, America, we stand at a fork in the road. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=116.96s)]
*  The choice we make tomorrow will have a profound effect [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=120.0s)]
*  on the future of our country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  This isn't just any presidential election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  No way. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  Other than perhaps Reagan versus Carter in 1980, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=127.16s)]
*  this is the most important election of the last 50 years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=130.16s)]
*  And the choice is very simple. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=134.2s)]
*  Peace and prosperity under Donald Trump, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=136.16s)]
*  or war and decline under Kamala Harris. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=139.56s)]
*  Now, I'm optimistic because this movement to reclaim America [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=143.56s)]
*  is growing by the day. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  You've seen it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=148.24s)]
*  We've witnessed it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  The voters are informed, and they're voting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=150.68s)]
*  We're moving forward by voting for Donald J. Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=154.0s)]
*  to bring this economy back on track. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  We are voting on policy and convictions [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  that we ultimately hold deeply. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that his economic policy is very sound. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=163.36s)]
*  My biggest priority is my family. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=165.96s)]
*  I have three children. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=168.08s)]
*  And if our economy doesn't change, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  it's going to be a hard candy Christmas this year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=171.68s)]
*  Hard candy Christmas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=174.4s)]
*  Now, the question is, does the government of the United States [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  still belong to us? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=179.24s)]
*  Or are we just supposed to sit down, shut up, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  and take orders from the government? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=183.4s)]
*  So once every four years, the power brokers in DC, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  they have to pay attention to you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  So I suggest you make it matter. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  If enough voters turn out for Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  and support his political movement, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=196.24s)]
*  then we can change everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=198.12s)]
*  His economic policy will put working people first. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=200.68s)]
*  We will secure our borders, and we will also [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=205.0s)]
*  rescue our economy, because our economy is in a mess. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=209.12s)]
*  And I've seen it for a long time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm very good at that stuff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Four years of Kamala have delivered nothing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=218.84s)]
*  but economic hell for American workers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=221.86s)]
*  I think, actually, that could be an understatement. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=224.52s)]
*  Now, we can have also a foreign policy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=226.84s)]
*  that actually puts America's interest ahead [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=229.08s)]
*  of the international order. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=232.24s)]
*  We gave you the largest tax cuts in history, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=234.12s)]
*  the largest regulation cuts in history, rebuilt our military, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=236.24s)]
*  defeated ISIS, had no new wars. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=239.8s)]
*  I will end the war in Ukraine, which would have never [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  started if I was president. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=245.28s)]
*  And I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes, an end to war. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=252.64s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=253.92s)]
*  We can have a country where Christians and other people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=255.48s)]
*  of faith will not be considered enemies of the state. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=258.0s)]
*  We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=262.56s)]
*  the hell out of our schools. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=267.2s)]
*  And we will keep men out of women's sports. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=272.12s)]
*  My driver today, who's happened to be from Mauritania, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  actually brought that up to me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=278.76s)]
*  He didn't talk about the economy, the border. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=280.28s)]
*  It was that issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=282.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, right now, the swamp dwellers, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  I think they're trembling in Washington, DC. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  The race is a toss up, according to the polls. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=289.88s)]
*  It's anyone's guess. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=290.38s)]
*  But it's all because of patriots across the United States [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=291.68s)]
*  who refuse to give up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  They refuse to give in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  Like Trump, it's fight, fight, fight. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is why Harris's machine has done everything [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  in its power over the past four months [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=303.48s)]
*  to scare you into accepting the status quo. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=305.56s)]
*  So it's nonstop lying about Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=308.6s)]
*  That's why I call her Kamala now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=310.4s)]
*  And of course, as supporters, they've [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=312.52s)]
*  been under fire as well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=314.08s)]
*  And it's been their strategy since 2015. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=315.44s)]
*  Why do they do this? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, they do this because they can't promise you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  or your children or your grandchildren [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=322.08s)]
*  that any of you are going to have a better future. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Because of course, they can't deliver on that promise. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=326.56s)]
*  Because in Kamala's America, tonight, young couples [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=329.52s)]
*  are struggling to buy homes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=333.4s)]
*  Food banks lines are growing in swing states [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=338.88s)]
*  And we certainly know they don't care about your safety. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=342.4s)]

*  Poor thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=354.84s)]
*  Now look, Harris's overlords know their policies [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=356.56s)]

*  We know those. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=365.36s)]

*  Certainly not the one we once were. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=372.32s)]

*  Bogus civil suits, two impeachment trials. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=389.76s)]
*  Of course, his family has been threatened. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=393.68s)]
*  Staffers put in jail because they want us to learn. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=395.92s)]

*  He kept going. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=418.72s)]
*  He never stopped. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=419.76s)]
*  It is a time for choosing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  With Trump, we return to having a vibrant, free, growing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=423.72s)]
*  American system that puts us first. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=427.36s)]
*  And with Harris, we stick with the status quo, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=429.6s)]
*  with more decline, lower living standards, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=432.72s)]
*  and more cultural despair. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=435.32s)]
*  So tonight, more Americans are recognizing [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=437.92s)]
*  that Harris's campaign is overwhelmingly [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=440.32s)]
*  driven by hate, pessimism, and vengeance. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=443.76s)]
*  She spent more time lying about Trump [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=448.2s)]
*  than showing us the way out of the mess she created. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump agenda is full of love, hope, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  and optimism for the future. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  And in the end, love Trump's hate, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=459.16s)]
*  which should mean that tomorrow night, Trump trumps Harris. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=462.48s)]

*  Kamala claims she's confident. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=475.24s)]

*  and rural voters showing up big. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=710.56s)]
*  The Democrats are counting on a big turnout [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=713.72s)]
*  on election day, which historically [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  rarely happens for them. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=718.9200000000001s)]
*  They're relying on enthusiasm tomorrow, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  but we haven't seen any enthusiasm so far [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  show up in their early vote. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=725.88s)]
*  And it has David Axelrod worried. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=727.88s)]
*  So what I'm worried about is how are, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  you're counting on some women who are independent, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=734.6800000000001s)]
*  Republican women to come out and vote for Harris. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=739.0s)]
*  Is that gonna materialize? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=743.2s)]
*  Is the gender gap gonna be what you need it to be? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  Are minority voters gonna come out in the numbers [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  of African-American voters in particular, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  and are you gonna get the margins that you want there? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=752.72s)]
*  So there are a lot of open questions. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=756.6400000000001s)]
*  This race is filled with uncertainty. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  Republicans worked their tails off [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=762.76s)]
*  registering new voters and putting together [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=764.36s)]
*  a ground game over the last few years. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=766.44s)]
*  And we're already starting to see the results. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=768.84s)]
*  The polls say the race is tied, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=771.32s)]
*  but there's still a lot we don't know. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=773.96s)]
*  I think the pollsters are getting this wrong. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  We're all missing something because they're giving us [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=778.2s)]
*  the same poll over and over again. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  They're telling us we're watching a basketball game [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=783.32s)]
*  where every plays a jump ball. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=785.44s)]
*  Somewhere, somebody is missing something. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  I think there's, I'm not gonna call it a wave, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=790.36s)]
*  but I think there's a wavelet out there [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  of Republican enthusiasm and registration. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  Wall Street, who pays guys millions of dollars [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=799.0s)]
*  to know things before they happen, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=801.44s)]
*  is seeing the same thing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=803.12s)]
*  The expectation today is that Donald Trump [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=805.36s)]
*  will win the White House in just a few days. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=807.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll know shortly. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  Wall Street isn't always right though, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=811.8800000000001s)]
*  but even our good friend Chuck Todd [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=813.96s)]
*  is predicting a Trump win. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=815.8800000000001s)]
*  This is not the beginning of something [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=818.12s)]
*  nor the end of something. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=819.2800000000001s)]
*  We continue to be in the middle of something. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=820.12s)]
*  We are about to do something we haven't done [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  since the 19th century, and that is have two, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=823.6s)]
*  we just finished two straight one-term presidents. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=826.0s)]
*  The likelihood of this being a one-term presidency [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=828.32s)]
*  is high, not low, because we are a country [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=831.0s)]
*  that has been voting against. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=833.08s)]
*  We voted against Hillary Clinton in 16 and got Trump. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  We voted against Trump in 20 and got Biden. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=837.1600000000001s)]
*  I think this is another vote against election, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  not a vote for. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=841.64s)]
*  This race really started with the raid. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=843.2s)]
*  Biden sending the FBI to turn Trump's house upside down, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=845.48s)]
*  rallied the Republican party around him. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  After that, it was overkill. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=850.96s)]
*  Indictment after indictment after indictment. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=852.44s)]
*  Even a mugshot. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=855.24s)]
*  Then unconstitutionally excessive fines [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=856.84s)]
*  and a six-week show trial. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=859.48s)]
*  Trump's numbers began to skyrocket. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=861.48s)]
*  Biden was in trouble, so he gambled [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  and called for an early debate. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=865.72s)]
*  A gamble he lost. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  So badly, he lost the nomination. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=868.72s)]
*  The Democrats stripped Biden of his delegates [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=871.08s)]
*  and forced him off the stage with a gun to his head. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=873.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, guns were loaded for Trump, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=875.88s)]
*  and 45 nearly died in Butler. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=878.16s)]
*  The assassin was put down by the Biden administration. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  They stonewalled. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=883.6s)]
*  Investigators seized the shooter's phones, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=884.84s)]
*  burned his body, and still to this day, we know nothing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=887.8s)]
*  Kamala inherited Joe's war chest, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=891.76s)]
*  and the Democrats forced her onto the party [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=894.12s)]
*  and manufactured a bounce that began to fizzle this fall. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  The more she exposed herself as someone [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=899.92s)]
*  who couldn't really be taken seriously, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=902.4399999999999s)]
*  the more we saw of Kamala, the less we liked her. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=904.88s)]
*  And when she said there wasn't really anything [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  she'd do differently than Joe Biden, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=909.7199999999999s)]
*  that may have been the beginning of the end. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  But the more we saw of Trump [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  in ways which we've never seen him before, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=916.0s)]
*  McDonald's drive-through window and taking out the garbage, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=918.16s)]
*  America became comfortable again [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=921.8s)]
*  with the idea of returning the former president [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=923.88s)]
*  to the White House. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=926.08s)]
*  But the machine kept coming. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=927.48s)]
*  Oprah, Michelle, Barack, Bill, Hillary, Bruce, Beyonce. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=929.2s)]
*  60 minutes, biased moderators, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=933.88s)]
*  a list of hoaxes longer than a diner menu. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=936.08s)]
*  But the October surprise was Scranton Joe, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=939.0s)]
*  who wouldn't go down quietly. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=941.8s)]
*  His strange outbursts and oddball behavior [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=943.8399999999999s)]
*  reminded America of the mistake we'd made [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=946.4s)]
*  and the woman who'd went along for the ride. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  Democrats' frustration boiled over, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=951.8s)]
*  and the last two weeks we saw them insult [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  not just Republican voters, but their own voters. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  As the machine broke down, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=959.12s)]
*  they began calling us un-American fascist garbage [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=960.4s)]
*  who needed to be smacked in the ass. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  And Democrats who didn't agree were sexist race traders [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=965.3199999999999s)]
*  who should lie to their spouses and vote for Harris [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=968.88s)]
*  if they wanted any chance of getting lucky in bed. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=971.88s)]
*  How does this all end? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=975.24s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=976.92s)]
*  It's not over yet. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=978.08s)]
*  But this may have been the most iconic campaign [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=979.6s)]
*  in American political history. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=981.92s)]
*  The rest of the story hasn't been written. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=984.2s)]
*  That's up to you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=986.4s)]
*  If you didn't vote early, tomorrow's your day. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=988.16s)]
*  And if enough of you do what you need to do, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=991.4s)]
*  we could know the winner on election night. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=994.24s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=996.84s)]
*  All right, and welcome to Hannity in three hours, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=998.16s)]
*  less than three hours. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1001.2s)]
*  It is election night. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1002.32s)]
*  It is election day in America. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1004.0s)]
*  But breaking moments ago, as we were just discussing, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1006.08s)]
*  Joe Rogan has now officially endorsed [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1008.36s)]

*  We'll have more on this in a moment. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1011.96s)]
*  It's officially election eve, just a few hours short. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1013.6s)]
*  Polls will be open. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1016.4000000000001s)]
*  And anyone who didn't already vote, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1017.88s)]
*  well, they'll have one last day to cast their ballot. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1020.2800000000001s)]

*  It is expected. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1024.4s)]
*  80 plus million Americans will vote tomorrow. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  That means that election, this election is not decided. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1028.24s)]
*  Mark my words, it will be decided now [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  by what we call turnout. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1034.0s)]
*  Now, I've been saying to people, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1036.36s)]
*  especially if you live in Georgia, North Carolina, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  if you live in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1041.56s)]
*  if you live in Michigan, if you live in Arizona, Nevada, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1043.68s)]
*  treat your vote like it will be [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1046.8s)]
*  the deciding vote this election. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1048.36s)]
*  If you look at the polls and for what they mean, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1050.44s)]
*  whether you trust them or you don't trust them, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1053.12s)]
*  this race has razor thin margins in these key swing states. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1055.3999999999999s)]
*  Your vote will absolutely matter. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1060.0s)]
*  And you couldn't have two more distinct visions [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1062.52s)]
*  for the future of the country. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1065.4s)]
*  In these swing states alone, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1066.96s)]
*  your vote is gonna be particularly important. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1069.04s)]
*  Here's where we start tonight. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1071.24s)]
*  According to my sources, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1072.52s)]
*  there is cautious optimism at the Trump campaign. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1073.88s)]
*  Don't take that to the bank. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1076.72s)]
*  Assume your vote's the deciding vote. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1078.08s)]
*  As of tonight, Kamala Harris has a little bit [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1080.2s)]
*  of a math problem in key battleground states [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1082.4s)]
*  because early vote turnout was way down for Democrats, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1084.84s)]
*  especially in deep blue urban areas. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1089.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, early vote turnout was way up for Republicans [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1091.8s)]
*  with a record participation in rural areas. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  But all of this will mean absolutely nothing [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1097.56s)]
*  without a big day tomorrow. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1100.28s)]
*  What I would say is the sense of urgency is critical. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1102.12s)]
*  This is a tipping point. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  I would even call it an inflection point for the country. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  There is so much at stake. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you care about your children, your grandchildren, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  you gotta care about the direction of the country. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1114.1999999999998s)]
*  There's no doubt a Kamala Harris presidency, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1116.52s)]
*  my mind would be a disaster. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1119.72s)]
*  Now, despite all the vague answers, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1120.96s)]
*  I love my favorite answer is, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1123.3200000000002s)]
*  Kamala, what do you think of the economy? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1124.92s)]
*  I was born in the middle class. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1126.92s)]
*  Kamala, what do you think of the immigration problem? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1128.3200000000002s)]
*  Did you know that I grew up in a middle class neighborhood? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1132.52s)]
*  Besides all of that, the uncomfortable obnoxious, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1135.52s)]
*  giggling, the lack of vetting from the media, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1139.3200000000002s)]
*  which I think is a huge story [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1141.92s)]
*  as it relates to the entire election cycle, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1143.8400000000001s)]
*  there is no mystery about what Kamala Harris truly believes. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1146.6s)]
*  This is the single most radical far left candidate [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1150.28s)]
*  to ever run as a major party candidate. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1153.1599999999999s)]
*  But don't take my words for it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1155.8799999999999s)]
*  In spite of the media hiding all of this from you, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  before you vote, let's do what the state run media mob [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1160.36s)]
*  has purposely failed to do. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1163.8s)]
*  Let's just play Kamala, her real views in her own words [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1166.1999999999998s)]
*  that she has been unwilling to express [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1170.36s)]
*  and she'd been ducking and dodging and hiding [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1173.0s)]
*  and bobbing and weaving. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1175.4s)]
*  Let's start with the lifeblood of the world economy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1176.88s)]
*  It's called energy. Take a look. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1181.52s)]
*  your first day in office, adding the United States [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1184.92s)]
*  to the list of countries who have banned [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1188.0s)]
*  this devastating practice? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1189.8000000000002s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1191.0s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1193.52s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1194.72s)]
*  Yes. And I've, again, worked on that. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1196.3200000000002s)]
*  Of course, she wants to win Pennsylvania, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1198.52s)]
*  so she's taking a different position. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1203.0s)]
*  Which Kamala do you believe? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1206.0s)]
*  You think that person will be eager to sign off [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1207.48s)]
*  on new leases for fracking? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  She's been against offshore drilling. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  She has long wanted to destroy the fossil fuel industry [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1213.72s)]
*  in America. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1216.52s)]
*  She's the one that supported electric vehicle mandates [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  in the country, not choice mandates. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1220.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, in his first term, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump unleashed American energy. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  He became the first, we became energy independent [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1227.32s)]
*  for the first time in 75 years. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1229.64s)]
*  Remember what you were paying? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1231.92s)]
*  The price of the pump was way down. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1232.76s)]
*  You were paying a dollar, $1.50 more a gallon [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1235.0800000000002s)]
*  for gasoline now. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1237.2s)]
*  America was a net exporter of energy. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1238.64s)]
*  At the same time, Kamala co-sponsored, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1241.44s)]
*  the capital is killing $93 trillion, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1243.5200000000002s)]
*  Green New Deal proudly declared [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1246.44s)]
*  that she would eliminate the filibuster [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1248.64s)]
*  to ram it through Congress. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1250.2s)]
*  Take a look, her in her own words. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1251.48s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1254.76s)]
*  If they fail to act as President of the United States, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1256.3200000000002s)]
*  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1260.0800000000002s)]
*  to pass a Green New Deal. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1263.48s)]
*  I forgot to add. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1265.08s)]
*  Why is she not running on what she really believes? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1269.88s)]
*  She co-sponsored that bill with Bernie Sanders [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1271.96s)]
*  in the US Senate. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1273.92s)]
*  Let's be clear, that Green New Deal [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1275.0s)]
*  would implement full-fledged socialism, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1276.96s)]
*  statism, Marxism, pick the word of your choice [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1279.2s)]
*  into the US. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1281.96s)]
*  It would cost a whopping $93 trillion, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  allow the government to control the means of production [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1285.52s)]
*  in several major industries [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  and spell the end of capitalism [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  and the end of the American dream. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1294.24s)]
*  And by the way, capitalism, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  the greatest wealth creation system ever designed [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1296.4799999999998s)]
*  by mankind. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1299.0s)]
*  But Kamala thinks it's a great idea. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1300.1599999999999s)]
*  So great that she wrote the bill in the Senate. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1302.9599999999998s)]
*  Now Kamala's track record on the economy [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  is absolutely awful. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1307.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1308.6s)]
*  Fighting inflation is one of our administration's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1309.9599999999998s)]
*  top economic priorities. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1313.1999999999998s)]
*  Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1315.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, these price spikes seem like [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1319.28s)]
*  they're gonna be with us for a while. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1320.76s)]
*  We have to address the fact that [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1322.24s)]
*  we gotta deal with the fact that folks are paying for gas, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1325.32s)]
*  paying for groceries, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1328.48s)]
*  and need solutions to it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1329.92s)]
*  She's promoting policies like saying that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1333.4s)]
*  every single carbon emission in the country, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1335.24s)]
*  every car should be eliminated within the next 11 years, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1336.8s)]
*  everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1339.68s)]
*  Do you agree that she could possibly, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1342.56s)]
*  and this ideology of the socialist left [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1344.08s)]
*  could splinter your party? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1346.28s)]
*  No. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1347.88s)]
*  I think that she is challenging the status quo. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1349.0s)]
*  I think that's fantastic. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1354.0s)]
*  We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1%. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1358.68s)]
*  And that part of that is gonna be about [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1362.48s)]
*  repealing that tax bill that they just passed. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1363.92s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes are gonna have to go up. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1366.68s)]
*  By the way, now she's saying on day one, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1369.72s)]
*  she's going to deal with inflation [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1371.92s)]
*  and that she's gonna fix the border [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1374.24s)]
*  that she's been telling us for three plus years [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1375.96s)]
*  is secure. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1378.56s)]
*  Wasn't day one, January 20th, 2021, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  and talking about a 70 to 80% tax rate, okay, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1384.4399999999998s)]
*  on top of a tax on unrealized capital gains, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1387.6s)]
*  a capital gains hike in and of itself, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1390.48s)]
*  of course she is vowed to let the Trump tax cuts expire. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1392.6799999999998s)]
*  That means all of you will pay higher taxes. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1396.76s)]
*  Remember, Trump lowered taxes for all Americans [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1399.4399999999998s)]
*  with those tax cuts, but who benefited? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1402.32s)]
*  The middle class and minorities in America. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1405.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala thinks Bidenomics was a great success. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1407.64s)]
*  She wouldn't change a thing. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1410.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  All that ladies and gentlemen, and everyone else, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1413.24s)]
*  that is called Bidenomics. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1416.3200000000002s)]
*  Bidenomics. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1418.72s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1419.5600000000002s)]
*  And we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1424.48s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1427.3200000000002s)]
*  Bidenomics is working. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1430.64s)]
*  You probably forget, but under Donald Trump, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1434.5200000000002s)]
*  inflation was nonexistent. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1436.52s)]
*  Under Biden and Harris, prices have gone up [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1438.72s)]
*  more than 20 plus percent on average, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1441.32s)]
*  but Kamala just doesn't seem to notice [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1443.76s)]
*  the record setting inflation only until recently [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1446.04s)]
*  when she became the presumptive nominee. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1448.84s)]
*  This is coming from the same Kamala Harris [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1451.04s)]
*  who told us the border's secure. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1452.96s)]
*  You might not remember this. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1454.76s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1457.36s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1459.96s)]
*  with the president and I asked Congress to do [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1464.12s)]
*  is the first request we made, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1466.76s)]
*  pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1469.7199999999998s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1475.4799999999998s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1476.56s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1480.1999999999998s)]
*  for any nation, including ours and our administration. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, before Kamala, under Donald Trump, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  the border was secure, record low crossings, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1492.76s)]
*  but then came the borders are Kamala Harris [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1495.64s)]
*  and a flood of unvetted Harris-Biden illegal immigrants, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1498.76s)]
*  nearly 12 and a half million of them. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1502.36s)]
*  She knew the border wasn't secure. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1504.28s)]
*  She knew millions of these illegal immigrants [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1505.84s)]
*  were unvetted, pouring into our country each and every year. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1508.4s)]
*  That included murderers, rapists, known terrorists. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1512.32s)]
*  We don't know where they are, but they're in the country [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1515.08s)]
*  were coming in record numbers from over 180 countries, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1517.24s)]
*  including Iran, including Syria, including Afghanistan, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1520.2s)]
*  including Egypt and Venezuela, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1524.16s)]
*  and tens and tens of thousands from China and Russia. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1526.64s)]
*  Murderers, rapists, gang members, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1529.88s)]
*  other violent convicted criminals [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1531.76s)]
*  were entering our country, are here now. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1533.32s)]
*  She knew that billions of taxpayer dollars, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1535.8400000000001s)]
*  your money were being spent on food, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1538.32s)]
*  housing, healthcare, education, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1540.04s)]
*  childcare for illegal immigrants. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1542.32s)]
*  But this is what Kamala supports. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1544.72s)]
*  In fact, she chose a running mate, Tim Walz, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1546.6000000000001s)]
*  who advocated for taxpayer-funded college tuition [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1549.08s)]
*  for Harris-Biden illegals and legal driver's licenses [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1552.08s)]
*  as well, Kamala herself supporting taxpayer-funded [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1555.8799999999999s)]
*  sex change operations for convicts [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  and for her illegal immigrants. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1563.32s)]
*  It's crazy, I know. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1565.96s)]
*  Almost sounds like impossible to believe, but it's true. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1567.84s)]
*  That is who you might be voting for tomorrow. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1572.1999999999998s)]
*  Now America's border crisis is par for the course. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1574.9199999999998s)]
*  For years, Kamala advocated for open borders [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1578.0s)]
*  where illegal immigration is decriminalized, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1580.76s)]
*  so its mission accomplished for Biden's borders are. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1583.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1586.08s)]
*  You support giving universal healthcare, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1587.44s)]
*  Medicare for all to people who are in this country illegally? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1590.16s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1592.96s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1595.44s)]
*  any human being from access to public safety, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1599.84s)]
*  public education, or public health, period. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1604.84s)]
*  If someone crosses over the border, it's illegal, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  it is illegal, and you would decriminalize it. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  I would not make it a crime punishable by jail. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1612.08s)]
*  It should be a civil enforcement issue, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1615.8s)]
*  but not a criminal enforcement issue. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1617.9599999999998s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1619.7199999999998s)]
*  let's be perfectly clear. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1621.76s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1624.84s)]
*  is not going to stop them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1627.8s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1629.4399999999998s)]
*  that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1630.8s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1634.52s)]
*  and the work it is doing, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1636.28s)]
*  and we need to probably think about starting from scratch. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1637.28s)]
*  That is the real Kamala Harris. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1641.2s)]
*  That is the Kamala Harris that has protected [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1643.04s)]
*  her entire campaign by the state-run media mob. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1645.96s)]
*  Not only does she want to decriminalize [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1649.48s)]
*  the illegal immigration, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1651.32s)]
*  she also seems to have a very soft spot in her heart [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1652.32s)]
*  for violent criminals and rioters. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1655.6399999999999s)]
*  You might recall the media didn't remind you [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1657.6399999999999s)]
*  during this election year. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1659.96s)]
*  The summer of 2020, 574 riots, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1661.36s)]
*  four days after a police precinct [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1664.6s)]
*  was burned to the ground in Minneapolis, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1666.6399999999999s)]
*  she promoted a Minnesota bail fund, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1668.52s)]
*  raising money to get violent offenders back on the streets. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1670.72s)]
*  And again, four days after a police precinct [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1674.08s)]
*  burned to the ground. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1676.72s)]
*  And then she went on CBS, Colbert, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1677.76s)]
*  and said, those rioters, they're not gonna stop, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1680.28s)]
*  and they shouldn't stop. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1683.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm not gonna stop supporting them, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1684.9199999999998s)]
*  in case you forgot. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1686.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a movement, I'm telling you. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1688.84s)]
*  They're not gonna stop. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1690.96s)]
*  And everyone beware, because they're not gonna stop, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1692.52s)]
*  they're not gonna stop before election day in November, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1696.44s)]
*  and they're not gonna stop after election day. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1698.8s)]
*  And that should be, everyone should take note of that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1701.1200000000001s)]
*  on both levels, that they're not gonna let up, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1703.72s)]
*  and they should not. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1706.64s)]
*  Ms. Liz Cheney watching, beware, take note, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1709.2s)]
*  they're not gonna stop and shouldn't stop. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1712.24s)]
*  So Kamala seemingly wants to decriminalize [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1714.32s)]
*  left-wing violent riots, illegal immigration, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1716.56s)]
*  but if you are a law-abiding American, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1719.28s)]
*  don't you dare utter the words, the illegal alien, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1721.88s)]
*  or radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1724.0800000000002s)]
*  You need to be courageous, according to Kamala. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1725.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1728.2800000000002s)]
*  You must have the courage to object [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1730.24s)]
*  when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1733.5600000000002s)]
*  which ignores how Muslims have over-dominated [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1738.92s)]

*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1757.28s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1760.84s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1763.48s)]
*  In contrast, no one values freedom of speech [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1768.84s)]
*  more than Donald Trump. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1771.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris doesn't just want [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1772.28s)]
*  a censor your speech, she wants to ban a lot of things, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1774.44s)]
*  like private health insurance. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1777.12s)]
*  She said it in her own words. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1778.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1780.1999999999998s)]
*  You support the Medicare for All bill, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1781.04s)]

*  So for people out there who like their insurance, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1790.9599999999998s)]
*  they don't get to keep it? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1793.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1795.32s)]

*  well, I don't know if your insurance company [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1811.6399999999999s)]
*  is gonna cover this. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1813.6s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1814.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1816.24s)]
*  Government-run healthcare, even for illegal immigrants, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1818.8s)]
*  and no private health insurance. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1821.8799999999999s)]
*  She also wants to get rid of the Second Amendment [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1823.28s)]

*  her mandatory gun buyback program. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1830.52s)]

*  I'd call that gun confiscation. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1834.72s)]
*  You decide. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1836.2s)]
*  So weapons that are already in circulation, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1837.72s)]
*  what do you do about those? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1840.2s)]
*  Well, there are approximately five million [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1841.2s)]

*  We have to have a buyback program [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1843.96s)]
*  and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1845.44s)]
*  How mandatory is your gun buyback program? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1850.2s)]
*  Second Amendment? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1851.92s)]
*  The Second Amendment, listen, we have to, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1853.16s)]
*  we're gonna have to do it the right way. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1855.4s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1856.72s)]
*  But we don't have, we have to get these guns off the street. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1858.24s)]
*  Just because you legally possess a gun [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1862.6s)]

*  doesn't mean that we're not gonna walk into that home [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1867.8s)]
*  and check to see if you're being responsible and safe [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  in the way you conduct your affair. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1872.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, he will protect your First Amendment rights, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1874.9599999999998s)]

*  That is your choice tomorrow. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1879.9599999999998s)]
*  While Kamala will be coming for your guns [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1881.6799999999998s)]
*  based on Kamala's own words, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1883.56s)]
*  she wants to turn America into Venezuela. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1885.0s)]
*  But with less oil and gas production, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1887.7199999999998s)]
*  that is the worst case scenario. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  It will lead to massive shortages. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1891.52s)]
*  It will increase the cost of everything you buy [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1893.48s)]
*  in every store you go to, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1895.6399999999999s)]
*  even way beyond the current inflation we are experiencing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1896.72s)]
*  That would be economic ruin, a loss of freedom. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1900.32s)]
*  And frankly, America will become unrecognizable, in my view. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1903.44s)]
*  Not a great scenario. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1908.12s)]
*  The best case scenario is that she is a continuation [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1909.92s)]
*  of the Biden White House, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1912.48s)]

*  in modern American history. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1916.36s)]
*  The inflation will continue. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1918.36s)]
*  Prices will not come down. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1919.76s)]
*  Government spending will only go up. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1921.32s)]
*  Taxes will go up. Regulations will go up. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1922.96s)]
*  Crime will rise. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1925.36s)]
*  Chaos will continue around the globe. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1926.36s)]

*  she played a vital role [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=1930.8s)]

*  The world was a more peaceful place. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump did his first term, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2098.04s)]
*  and this is what he plans to do to make America great again. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2100.6800000000003s)]
*  So you can turn off the noise and the smears — [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2103.84s)]
*  being called a Nazi, being called a racist, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2106.88s)]
*  being called a fascist, being called garbage — [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2109.2400000000002s)]
*  and there's only one option. I'm only one host. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2112.4s)]
*  I have this camera, which you give me every night. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2116.08s)]
*  I'm very grateful for it. But this choice is yours. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2118.96s)]
*  Yes, thank you, thank you. You pull my lever. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2133.76s)]
*  Happy Monday, everyone. So I voted earlier today, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2137.76s)]
*  and this is a sticker that poll workers gave me. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2140.76s)]
*  Very cute. Here in NYC, this is the sticker [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2143.6s)]
*  they're giving the Venezuelan gang members. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2147.2s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2149.7599999999998s)]
*  And down in Washington, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2153.08s)]
*  they made a special sticker for President Biden. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2154.2799999999997s)]
*  If you can see that, I voted today, and I'm dead. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2156.9199999999996s)]
*  And it's nice to see that Doug Emhoff [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2162.3199999999997s)]
*  is supporting his wife, Kamala, with this voting sticker. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2163.9199999999996s)]
*  I voted after nailing the nanny. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2167.8799999999997s)]
*  How could you applaud that? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2173.56s)]
*  But true, tomorrow is Election Day. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2178.92s)]
*  It's the day I play my favorite game [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2180.52s)]
*  called Looking for a Poll Worker under the Age of 90. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2182.4s)]
*  But things look so good for Trump, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2187.7599999999998s)]
*  Democrats have already impeached him. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2189.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, our current president plans on voting, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2192.7999999999997s)]
*  but only after he finishes his breakfast. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  Speaking of Doug Emhoff, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2197.84s)]
*  he campaigned for his wife this weekend, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2199.32s)]
*  saying Kamala did what she always does. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2201.8s)]
*  Quote, she put her head down and went to work. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2204.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what we need in the Oval Office, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2213.92s)]
*  said one man. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2217.56s)]
*  A little misdirection. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  The New York City Marathon took place yesterday. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  No surprise, of the more than 50,000 runners, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2224.32s)]
*  half are still missing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2226.84s)]
*  Coldplay's Chris Martin fell through a trap door [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2230.84s)]
*  during a performance in Melbourne. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2235.32s)]
*  More bad news, he's fine. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2238.12s)]
*  And he's not going to be in the Oval Office [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2240.12s)]
*  until the end of the year. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2242.6s)]
*  But he's going to be in the Oval Office [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2244.6s)]
*  More bad news, he's fine. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2247.28s)]
*  Later this month, the McRib will return [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2251.7200000000003s)]
*  to select McDonald's restaurants. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2253.8s)]
*  And that's the power of prayer, said one man. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2256.1600000000003s)]
*  And a new handheld device may soon cure insomnia [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2263.4s)]
*  by turning off your mind. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2267.2000000000003s)]
*  I think we have a picture of it here. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2268.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2273.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2274.76s)]
*  Mop for two days, rip him. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2275.88s)]
*  So one of the key differences between the left and right [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2277.88s)]
*  is one side's willingness to leave you alone. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2280.88s)]
*  Sure, all politicians want power, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2283.84s)]
*  but clearly one kind is more invasive than the other. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2285.5600000000004s)]
*  So meet public enemy number one, Peanut the Squirrel. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  Apparently the most sinister rodent since Adam Schiff. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  Or he was, until the state of New York decided he had to go. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2299.96s)]
*  His crimes seem to have been something [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2304.04s)]
*  to do with living indoors, unlike half of New York City. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2306.2400000000002s)]
*  I guess if he had a tent and smoked meth, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2310.64s)]
*  he'd still be with us. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2312.48s)]
*  But last week, agents from the New York State [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2314.64s)]
*  Department of Environmental Conservation [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2316.8s)]
*  unleashed a five-hour raid on the home of Peanut's owner, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2319.16s)]
*  Mark Longo, and took Peanut into custody. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2322.96s)]
*  Five hours. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2327.04s)]
*  Probably took that long to put on the little handcuffs. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2328.36s)]
*  But thanks to a full 10 agents prepared for heavy resistance, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2332.8s)]
*  Peanut was apprehended with minimal injury. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2336.36s)]
*  They must have spent the full five hours padding down his nuts. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2340.1200000000003s)]
*  But for these brave agents of New York's environmental [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2344.6800000000003s)]
*  conservation, this was their bin Laden. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2347.4s)]
*  Clearly Peanut had to go, a rodent Nazi, a nutsy, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2350.92s)]
*  if you will, because in New York, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2355.4s)]
*  they don't want squirrels taking your nuts, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2357.8s)]
*  just the pediatricians. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2360.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2362.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2363.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2364.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, Peanut had a co-conspirator, Fred the Raccoon. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2366.0s)]
*  Obviously a criminal, because he was always wearing that mask. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2369.6800000000003s)]
*  Fred was also removed in the raid and, like Peanut, executed. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2373.6800000000003s)]
*  No trial, no jury, no due process, nothing. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2378.88s)]
*  It's as if they were at the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2381.76s)]
*  Maybe they were the ones who crapped on Pelosi's desk. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2384.8s)]
*  Now, the state claims they had to euthanize both animals [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2387.52s)]
*  so that they could be tested for rabies [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2391.2s)]
*  after Peanut bit one of the officials. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2393.32s)]
*  Yes, a bite that occurred during the raid, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2396.24s)]
*  meaning the state claims they solved the problem [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2398.44s)]
*  that they themselves caused. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2400.52s)]
*  They raided a house, antagonized a terrified squirrel, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2402.48s)]
*  and when it bit them, put it down. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2405.88s)]
*  Case closed. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2407.88s)]
*  The city is now safe from one adorable rodent. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2408.88s)]
*  As for the owner, he and his wife [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2412.92s)]
*  As for the owner, he and his wife think someone ratted them out. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2415.64s)]
*  Turns out they have an OnlyFans page where they post porn, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2419.56s)]
*  and that page helped them rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2423.24s)]
*  which they used to buy their 350-acre property. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2426.24s)]
*  Now, as a New York state resident, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2430.52s)]
*  I can't tell you how much I appreciate [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2432.3599999999997s)]
*  the state's commitment to my safety. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2435.2s)]
*  You know, I was starting to think that with all this crime [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2437.8799999999997s)]
*  and homelessness and migrant chaos, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2439.8799999999997s)]
*  things were going in the wrong direction, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2441.96s)]
*  but now, thank God, we're back to law and order, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2443.72s)]
*  first with the squirrels. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2447.08s)]
*  Now, the joke about priorities is obvious, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2450.8399999999997s)]
*  but the process itself isn't. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2453.4399999999996s)]
*  Big government, by its nature, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2455.72s)]
*  only sees itself as growing bigger, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2457.24s)]
*  and as it grows, so does its intrusiveness. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2459.56s)]
*  But as they wish to control every aspect of your life, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2462.52s)]
*  they forego the basics they were initially designed to cover. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  Crime, sanitation, homelessness, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2470.44s)]
*  only instead to focus on stupid... [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2473.96s)]
*  like your pets, your lemonade stands, your pronouns. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2476.8s)]
*  And why? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2480.36s)]
*  Well, what is government made of? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2481.8s)]
*  Bureaucrats, the robots who feather their nest [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2484.1200000000003s)]
*  by doing exactly what they're told. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2487.32s)]
*  Think about it, did anyone during this raid [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2489.88s)]
*  just stop at any point and say, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2491.7200000000003s)]
*  hey, wait a minute, this is... stupid? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2493.52s)]
*  This is crazy! This is nuts! [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2496.32s)]
*  Or was the whole thing just on automatic, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2501.28s)]
*  as the old saying goes, just following orders? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2503.96s)]
*  You know, we worry about the non-conscious thinking [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2507.32s)]
*  of artificial intelligence. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2510.2000000000003s)]
*  Once it starts, you can't stop it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2512.2000000000003s)]
*  But meter maids, civil servants, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2514.56s)]
*  and state environmental control officers are already there, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2516.96s)]
*  and they're worse. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2521.0s)]
*  They're just following the Democrat policy [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2522.44s)]
*  with the power of judge, jury, and executioner. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2525.04s)]
*  Fact is, most people are not political [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  until politics enters their lives. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2530.12s)]
*  You could be completely disinterested in the whole thing, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2532.64s)]
*  and then the government shows up to tell you [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2535.96s)]
*  that your kid's gender is fungible [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2537.68s)]
*  and your pets are expendable. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2539.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like parents who never gave a... about anything more [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2541.92s)]
*  than homework and soccer practice until COVID showed up. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2545.16s)]
*  And then they attended a school board meeting [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2549.04s)]
*  and realized the maniacs are in charge. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2551.24s)]
*  Maybe we ought to thank China for inventing a virus [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2554.52s)]
*  that acted more like smelling salts for us, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2557.08s)]
*  and woke the average citizen the f*** up. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2559.68s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying peanuts' death just flipped New York, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2563.6s)]
*  but you want to red pill America, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2567.2s)]

*  probably in this studio, you own more pets? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2618.96s)]
*  No, I don't, Greg, that's not true. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2622.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2624.48s)]

*  Okay. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2627.28s)]

*  Get around and find out. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2630.76s)]
*  This bothered me on a personal level, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2636.0s)]
*  I don't understand, their excuse was that peanut bit them. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2638.6s)]
*  What did Fred do, giggle? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2643.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2644.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, this is what these officials do. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2645.28s)]
*  Now I had a similar thing happen to me [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2647.92s)]
*  where a person tried to break into my house [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2650.12s)]
*  in the backyard and I had cane corsels at the time. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2652.48s)]
*  And my dog bit him on the ass for trying to [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2655.28s)]
*  get in my back window. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2658.6800000000003s)]
*  Now when he was discovered, my dog was hanging from his ass [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2660.2000000000003s)]
*  because he was a good boy. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2663.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2664.8s)]
*  He didn't finish him, he held him. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2665.64s)]
*  They came in and took my dogs, I cooperated with them [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  and I said, please keep them two together, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2670.7999999999997s)]
*  they've never been apart, they're like, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2672.92s)]
*  no problem, no problem. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2674.0s)]
*  I had to go to court to get my dogs [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2675.16s)]
*  and the judge said they were just protecting their home, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2677.24s)]
*  you can pick your dogs up. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2679.16s)]
*  When I went to pick them up, they euthanized them. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2680.3599999999997s)]
*  Because they tried to separate them [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2683.92s)]
*  and the big one got aggressive. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2685.2s)]
*  So this is not, unfortunately, this is not uncommon. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2687.56s)]
*  The people that come in are power hungry, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2691.16s)]
*  you raided their house looking for what? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2693.76s)]
*  The story about rabies, a squirrel with rabies [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2698.0s)]
*  is not hard to figure out. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2701.0400000000004s)]
*  They got a little frothy mouth, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2703.48s)]
*  well they look a lot like Hunter Biden [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2704.84s)]
*  when you crack. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2706.1600000000003s)]
*  They're aggressive and no owner would be holding them. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2708.32s)]
*  Right. They don't do tricks. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2711.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's a terrible thing and you know what, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2713.0800000000004s)]
*  it did wake a lot of people up. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2715.8s)]
*  And crazy, it could flip. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2717.88s)]
*  So if you're on the ropes, if you're not sure, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2720.72s)]
*  and you wanna get on the right team, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2724.8799999999997s)]
*  if you don't wanna vote because Tyrus told you to, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2726.4399999999996s)]
*  which you shouldn't anyways, or a celebrity, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2728.8799999999997s)]
*  do it for Peanut and Fred. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2731.48s)]
*  Do it for Peanut and Fred! [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2733.72s)]
*  Do it for Peanut and Fred! [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2736.04s)]
*  Their names will not go silently into the night. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2742.7999999999997s)]
*  Guy, this is a great moment. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2745.3199999999997s)]
*  Where a lot of people who weren't thinking about government [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  now realize how evil government can be. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2753.56s)]
*  Yeah, so two things. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2756.2799999999997s)]
*  Number one, I was unaware until yesterday [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  of this OnlyFans angle from the squirrel's dad. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2760.16s)]
*  So I'm a journalist, Greg, so I did look into it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2765.2799999999997s)]
*  And I can confirm that that is a thing. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2768.3199999999997s)]
*  So I just wanted to make sure there was a fact check there. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2770.9599999999996s)]
*  Secondly, with all respect to our resident libertarian, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2774.16s)]
*  libertarians are often very annoying. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2778.08s)]
*  However, they are often right about a lot of things. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2780.96s)]
*  And I feel like the libertarian movement [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  should almost nominate a dead squirrel [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2785.2799999999997s)]
*  as their next presidential nominee, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2790.36s)]
*  just to draw attention to what happened to Peanut, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2792.3199999999997s)]
*  because it is the most cartoonish, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2795.64s)]
*  disgusting abuse of government [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2798.72s)]
*  that shows all the wrong priorities, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2801.64s)]
*  and it's so easy for people to understand. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2803.72s)]
*  And if you're not gonna mess with anything in the country, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2806.4s)]
*  or if you're gonna mess with anything in the country, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2809.56s)]
*  it ought not be pets and animals. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2811.04s)]
*  People will lose their mind over that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think this is a horrible story, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2815.2400000000002s)]
*  but will focus people's minds. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Piers, you have squirrels in England. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2819.2000000000003s)]
*  We do. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2822.32s)]
*  They're black squirrels, aren't they? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2823.1600000000003s)]
*  We also used to have red squirrels [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2824.44s)]
*  before they all got eradicated, yeah. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2825.88s)]
*  Something about this story is just utterly disgusting, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2828.96s)]
*  isn't it? Yeah, yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like I was reading about it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2833.28s)]
*  I'm thinking 10 to 10 people get sent by the government [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2834.56s)]
*  at a time when, as you say, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2838.0s)]
*  New York is riddled with crime, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  and homelessness, and mayhem. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2841.4s)]
*  And 10 of them can spend five hours of their day [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  coming after a squirrel and a raccoon. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2847.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2850.48s)]
*  And the rabies line, only one set of people, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2851.32s)]
*  seems to me, were behaving like [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2854.72s)]
*  foaming-at-the-mouth, rabid animals. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2856.84s)]
*  And it wasn't the raccoon and the squirrel. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2859.64s)]
*  It was the people that had been sent by the government, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2862.64s)]
*  foaming, furious, vengeful, murderous, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2865.36s)]
*  to eradicate the scourge of this famous little squirrel [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2869.52s)]
*  and his raccoon mate. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2873.12s)]
*  If you were making this up, it would be funny, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2875.52s)]
*  but it's true. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2878.64s)]
*  And this couple have lost their beloved pets. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2880.08s)]
*  Remember why they took on this squirrel? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2882.64s)]
*  Because I had to, I didn't know the story, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2886.2s)]
*  and I looked into it. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2887.64s)]
*  So the squirrel's mother died, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2888.7999999999997s)]
*  and this guy saw this happen, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2891.44s)]
*  and he took the little baby squirrel in, right? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2893.52s)]
*  He took in the little baby squirrel. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2896.76s)]
*  And then he has to have it wrenched away [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2899.08s)]
*  by his own government and murdered. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2901.1600000000003s)]
*  It is disgusting. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2904.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow, Kat, this is becoming an incredibly powerful segment. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2907.08s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even think about peanut [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2912.1600000000003s)]
*  because it makes me too upset. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2913.76s)]
*  Yeah, do you know that some people, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2914.84s)]
*  like I have friends that could not talk about this. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2916.04s)]
*  It's a real, no, I get it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2917.88s)]
*  I have a feral animal that lives in my house. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2919.04s)]
*  It just happens to be a cat, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2920.76s)]
*  but it's found on the street, same thing. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2922.36s)]
*  But I really did like your larger point about how [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2924.5600000000004s)]
*  it's just people who just like, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2926.88s)]
*  oh, the putz, the policy. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2927.96s)]
*  We gotta follow the rules with the policy. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2930.5200000000004s)]
*  It's not, this happens in government every single day. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2932.84s)]
*  This is what government does, this is what it is. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2935.6000000000004s)]
*  And libertarians are right a lot of the time for that reason. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2938.2000000000003s)]
*  Happened to me this weekend at the airport. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2941.0400000000004s)]
*  I was groped like ridiculously by the TSA [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2943.0s)]
*  because I'm on crutches, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2946.4s)]
*  and so I'm on a wheelchair through the airport, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2948.32s)]
*  and I couldn't, it's got metal, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2950.0s)]
*  so I couldn't go through, so they had to grop me. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2951.68s)]
*  And they're rubbing my stomach for like 30 seconds. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2953.2s)]
*  I'm like, it's a baby, right? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2956.32s)]
*  And then they are rubbing each of my legs, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2958.4s)]
*  they're rubbing my butt like repeatedly, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2961.32s)]
*  and I'm like, there's no, I said, you and I both know [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2963.6s)]
*  I'm not gonna do a terrorism here, I did say that. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2965.96s)]
*  So then they brought the manager over. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2968.48s)]
*  So then, but I looked at the manager, I said, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2970.28s)]
*  you, he was like, you're keeping everybody safe. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2973.64s)]
*  I'm like, you don't even believe that. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2975.4s)]
*  But they kept saying to me, it's the policy. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2976.84s)]
*  It's the policy. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2978.64s)]
*  It's the policy that we need to touch your crotch [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2979.48s)]
*  as a pregnant woman with a broken hip. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2981.92s)]
*  Like, it's the policy that we have to kill your pet [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2983.76s)]
*  that's loved you for seven years. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2987.12s)]
*  It's the policy. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2989.04s)]
*  You shouldn't have been living inside. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2990.28s)]
*  That's the biggest problem, that he was living inside. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2991.8s)]
*  I mean, I just, it's, but the policy, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2995.72s)]
*  these people don't think, and I don't like when, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=2998.2s)]
*  it's never been a good enough excuse for me, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3000.88s)]
*  but that's the rules. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3002.52s)]
*  Maybe your rules are stupid. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3003.36s)]
*  Maybe your rules inhumane. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3005.04s)]
*  Maybe your rules hurting people. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3006.28s)]
*  What do you have to say to that now? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3007.6s)]
*  And they never have anything to say. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3008.84s)]
*  They don't, but that's a, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3009.88s)]
*  this is a thing that comes up in society. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3011.32s)]
*  It's like, I'm just doing, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3013.56s)]
*  you find that when even in customer service, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3015.04s)]
*  there are people that cannot go, like just look, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3017.6400000000003s)]
*  they just have to follow the path no matter how. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3020.08s)]
*  Nobody sees this. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3022.1200000000003s)]
*  It's also the big, sorry, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3022.96s)]
*  it's also the big powerful ego. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3024.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3026.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, because if I was standing in their backyard [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3027.44s)]
*  ripping their tree out, and the tenant would be like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3029.6800000000003s)]
*  yeah, that's the feral animal right there, go get him. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3031.84s)]
*  They're like, well, we're gonna have to call another guy [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3033.76s)]
*  for this, we're gonna have to get another thing for that. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3035.1600000000003s)]
*  But a little tiny squirrel, he bit me. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3036.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm putting him down. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3039.44s)]
*  They're so powerful. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3040.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like, the other thing is, Kat, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3041.12s)]
*  by telling us that story, you probably just increased [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3043.8399999999997s)]
*  TSA jobs by at least 100,000. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3046.48s)]
*  Nobody's looking at a pregnant woman [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3048.7999999999997s)]
*  leaning over on one crutch while a lady rubs her ass [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3050.96s)]
*  and a man is watching and says, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3054.12s)]
*  oh, this is necessary, this is okay. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3055.4s)]
*  I feel safe. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kww_KO5Eh8&t=3057.48s)]
