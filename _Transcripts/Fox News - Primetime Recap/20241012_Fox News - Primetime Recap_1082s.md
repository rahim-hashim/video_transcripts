# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 11, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=2.0s)]
*  As always, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=4.0s)]
*  Obama's got nothing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=6.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=8.0s)]
*  All right, his swagger doesn't have the appeal [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=12.0s)]
*  it used to have. His shout-outs, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=14.0s)]
*  hello, Pittsburgh! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=16.0s)]
*  The audience, it just kind of seems juvenile, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=18.0s)]
*  I think. And now the man [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=20.0s)]
*  who won the presidency as the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=22.0s)]
*  great uniter is making [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=24.0s)]
*  a nakedly racial [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=26.0s)]
*  insulting appeal to black [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=28.0s)]
*  male voters who are skeptical of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=30.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=32.0s)]
*  We have not yet seen [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=34.0s)]
*  the same kinds of energy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=36.0s)]
*  and turnout [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=38.0s)]
*  as we saw when I [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=40.0s)]
*  was running. That seems [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=42.0s)]
*  to be more pronounced [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=44.0s)]
*  with the bros. You're coming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=46.0s)]
*  up with all kinds of reasons and excuses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=48.0s)]
*  I've got a problem with that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=50.0s)]
*  Part of it makes me think [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=52.0s)]
*  that, well, you just aren't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=54.0s)]
*  feeling the idea of having a woman [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=56.0s)]
*  as president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=58.0s)]
*  And you're coming up with other alternatives [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=60.0s)]
*  and other reasons for that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=62.0s)]
*  Well, with Kamala's mounting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=64.0s)]
*  challenges in battleground states, Obama [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=66.0s)]
*  jetted in and he held court. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=68.0s)]
*  You saw him there. But rather than [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=70.0s)]
*  addressing concerns about Harris's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=72.0s)]
*  record on the economy and on the border, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=74.0s)]
*  people's standards of living, he [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=76.0s)]
*  tried to shame black men [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=78.0s)]
*  into supporting her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=80.0s)]
*  So now, you're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=82.0s)]
*  thinking about sitting out or even [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=84.0s)]
*  supporting somebody [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=86.0s)]
*  who [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=90.0s)]
*  has a history [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=92.0s)]
*  of denigrating you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=94.0s)]
*  because you think that's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=96.0s)]
*  a sign of strength because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=98.0s)]
*  that's what being a man is. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=102.0s)]
*  Really? That's the argument? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=106.0s)]
*  His message to black men [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=108.0s)]
*  is clear. You're stupid [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=110.0s)]
*  sexist if you don't vote for Kamala. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=112.0s)]
*  Is this what all that hope and change was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=116.0s)]
*  all about all those years ago? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=118.0s)]
*  All right, let's be very clear here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=120.0s)]
*  In the history books, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=122.0s)]
*  Obama's administration will go down [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=124.0s)]
*  as a failure because when it was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=126.0s)]
*  over in 2016, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=128.0s)]
*  the voters rejected his chosen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=130.0s)]
*  candidate, Hillary Clinton, and they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=132.0s)]
*  elected someone who had never [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=134.0s)]
*  run for political office before. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=136.0s)]
*  A businessman, Donald [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=138.0s)]
*  Trump. Americans [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=140.0s)]
*  had had enough of the Obamas and they wanted [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=142.0s)]
*  to go in a completely different direction. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=144.0s)]
*  And the facts show why. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=146.0s)]
*  Remember, President Obama [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=148.0s)]
*  promised to help the middle class and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=150.0s)]
*  urban voters, but he really [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=152.0s)]
*  never did. And he promised that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=154.0s)]
*  he would get tough on China and he [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=156.0s)]
*  was going to declare them a currency manipulator. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=158.0s)]
*  But he never did. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=160.0s)]
*  And he promised to renegotiate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=162.0s)]
*  NAFTA, but we know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=164.0s)]
*  he never did that either. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=166.0s)]
*  President Trump got more done [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=168.0s)]
*  in his own one term than Obama [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=170.0s)]
*  did in two. And Trump had a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=172.0s)]
*  pandemic to deal with. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=174.0s)]
*  Now look at the real median household income [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=176.0s)]
*  numbers. Wow. Hit [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=178.0s)]
*  a record high under Trump. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=180.0s)]
*  Even CNN had to report it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, Obama knows all this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=184.0s)]
*  and he knows that in every poll conducted [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=186.0s)]
*  for the past few years, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=188.0s)]
*  voters have been very clear. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=190.0s)]
*  They prefer Trump's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=192.0s)]
*  economic record to Biden [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=194.0s)]
*  and Harris'. So [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=196.0s)]
*  while Obama I think believed he needed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=198.0s)]
*  something new to say yesterday [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=200.0s)]
*  and he tried to save this issue [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=202.0s)]
*  for Kamala. Now [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=204.0s)]
*  he's had months to think about an argument [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=206.0s)]
*  but this was the best he could come up with. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=208.0s)]
*  The reason some people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=210.0s)]
*  think, wow, I don't know, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=212.0s)]
*  I remember that economy when he first came in being [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=214.0s)]
*  pretty good. Yeah, it was pretty good [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=216.0s)]
*  because it was my economy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=218.0s)]
*  I spent eight years [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=220.0s)]
*  cleaning up the mess that the Republicans [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=222.0s)]
*  left me the last time. So just in case [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=224.0s)]
*  everybody has a hazy memory, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=226.0s)]
*  he didn't do nothing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=232.0s)]
*  except those [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=234.0s)]
*  big tax cuts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=236.0s)]
*  Not surprising [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=238.0s)]
*  from the man who famously [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=240.0s)]
*  said this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=242.0s)]
*  Somebody helped to create [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=244.0s)]
*  this unbelievable American [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=246.0s)]
*  system that we have that allowed you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=248.0s)]
*  to thrive. Somebody invested [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=250.0s)]
*  in roads and bridges. If you got a business [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=252.0s)]
*  that you didn't build that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=254.0s)]
*  Somebody else made that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=256.0s)]
*  happen. Trump didn't [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=258.0s)]
*  help build that economy. I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=260.0s)]
*  did. Now almost [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=262.0s)]
*  nothing Obama said [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=264.0s)]
*  in Pittsburgh was actually true. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=266.0s)]
*  For Donald [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=268.0s)]
*  Trump and his cronies, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=270.0s)]
*  freedom means that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=272.0s)]
*  the powerful can [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=274.0s)]
*  do whatever they please. We believe [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=276.0s)]
*  in the freedom to provide [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=278.0s)]
*  for our families. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=280.0s)]
*  We believe that true freedom gives [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=282.0s)]
*  each of us the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=284.0s)]
*  right to make decisions about our own [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=286.0s)]
*  life. Oh really? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=288.0s)]
*  Then why is Kamala [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=290.0s)]
*  sitting on a billion dollar war [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=292.0s)]
*  chest if she's not supported by the powerful? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=294.0s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=296.0s)]
*  Now under Trump, the powerful [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=298.0s)]
*  weren't allowed to flood [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=300.0s)]
*  our communities with migrants or to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=302.0s)]
*  send your jobs offshore. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=304.0s)]
*  Obama doesn't even sound like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=306.0s)]
*  he believes much of what he's saying anymore [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=308.0s)]
*  and especially about Kamala. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=310.0s)]
*  The good news is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=312.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=314.0s)]
*  she doesn't have concepts [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=316.0s)]
*  for a plan. She has [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=318.0s)]
*  an actual plan to make [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=320.0s)]
*  your life better. To bring down the cost [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=322.0s)]
*  of things like groceries. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=324.0s)]
*  She'll go after corporations that are jacking up [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=326.0s)]
*  prices. Alright, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=328.0s)]
*  I have a question for Obama. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=330.0s)]
*  If she has this great detailed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=332.0s)]
*  plan, why is she unable to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=334.0s)]
*  explain it to a defendant and a real questioning? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=336.0s)]
*  Why are the voters not buying it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=338.0s)]
*  and why does she need you to try to do it all [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=340.0s)]
*  for her? It's all ridiculous. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=342.0s)]
*  And you know what else is ridiculous? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=344.0s)]
*  That the guy who was awarded [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=346.0s)]
*  the Nobel Peace Prize in his [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=348.0s)]
*  first year in office, which is still hilarious, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=350.0s)]
*  is now on the same side as Dick [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=352.0s)]
*  Cheney. And the fact [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=354.0s)]
*  is Obama's act was always phony. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=356.0s)]
*  He was never a racial healer. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=358.0s)]
*  He was a cynical fomenter of racial [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=360.0s)]
*  divisions. And he was never [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=362.0s)]
*  a champion of the working class. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=364.0s)]
*  He supports and agrees [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=366.0s)]
*  with the same globalists and billionaires [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=368.0s)]
*  who support Kamala Harris today. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=370.0s)]
*  And he was never really a peacemaker. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=372.0s)]
*  He agrees with most of the Cheney's views [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=374.0s)]
*  on foreign policy now and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=376.0s)]
*  supports the Cheney's pick presidential [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=378.0s)]
*  candidate. Now, this is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=380.0s)]
*  his real record. And this is why the voters [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=382.0s)]
*  rejected his recommendation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=384.0s)]
*  in 2016, Hillary Clinton, and this is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=386.0s)]
*  why voters are rejecting his advice right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=388.0s)]
*  He's always been [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=390.0s)]
*  kind of the same editor of the Harvard [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=392.0s)]
*  Law Review who learned [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=394.0s)]
*  to protect and defend the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=396.0s)]
*  elites. He's comfortable with them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=398.0s)]
*  If you want to know about real [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=400.0s)]
*  estate and Martha's Vineyard or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=402.0s)]
*  hear about how to score floor [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=404.0s)]
*  tickets to the Knicks game, then he's your man. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=406.0s)]
*  But if you're trying to figure out [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=408.0s)]
*  how to build a colorblind [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=410.0s)]
*  political coalition or raise [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=412.0s)]
*  living standards for the middle class, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=414.0s)]
*  then he's the last person [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=416.0s)]
*  you should be taking advice from. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=418.0s)]
*  As we told you last night, the problem [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=420.0s)]
*  for these people isn't their calm [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=422.0s)]
*  strategy. The problem [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=424.0s)]
*  is all of them are [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=426.0s)]
*  wedded to the same failed policies [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=428.0s)]
*  that have eviscerated our [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=430.0s)]
*  middle class. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=432.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump has spent nine years [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=434.0s)]
*  under relentless assault showing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=436.0s)]
*  us that he is committed to the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=438.0s)]
*  multiracial, multiethnic, multi-state [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=440.0s)]
*  coalition to improve life [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=442.0s)]
*  for all Americans. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=444.0s)]
*  So voters, vote for your own [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=446.0s)]
*  interests. You don't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=448.0s)]
*  owe Obama anything. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=450.0s)]
*  He's going to be fine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=452.0s)]
*  He has his mansions and his movie [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=454.0s)]
*  and Netflix deals and his standing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=456.0s)]
*  invites on private yachts in the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=458.0s)]
*  south of France. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=460.0s)]
*  Now, remember, he's the smartest guy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=462.0s)]
*  they've got. And he's obviously been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=464.0s)]
*  thinking about how to defend the Biden-Harris [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=466.0s)]
*  record for months. And [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=468.0s)]
*  in the end, all he's got [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=470.0s)]
*  is you're being mean [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=472.0s)]
*  to her because you don't like women. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=474.0s)]
*  In other words, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=476.0s)]
*  they got nothing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=478.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. Kamala Harris has [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=480.0s)]
*  a man problem. White dudes for [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=482.0s)]
*  Harris isn't working and the hombres [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=484.0s)]
*  don't trust her. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=486.0s)]
*  Right now leaning towards Trump, but I haven't made a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=488.0s)]
*  decision. I'm also concerned [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=490.0s)]
*  about the way I feel [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=492.0s)]
*  President Biden was pushed aside. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=494.0s)]
*  And as [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=496.0s)]
*  Obama said, Harris [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=498.0s)]
*  also has a problem with the brothers. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=500.0s)]
*  Well, now Joe Biden's out [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=502.0s)]
*  and Kamala's in. What do you think of her? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=504.0s)]
*  Garbage. She's for herself. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=506.0s)]
*  I don't know what she did when she was the Vice President. I don't know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=508.0s)]
*  what she's gonna do now. She's part of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=510.0s)]
*  the problem of the country. A lot of people [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=512.0s)]
*  vote because she's black. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=514.0s)]
*  You don't vote for nobody because [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=516.0s)]
*  of their color, you know. You vote for what good they [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=518.0s)]
*  can do. You know, she can be [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=520.0s)]
*  the devil in disguise. Donors [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=522.0s)]
*  are admitting men are gone. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=524.0s)]
*  But Democrats say Kamala Harris [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=526.0s)]
*  isn't the issue. Men are. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=528.0s)]
*  And they should see a psychiatrist. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=530.0s)]
*  I think men are in crisis, actually, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=532.0s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=534.0s)]
*  I think that plays out different ways. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=536.0s)]
*  And not all men [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=538.0s)]
*  are in crisis, of course. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=540.0s)]
*  And not all men are [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=542.0s)]
*  just at home listening to Joe Robin, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=544.0s)]
*  being angry, or being [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=546.0s)]
*  recruited to fascism. Some just [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=548.0s)]
*  need therapy, like we all do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=550.0s)]
*  We need to have a real conversation about that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=552.0s)]
*  rather than allowing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=554.0s)]
*  this kind of drift [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=556.0s)]
*  toward this faux [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=558.0s)]
*  masculinity that we see [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=560.0s)]
*  Donald Trump advancing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=562.0s)]
*  Do you really think Kamala's losing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=564.0s)]
*  because men are in crisis? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=566.0s)]
*  No. Real men [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=568.0s)]
*  aren't in crisis. But these [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=570.0s)]
*  guys are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=572.0s)]
*  So, if you don't cry in front of your horse, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=590.0s)]
*  or at Love Actually, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=592.0s)]
*  you're not a real man. And you need to see [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=594.0s)]
*  a shrink who will prescribe you [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=596.0s)]
*  medication that will turn you into a zombie, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=598.0s)]
*  and allow you to enjoy being [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=600.0s)]
*  bossed around by a pretty woman. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=602.0s)]
*  I just hope that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=604.0s)]
*  all the women here tonight [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=606.0s)]
*  talk to all the men that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=608.0s)]
*  they're going to be. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=610.0s)]
*  I just hope that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=612.0s)]
*  all the women here tonight [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=614.0s)]
*  talk to all the men that they're going to be. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=616.0s)]
*  Talk to all the men that aren't here tonight. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=618.0s)]
*  And all you brave men [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=622.0s)]
*  that are here tonight. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=624.0s)]
*  Talk to all the other men [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=630.0s)]
*  that aren't here tonight. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=632.0s)]
*  And let's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=634.0s)]
*  just get it going. Enough with [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=636.0s)]
*  the fighting. Let's get to the uniting. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=638.0s)]
*  Let's get to the joy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=640.0s)]
*  That's the Democrats' idea [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=642.0s)]
*  of a brave man. Not a cop [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=644.0s)]
*  or a soldier, or a guy who gets shot [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=646.0s)]
*  and pops back up. Democrats [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=648.0s)]
*  believe a brave man goes to Kamala rallies [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=650.0s)]
*  and nags their buddies into [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=652.0s)]
*  voting Democrat. But if [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=654.0s)]
*  a pretty woman doesn't do it for you, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=656.0s)]
*  maybe the Messiah can turn you on. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=658.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, gentlemen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=660.0s)]
*  I've noticed this especially [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=662.0s)]
*  with some men [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=664.0s)]
*  who seem to think Trump's behavior, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=666.0s)]
*  the bullying and the putting people down, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=668.0s)]
*  is a sign of strength. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=670.0s)]
*  And I am, I am [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=676.0s)]
*  here to tell you, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=678.0s)]
*  that is not what real strength is. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=680.0s)]
*  Don't get it twisted, fellas. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=682.0s)]
*  This is what a real man looks like. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=684.0s)]
*  This is the kind of strapping [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=686.0s)]
*  masculinity that Democrats idolize. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=688.0s)]
*  Michelle, I'll be right up. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=690.0s)]
*  I'm almost finished my set. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=692.0s)]
*  The kind of guy that loves vanilla [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=694.0s)]
*  soft-serve. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=696.0s)]
*  Take me out to the ball game, Barry. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=698.0s)]
*  And then he told black men, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=706.0s)]
*  vote for Kamala or you ain't black. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=708.0s)]
*  We have not yet [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=710.0s)]
*  seen the same [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=712.0s)]
*  kinds of energy [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=714.0s)]
*  and turnout [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=716.0s)]
*  in all quarters [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=718.0s)]
*  of our neighborhoods and communities [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=720.0s)]
*  as we saw when I was [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=722.0s)]
*  running. I also want to say that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=724.0s)]
*  that seems to be more pronounced [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=726.0s)]
*  than the way [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=728.0s)]
*  the Democrats were [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=730.0s)]
*  when they were running. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=732.0s)]
*  I want to see more pronounced [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=734.0s)]
*  with the brothers. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=736.0s)]
*  You're coming up with all kinds of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=738.0s)]
*  reasons and excuses. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=740.0s)]
*  I've got a problem with that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=746.0s)]
*  Because, because part of it [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=748.0s)]
*  makes me think, and I'm speaking to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=752.0s)]
*  men directly, part of it [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=754.0s)]
*  makes me think that, well, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=756.0s)]
*  you just aren't feeling [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=758.0s)]
*  the idea of having a woman as president. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=760.0s)]
*  Trump says Kamala may have lost [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=762.0s)]
*  another brother. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=764.0s)]
*  Quote, I think Obama will be voting [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=766.0s)]
*  for me. Because he doesn't [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=768.0s)]
*  like the fact that Kamala [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=770.0s)]
*  is an extremely low IQ person. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=772.0s)]
*  Obama's trying to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=774.0s)]
*  glue his shattered coalition back together, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=776.0s)]
*  but it's gonna take more than [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=778.0s)]
*  Barry scolding black men as [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=780.0s)]
*  sexist race traders to win the male [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=782.0s)]
*  vote. Democrats know it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=784.0s)]
*  Why are [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=786.0s)]
*  black men being lectured to? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=788.0s)]
*  Why are black men being belittled? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=790.0s)]
*  For him to single out [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=792.0s)]
*  black men is wrong. And some of the black men [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=794.0s)]
*  that I have talked to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=796.0s)]
*  have their reasons why [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=798.0s)]
*  they want to vote a different way. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=800.0s)]
*  Unless President Barack Obama [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=802.0s)]
*  is gonna go out and lecture every other [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=804.0s)]
*  group of men from other identity [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=806.0s)]
*  groups, my message [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=808.0s)]
*  for Democrats is don't bring it here [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=810.0s)]
*  to black men who, by and large, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=812.0s)]
*  don't vote much differently [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=814.0s)]
*  from black women. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=816.0s)]
*  Woo hoo, sounds like Barry's in trouble [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=818.0s)]
*  with the ladies. So [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=820.0s)]
*  they're moving on to Plan B. Slapping [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=822.0s)]
*  a helmet on Coach Walls and throwing [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=824.0s)]
*  him into the game to tackle white [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=826.0s)]
*  guys and drag him to the polls. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=828.0s)]
*  Walls to launch media [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=830.0s)]
*  blitz to woo male voters. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=832.0s)]
*  Walls wooing dudes [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=834.0s)]
*  can only mean one thing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=836.0s)]
*  Pheasant hunts, football [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=838.0s)]
*  games, and Michael Strahan. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=840.0s)]
*  When it comes to President Biden [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=842.0s)]
*  in the presidency, do you, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=844.0s)]
*  would you or do you see anything that you would have done? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I, as a governor, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=848.0s)]
*  I, I was asked to be governor of this [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=850.0s)]
*  state when Donald Trump was president and when [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=852.0s)]
*  Joe Biden was there. I think the thing that drew [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=854.0s)]
*  me to this ticket, and I think what the vice president [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=856.0s)]
*  is talking about is that her values [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=858.0s)]
*  on these hasn't changed. So it makes me [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=860.0s)]
*  want to ask you, do you think that Biden's done [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=862.0s)]
*  everything right? Well, look, I don't know [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=864.0s)]
*  if any of us do everything right, but I can tell you he's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=866.0s)]
*  done everything in the best interest of the American [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=868.0s)]
*  public. Kamal is doing [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=870.0s)]
*  so badly with men that now she's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=872.0s)]
*  just identifying as Biden. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=874.0s)]
*  And it got worse. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=876.0s)]
*  He said, I think all of us know the electoral [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=878.0s)]
*  college needs to go. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=880.0s)]
*  But the campaign came out later that night [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=882.0s)]
*  and they said that's not their stance. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=884.0s)]
*  The campaign's position is clear, that that's not their [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=886.0s)]
*  position. Their position and my [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=888.0s)]
*  position is to make sure that everybody [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=890.0s)]
*  understands their vote no matter what state they're [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=892.0s)]
*  in matters. So that's not the day you and my [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=894.0s)]
*  president here disagree on? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=896.0s)]
*  I have spoken about it in the past, but she's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=898.0s)]
*  been very clear on this, and the campaign and my [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=900.0s)]
*  position is the campaign's position. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=902.0s)]
*  The only thing clear about that was [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=904.0s)]
*  that Coach Wall spoke [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=906.0s)]
*  at a turn and the campaign bent him over their knee [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=908.0s)]
*  and spanked him. This election [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=910.0s)]
*  isn't about men [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=912.0s)]
*  supporting women and Blacks [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=914.0s)]
*  supporting Kamala. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=916.0s)]
*  None of that identity politics matters. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=918.0s)]
*  It's about making the country [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=920.0s)]
*  better. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=922.0s)]
*  And if you've made it worse, and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=924.0s)]
*  you say you're the same [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=926.0s)]
*  as the guy who made it that way [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=928.0s)]
*  and don't have a plan to fix it, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=930.0s)]
*  then everything you're saying [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=932.0s)]
*  is just fluff. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=934.0s)]
*  So when we think about [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=936.0s)]
*  what's at stake in this election, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=938.0s)]
*  whoa, it's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=940.0s)]
*  packed with some stuff. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=942.0s)]
*  It's packed with some fundamental [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=946.0s)]
*  stuff. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=948.0s)]
*  I say rather articulately. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=952.0s)]
*  So we watched her speech, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=956.0s)]
*  so you don't have to, and we were waiting [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=958.0s)]
*  for her to tell us the fundamental [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=960.0s)]
*  stuff that's at stake. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=962.0s)]
*  And she just told a long, boring [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=964.0s)]
*  story about John McCain. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=966.0s)]
*  Meghan McCain after tweeting [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=968.0s)]
*  don't make me tell you what my father [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=970.0s)]
*  really thought about Kamala Harris. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=972.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=974.0s)]
*  Republican side, there's not a lot of scolding [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=976.0s)]
*  and bedwetting. What we see [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bwBQlvH0&t=978.0s)]
