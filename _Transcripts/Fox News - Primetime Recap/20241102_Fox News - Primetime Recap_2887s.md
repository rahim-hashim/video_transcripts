# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 1, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw)
*  But first, the new big lie. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2.2s)]
*  Now, when you can't defend your record [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=4.04s)]
*  or show how your policies are gonna lead to more peace, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=8.14s)]
*  more prosperity, what are you left with? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=10.98s)]
*  Lies, phony outrage, and hoaxes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=14.14s)]
*  And right through the homestretch of this campaign, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=17.56s)]
*  that's all Kamala Harris is offering to voters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=19.82s)]
*  Now, Trump rightly tags Liz Cheney, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=23.32s)]
*  the future Pentagon chief of Kamala wins, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=26.52s)]
*  as being a war zealot, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=29.7s)]
*  and made an offhand comment about how easy it is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=31.86s)]
*  to send other people off to fight your wars. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=34.24s)]
*  She's a radical war hawk. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=37.9s)]
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=40.34s)]
*  with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=42.44s)]
*  Let's see how she feels about it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=44.54s)]
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=46.64s)]
*  You know, they're all war hawks [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=50.06s)]
*  when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=51.42s)]
*  saying, oh, gee, Will, let's send 10,000 troops [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=53.72s)]
*  right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=58.32s)]
*  But she's a stupid person. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=60.76s)]
*  Now, everyone knows what Trump meant, and it was clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=63.26s)]
*  It wasn't saying she should be executed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=66.5s)]
*  or put for a firing squad. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=68.36s)]
*  It's a lot of what they used to say about George W. Bush [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=70.4s)]
*  and other Republicans who hadn't been in combat. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  But this didn't stop Kamala's media troops [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  to snap into action, which is what they did, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  to advance a lie that Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=81.64s)]
*  was literally calling for violence. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=83.08s)]
*  He has increased his violent rhetoric. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=84.98s)]
*  Anyone who wants to be president of the United States [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=87.98s)]
*  who uses that kind of violent rhetoric [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=90.84s)]
*  is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=94.08s)]
*  Unqualified to be president? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=100.08s)]
*  Those words came out of her mouth [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=102.16s)]
*  coming from a woman who never won a single primary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=104.36s)]
*  That's why she wants people disqualified. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=107.7s)]
*  She doesn't want to give you a choice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=109.2s)]
*  And a woman who wants to be president [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=111.36s)]
*  doesn't want to give you a choice. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=113.22s)]
*  And a woman who was such a bad boss [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=114.26s)]
*  that she couldn't keep her staff, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  which had lost 90% of them, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=117.5s)]
*  and who can't answer basic policy questions to this night, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=119.7s)]
*  she can't do it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=123.2s)]
*  Oh, but he's unqualified? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=125.14s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, with the whole election on the line, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=127.88s)]
*  the decision to double down on emphasizing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=129.5s)]
*  the importance of Liz Cheney [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=131.8s)]
*  to a future Harris administration, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  it strikes me as very risky. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=136.04s)]
*  What happened to all the joy? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=138.52s)]
*  So instead of running on an optimistic issues-based campaign, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=140.8s)]
*  Harris again has decided to embrace another vicious lie [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=144.4s)]
*  to scare voters, mostly women. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=149.0s)]
*  That's how little she thinks of you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=151.14s)]
*  She knows it's all a lie. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=153.04s)]
*  And yet Kamala Harris, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=155.84s)]
*  who's supposedly qualified to be president, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=157.04s)]
*  is repeating it anyway. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=159.58s)]
*  Now, Trump obviously clarified his obvious intent [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=162.08s)]
*  about Cheney earlier today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=164.88s)]
*  And when campaigning in Dearborn, Michigan, he added this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=166.32s)]
*  She's a war hawk. She kills people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=170.5s)]
*  She wanted to, even in my administration, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=172.76s)]
*  she was pushing that we go to war with everybody. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=175.9s)]
*  And I said, if you ever gave her a rifle [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=179.04s)]
*  to let her do the fighting, if you ever do that, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=180.94s)]
*  she wouldn't be doing too well, I will tell you right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=183.94s)]
*  She had to face the consequences of battle. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=186.24s)]
*  She wouldn't be doing it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  So it's easy for her to talk, but she wouldn't be doing it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, as for the Muslim leaders who have endorsed Trump, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=194.44s)]
*  they saw this for what it was, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=197.18s)]
*  like the mayor of Hamtranck, Michigan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=198.68s)]
*  The top military advisor of Kamala Harris is Liz Cheney, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=201.82s)]
*  the bloodthirsty person who advocates [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=207.4s)]
*  for more wars in the Middle East. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=211.6s)]
*  President Trump keeps attacking the pro-war radicals, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=213.44s)]
*  those war hawks who are the top military advisor [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=217.74s)]
*  of Kamala Harris. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Smart people, voters with common sense, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=223.24s)]
*  are onto the Democrats' game. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  They're frightening women voters, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=228.4s)]
*  and they're lying about Trump calling him Hitler [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  is their only hope now of avoiding voter wrath [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  on something that really matters, which is the economy, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  especially after today's absolute nightmare [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=237.72s)]
*  of a jobs report. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=240.66s)]
*  113,000 jobs were expected, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  but only 12,000 jobs were added. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=245.12s)]
*  We lost 46,000 manufacturing jobs, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  a lot of that from Boeing, 28,000 private payroll jobs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=250.96s)]
*  But look at it this way, kids, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=255.46s)]
*  at least the bureaucracy grew. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=256.76s)]
*  What would we do without more red tape? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=259.26s)]
*  So without government jobs, when you analyze this, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=261.64s)]
*  we'd have had a negative job growth report. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=264.5s)]
*  None, zero, negative. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=266.74s)]
*  So how does Kamala explain this? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=269.88s)]
*  Answer, she can't, she doesn't. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=272.58s)]
*  We had a jobs report came out today [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  showed that we've actually had a revision downward [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=278.06s)]
*  of the number of jobs created. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=281.18s)]
*  Actually, the new jobs report is only 10% [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=282.3s)]
*  of the number of jobs they expected to be created this month. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=283.96s)]
*  And that's a problem for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  He should be talking about that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=288.48s)]
*  But the media doesn't wanna talk about that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=290.36s)]
*  And they won't talk about it over in the Harris campaign [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=293.36s)]
*  because remember, she thinks, and she's told us, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=296.26s)]
*  that they made all the right calls. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=300.06s)]
*  If anything, would you have done something differently [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=303.14s)]
*  than President Biden during the past four years? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=307.64s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  That's still my favorite answer ever. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=314.5s)]
*  So now they've spent, printed, and borrowed $6.8 trillion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  And all they got for it was a declining jobs market, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=325.18s)]
*  declining hourly rate wages, and fat government payrolls. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=328.76s)]
*  So my friends, they've been lying all along. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=334.06s)]
*  Our blueprint together for what America can be. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=337.26s)]
*  This is Bidenomics. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=343.02s)]
*  Bidenomics is working. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=344.82s)]
*  It's working. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  We are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=347.92s)]
*  Lies, lies, and more lies. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=351.26s)]
*  Just like the border is secure, there's no migrant crisis. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=354.4s)]
*  Just like inflation is transitory, don't worry about it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=359.94s)]
*  And of course, let's not forget, Ukraine is making gains. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=364.94s)]
*  Remember last summer, wasn't that supposed to be the first [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=368.94s)]
*  time that happened? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=372.74s)]
*  All of it was untrue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=373.94s)]
*  Our people are hurting financially. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=375.98s)]
*  Women and girls are trafficked at our border. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=378.68s)]
*  Americans are victims of migrant crime. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=381.82s)]
*  And in Ukraine, hundreds of thousands are dead. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=385.42s)]
*  We don't even know how many. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=389.92s)]
*  But lies, emphatically repeated enough times, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=392.86s)]
*  look, they can become true to voters. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=396.6s)]
*  Especially people who are busy with their lives, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=399.66s)]
*  maybe they're just starting to pay attention to the election. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=402.56s)]
*  That is what Kamala's team is hoping for tonight. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's the same reason that she repeats [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=408.68s)]
*  the Charlottesville very fine people on both sides hoax. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=411.18s)]
*  It's why she sticks to the suckers and losers hoax. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=414.82s)]
*  It's why she's so cynical that she stuck [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=418.62s)]
*  with the Russia collusion, the dirty dossier hoax for so long. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=421.12s)]
*  And so it makes perfect sense that in this long, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=425.52s)]
*  tedious continuum of smears, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  they end this campaign with another lie. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's a big one. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=435.29999999999995s)]
*  And phony outrage over poor Liz Cheney. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=436.7s)]
*  Is this a smart political decision? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=441.67999999999995s)]
*  It's certainly insulting the intelligence of the voters. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  But given where their base is on the war issues, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=446.88s)]
*  and look on the Cheneys personally, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  they wanted to put Dick Cheney in the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=451.78s)]
*  International War Crimes Tribunal for goodness sakes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=453.52s)]
*  This strikes me as a bizarre strategy to end this with. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  So now Americans face a stark choice. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=461.88s)]
*  Remember Reagan in 1964 called it a time for choosing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=464.12s)]
*  And tonight the question is, will they choose Kamala [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=469.12s)]
*  and reward her record of decline, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=472.46s)]
*  and her campaign of lies and hoaxes and phony outrage, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=475.06s)]
*  or will the voters choose Trump, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  and a proven track record of success? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  And the answer is, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=486.5s)]
*  it's a choice of peace and prosperity for all the people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the choice, and that's the angle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  Democrats are on the lookout for a six foot tall, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=494.44s)]
*  81 year old who escaped the White House earlier today. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=496.98s)]
*  We're told he sounds and looks something like this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=500.08s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  is his supporters. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=505.18s)]
*  Biden doesn't have a laptop this time, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=506.72s)]
*  but he did manage to get all the way to Pennsylvania, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  and he somehow found a stage. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=511.46000000000004s)]
*  We have, we have, we retire, we have, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=513.86s)]
*  every week, we have infrastructure week. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=516.22s)]
*  After that, he tried to give a woman an award, dropped it, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=520.32s)]
*  and then he started chewing on it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=524.32s)]
*  How he's still allowed to be near a camera is a mystery. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=526.86s)]
*  Democrats thought Biden was strapped to a gurney [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=530.76s)]
*  after he ate baby feet. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=533.04s)]
*  You'd think after derailing Kamala's closing speech [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=535.14s)]
*  with that garbage grenade, he'd want to lay low, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=537.84s)]
*  you know, sit the next one out, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=540.24s)]
*  snacking on babies with Dr. Jill in a panda suit. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=542.46s)]
*  The Democrats keep trying to bench Biden, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=546.6600000000001s)]
*  but he keeps running out onto the field naked. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=548.9000000000001s)]
*  Biden's insiders say it's the World Series for politics, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  and he wants to play in it now. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  And he sees Philly and Scranton as his home field, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=558.2800000000001s)]
*  where he thinks he's beloved. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=561.8800000000001s)]
*  So he made a mad dash to Philly today, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=563.98s)]
*  but Democrats aren't too happy he's in town. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=566.08s)]
*  Quote, the appreciation from the Democratic base [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=569.2600000000001s)]
*  is still there, but the need for him to show up is not. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=571.98s)]
*  At this point, it is really all about Kamala Harris, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=576.72s)]
*  and she needs separation from Biden, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  is what one Democrat says. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=582.46s)]
*  The speeches have to be inspiring, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=584.5s)]
*  and Obama and Clinton are better suited [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=586.82s)]
*  for that task than the president. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=589.1s)]
*  That stings. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=591.84s)]
*  And Obama's speechwriter just went on CNN moments ago [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  and told Joe his time's up. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=596.5s)]
*  Should Biden even be going out on the trail [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=600.02s)]
*  for Harris at this point, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=602.16s)]
*  or is he just like too much of a risk? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=603.36s)]
*  I mean, if I was Joe Biden, and I knew, look, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=607.04s)]
*  his legacy obviously is at stake in this election, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=610.9399999999999s)]
*  and he is the president of the United States, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  got a lot of work to do as president, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=616.74s)]
*  I would probably look at the numbers, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=618.54s)]
*  I would look at the race and say, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=620.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna focus on being president for the next couple days. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=622.24s)]
*  And that's probably the best, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  that's the best thing he can do [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=627.4s)]
*  for not just the Harris campaign, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=628.24s)]
*  but himself and his legacy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=629.5s)]
*  Obama's guys are saying, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=631.56s)]
*  nice presidential library you got over there, Joe. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=633.02s)]
*  Be ashamed if something happened to it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=636.46s)]
*  Next time you think about leaving the White House, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=639.06s)]
*  think about your legacy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=641.16s)]
*  They're not afraid to put him in Walter Reed [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=643.64s)]
*  for the weekend. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=645.4s)]
*  Hunter's gonna need a new job [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=647.16s)]
*  where he doesn't have to pee in a cup, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=648.48s)]
*  and the Sugar Brothers tapped out. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=650.24s)]
*  So after this week, Democrats can't even stomach [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=652.28s)]
*  seeing Biden on the trail again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=654.28s)]
*  We're just learning that they confiscated his phone. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=656.36s)]
*  He had a bunch of campaign calls scheduled yesterday, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=660.36s)]
*  and they canceled all of them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  They just told Joe, you know the reception's spotty? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=664.82s)]
*  Try again tomorrow, and then Joe forgot. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  So they've taken away his laptop and his phone. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=670.7s)]
*  The whole White House is angry at the big guy, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=673.84s)]
*  even the White House stenographers. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=676.0s)]
*  They are now as mad as you will ever hear [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=679.2s)]
*  a stenographer on the record [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=681.88s)]
*  that White House officials working for President Biden [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=684.04s)]
*  tried to change the meaning of their transcripts. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=687.14s)]
*  So it sounded like the president on that Zoom [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=690.4s)]
*  with Voto Latino was just criticizing a comedian [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=692.26s)]
*  instead of all Trump supporters. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=696.5s)]
*  So after Biden called Americans garbage, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=698.9s)]
*  they forced the White House stenographers [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=700.86s)]
*  to rewrite the transcripts, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=702.56s)]
*  and the stenographers were like, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=704.56s)]
*  yo, you guys gotta be kidding me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=705.66s)]
*  This is a violation of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=706.98s)]
*  That's what you raided Trump's house over. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=710.42s)]
*  And Biden's guys said, just do it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=713.22s)]
*  So they did it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=715.38s)]
*  Kamala can't even believe it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=716.74s)]
*  Obama's fighting with Biden, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=718.72s)]
*  the White House is strong-arming librarians, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=720.24s)]
*  and her VP pick just called the world's richest man gay. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=722.96s)]
*  If you're a billionaire, Elon Musk, for example, say, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  that gay got a... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=730.36s)]
*  He... [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=732.0s)]
*  Michigan knows that word. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=733.64s)]
*  Look, that dude got a tax cut. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=736.36s)]
*  Tim Walz is calling the other guy gay? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=738.64s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=741.36s)]
*  He should be the... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=744.12s)]
*  Obama and Pelosi both said Walz was a poor pick, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=745.42s)]
*  that Kamala should have gone with Shapiro. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=748.58s)]
*  And it looks like Harris is having second thoughts, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=751.12s)]
*  because she's cheating on Tim Walz [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=753.96s)]
*  right in front of everyone. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=755.66s)]
*  This election, it's bigger than us. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=757.66s)]

*  Do you want more chaos? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=761.5s)]
*  Or, like me, are you ready for some common sense? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=762.86s)]
*  That's why I'm with Kamala. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=765.98s)]
*  This would be like Trump cutting an ad with Doug Burgum. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=767.84s)]
*  You can't cheat on your VP. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=771.14s)]
*  This isn't wife swap. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  Did Tim get cooed? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  I get it. Pennsylvania's do or die. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=777.14s)]
*  You expect it to be all hands on deck there. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=779.2399999999999s)]
*  So why are they sending Bill Clinton to New Hampshire? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=782.2399999999999s)]
*  When did New Hampshire become a battleground? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=785.38s)]
*  Biden was just in New Hampshire. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=787.9799999999999s)]
*  Remember, that's where he said they had to lock Trump up? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=789.4599999999999s)]
*  The last time a Democrat lost New Hampshire was 24 years ago. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=792.52s)]
*  And now Real Clear Politics is saying [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  New Hampshire's a toss-up. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=797.92s)]
*  If Trump wins New Hampshire, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=800.02s)]
*  and he hasn't even campaigned there, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=801.62s)]
*  it's gonna be a big night. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=803.48s)]
*  And Bubba's got, what, nine lives? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=805.58s)]
*  He said Trump's economy was better than Kamala's, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  and he said Lake and Raleigh would still be alive [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=809.86s)]
*  if the borders are done her job. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=812.26s)]
*  The Harris campaign must be really needy [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=814.7s)]
*  to roll the dice and let Bill lose again. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=817.1s)]
*  But Bill knows better than anyone, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=820.0400000000001s)]
*  it's the economy, stupid. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=821.9s)]
*  Some of them are Republicans by DNA. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=824.08s)]
*  Some of them voted for Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=825.78s)]
*  and have told us because of Biden's policies, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=828.44s)]
*  because of inflation, the cost of living, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=830.24s)]
*  they're going back to Trump. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=831.74s)]
*  The economy's still the top issue, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=833.28s)]
*  and today's news, not gonna help Harris. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=835.1800000000001s)]
*  The big jobs, jobs, jobs report, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=838.84s)]
*  and the prophecy came true. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=841.22s)]
*  Jobs light, 12,000. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=843.82s)]
*  12,000 in non-farm payroll. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=846.32s)]
*  That is the lightest going back to December of 2020. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=848.82s)]
*  It's a massive drop, of course, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=852.22s)]
*  from what we saw in September. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=853.6600000000001s)]
*  That number was also revised lower, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  down to 223,000 jobs. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=857.62s)]
*  In fact, what we lost was over 110,000 jobs [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=860.1800000000001s)]
*  over August and September. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=863.62s)]
*  We have 100,000 fewer jobs than we thought we had. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=864.82s)]
*  That's a really bad number. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=868.4200000000001s)]
*  So we just lost 100,000 jobs, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=871.26s)]
*  and Joe's in Pennsylvania [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=873.5s)]
*  reminding everybody about Bidenomics. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=874.7s)]
*  Democrats can make jobs disappear, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=877.4s)]
*  but they can't make Biden disappear. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=879.16s)]
*  Here was Trump reacting to the news in Michigan. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=881.4s)]
*  This is the lowest number in years, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=884.5400000000001s)]
*  pitiful 12,000 jobs last month. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=886.68s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=890.2199999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of jobs less than what it should be. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=891.62s)]
*  I never heard of 12,000 jobs. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=898.3399999999999s)]
*  That's not even believable. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=900.1999999999999s)]
*  And if she gets four more years, your family is never gonna — [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=902.14s)]
*  you're never gonna recover from these stupid people. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=905.0999999999999s)]
*  There'll be a 1929-style economic depression [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  that will absolutely crush your incomes and all that stuff. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=911.9799999999999s)]
*  But we're not gonna talk about that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=915.34s)]
*  because we wanna — we wanna make sure we win. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=916.98s)]
*  And when we win, you are four days away from the best jobs, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=920.52s)]
*  the biggest paychecks, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=924.6600000000001s)]

*  So the Biden economy looks like a mirage, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=930.5s)]
*  and Kamala still can't give us a concise answer [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  of what she's gonna do if she wins. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=935.3000000000001s)]
*  Day one, what's your first executive action? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=937.86s)]
*  Well, my first priority, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=940.3000000000001s)]
*  which will be probably the package of bills, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=941.86s)]
*  is about bringing down the cost of living. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's about housing. It's about childcare. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=945.88s)]
*  It's about what we need to do to deal with grocery prices. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=948.14s)]
*  So it's not one, but it's a package. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=951.02s)]
*  So why do they even keep asking her [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=954.12s)]
*  what she's gonna do on day one? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=955.68s)]
*  Day one was four years ago. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=957.38s)]
*  She could knock on Joe's door right now and say, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=959.38s)]
*  hey, big guy, sign this executive order. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=961.26s)]
*  I'm gonna just slip it under your door. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=963.72s)]
*  I know they took your phone, but there's a pet in there somewhere. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=965.56s)]
*  Why should Americans wait until Inauguration Day for help [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=968.6s)]
*  when Kamala's in power now? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=972.06s)]
*  Why can't she get a head start on the things she's promising? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  This election's gotten so ridiculous, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  they made J.Lo cry. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=980.0s)]
*  I promised myself I wouldn't get emotional, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=987.18s)]
*  but you know what? You know what? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=989.42s)]
*  We should be emotional. We should be upset. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=994.06s)]
*  We should be scared and outraged. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  Luckily, Trump will protect J.Lo, whether she likes it or not. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1000.36s)]
*  But why can't Kamala Harris get emotional about America like J.Lo? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1004.62s)]
*  This country's been through a lot the last four years. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1008.4s)]
*  How is it that Harris is never upset by any of it? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1011.3s)]
*  She just laughs along like nothing's wrong. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  And are Democrats running out of celebrities? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1017.3s)]
*  Hollywood must be empty at this point. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1019.74s)]

*  Just calling everyone Nazis. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1037.3799999999999s)]

*  This election is about whether the Democratic machine [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1077.4s)]
*  can kill off the incumbent [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1079.88s)]

*  accusing Cheney of being a war hawk, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1201.36s)]

*  without ever having to fight a war, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1206.64s)]

*  the state-run media mob, they have zero fidelity to truth. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1882.24s)]
*  Instead, they have an unyielding rage for Trump. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1886.84s)]
*  They have contempt and hatred for his supporters. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1889.9199999999998s)]
*  They have nothing but contempt for the American people. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1892.72s)]
*  And right now they have proven they will do and say anything, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1895.48s)]
*  anything to cling on to power. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  Zero fidelity to truth at this point. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1902.32s)]

*  All right. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1910.56s)]
*  So before we get to some news stories, let's do this. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1911.44s)]
*  Gregg's Leftovers. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1915.72s)]
*  It's Leftovers where I read the jokes [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1920.0s)]
*  we didn't use this week. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1921.6s)]
*  And as always, it's my first time reading them. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1922.56s)]
*  So if they suck, we'll dress Joe Mac as a baby [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1924.66s)]
*  and send him to meet Joe Biden. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1927.1200000000001s)]

*  for Halloween at an event at the White House. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1938.4s)]
*  And as you can see, Joe dressed as his favorite character [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1942.32s)]
*  from The Walking Dead. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1945.16s)]
*  But it makes sense for Jill to dress up like a panda. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1949.36s)]
*  After all, she's owned by China and never has sex. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1952.04s)]
*  Joe loved her costume, saying he always wanted [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1958.0s)]

*  So what makes a lesbian haunted house? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1974.96s)]
*  Well, for one, they keep the lights on. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1977.12s)]
*  A new study shows there's not enough time in the universe [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1987.8s)]

*  the works of Shakespeare. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1993.0s)]
*  But for a few bananas and a pot of coffee, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=1994.92s)]

*  A group supporting Kamala released an ad [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2020.1200000000001s)]

*  having nothing in common with the people [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2322.44s)]
*  that they claim to cover. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2324.44s)]

*  And that's because they're starting to see [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2373.44s)]
*  the reaction to a possible Trump win is only selfish. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2375.44s)]
*  They're not saying, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2378.44s)]
*  Hmm, maybe we should change how we do things. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2380.44s)]
*  It's more like, Crap, what does this mean for our careers? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2382.44s)]
*  They'll likely triple down and start calling Trump [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2385.44s)]
*  Hitler, Stalin, Kilmeade. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2388.44s)]
*  But if Trump wins, they assume they screwed up, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2393.44s)]
*  but if Kamala wins, they won't. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2396.44s)]
*  So by their own admission, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2398.44s)]
*  they're copping to choosing the wrong side. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2400.44s)]
*  Instead of admitting to the failure [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2403.44s)]
*  of choosing a side to begin with. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2405.44s)]
*  Even if Harris were to win, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2407.44s)]
*  they still won't admit to their professional corruption. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2409.44s)]
*  And if Donald wins, their only change won't be [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2412.44s)]
*  to rethink the bias of their cloistered bubble, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2415.44s)]
*  but actually lean into advocacy even more. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2418.44s)]
*  The original premise of their industry [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2422.44s)]
*  was to show people the world. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2424.44s)]
*  Now it's to show the world who they are. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2426.44s)]
*  Rather than reflect reality, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2428.44s)]
*  they reflect their terminal arrogance. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2430.44s)]
*  And so their reputations are worse than P. Diddy's, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2432.44s)]
*  but they still keep applying the baby oil. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2435.44s)]
*  It's like the news is a zombie that doesn't know it's dead, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2440.44s)]
*  but still walking around trying to do the same things [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2444.44s)]
*  over and over. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2447.44s)]
*  No wonder they protected Biden and now Kamala. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2448.44s)]
*  They thought they were one of them, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2451.44s)]
*  all in search of brains. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2453.44s)]
*  Todd, it's always okay to see you. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2462.44s)]
*  Fair. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2466.44s)]
*  Mediocre. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2467.44s)]
*  All the bland words. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2468.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2470.44s)]
*  You know, do you honestly think, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2472.44s)]
*  okay, if Trump wins, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2474.44s)]
*  that there will actually be any reflection on the media [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2475.44s)]
*  for what they've done, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2478.44s)]
*  or will they just simply triple down? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2480.44s)]
*  No, they'll triple down. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2482.44s)]
*  This article was the reflection, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2483.44s)]
*  but what was so asinine about this article, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2485.44s)]
*  they blamed Trump for the article [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2487.44s)]
*  that they took that is going to lead to their extinction. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2489.44s)]
*  The plan would have been simple, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2492.44s)]
*  and they would still be alive and have a future [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2494.44s)]
*  if they just followed, to your point, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2496.44s)]
*  what their marching orders were at the outset. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2498.44s)]
*  Provide unbiased facts, let the audience decide, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2501.44s)]
*  but instead they got TDS, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2504.44s)]
*  they got Trump Derangement Syndrome, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2506.44s)]
*  and their entire focus was on getting Trump, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2508.44s)]
*  and they threw facts to the side. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2511.44s)]
*  That's why they're so upset about it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2513.44s)]
*  They're so upset about it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2515.44s)]
*  They threw facts to the side. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2517.44s)]
*  That's why they're going extinct. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2519.44s)]
*  You watch Fox. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2521.44s)]
*  Even Trump gets mad at Fox sometimes [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2523.44s)]
*  for putting Democrats on. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2525.44s)]
*  Why do we do that? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2526.44s)]
*  Because we need to present both sides of the issue [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2528.44s)]
*  that the other networks don't. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2530.44s)]
*  That's why we're relevant. They're not. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2532.44s)]
*  That's actually a really good point, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2534.44s)]
*  and I'm surprised it came from you. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2536.44s)]
*  Understood. Thank you. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2538.44s)]
*  People get all crazy when, like, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2540.44s)]
*  why is this person on the five? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2543.44s)]
*  I understand that it makes your arguments better [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2545.44s)]
*  if you are... [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2547.44s)]
*  You can't have a Bond movie without a Bond villain, you know? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2549.44s)]
*  Then you just have some guy in a tuxedo masturbating. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2552.44s)]
*  But... [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2555.44s)]
*  Wait, that... [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2557.44s)]
*  I want to... What movie did you watch? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2559.44s)]
*  That wasn't a Bond movie. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2561.44s)]
*  But my point is... [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2563.44s)]
*  My point is... [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2565.44s)]
*  What was my point? My point... [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2567.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. My point... [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2569.44s)]
*  It was his Wednesday night. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2571.44s)]
*  My point is, the difference between Fox and, say, MSNBC [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2575.44s)]
*  is that we know what the other people are thinking [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2579.44s)]
*  because we have those people here. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2582.44s)]
*  So we don't get surprised. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2584.44s)]
*  We actually understand that there's another world out there. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2587.44s)]
*  They don't. Therefore, they are suddenly realizing... [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2589.44s)]
*  They'll be like, here's a Republican, Liz Cheney. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2593.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2595.44s)]
*  That's true. They have fake Republicans. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2597.44s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that they might be realizing [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2600.44s)]
*  they're irrelevant? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2602.44s)]
*  Well, I think that's one of the reasons why you see people [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2604.44s)]
*  like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2607.44s)]
*  refusing to endorse Kamala Harris when normally, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2609.44s)]
*  in, you know, ordinary times, they would have been so quick [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2612.44s)]
*  to endorse the Democratic nominee. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2614.44s)]
*  I think they're realizing right now they don't want to be [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2616.44s)]
*  on the wrong side of history. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2618.44s)]
*  A lot of people are realizing that because right now [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2620.44s)]
*  we are seeing the mainstream media take us down [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2622.44s)]
*  a very deranged, dark path. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2624.44s)]
*  Even Kamala Harris has said it so many times. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2626.44s)]
*  Her favorite line is, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2628.44s)]
*  I think she's really turned the page [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2630.44s)]
*  on the last three and a half years. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2632.44s)]
*  Not realizing she's actually telling people [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2634.44s)]
*  they need to vote for Trump. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2637.44s)]
*  Obviously, we don't want to get to an ultra-optimistic situation [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2639.44s)]
*  like too soon. Everyone still needs to go out and vote. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2642.44s)]
*  It is so important. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2644.44s)]
*  But I just keep thinking of the best-case scenario. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2646.44s)]
*  I definitely see Trump finishing out his term. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2648.44s)]
*  I would love to see J.D. Vance having his time in the sun. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2651.44s)]
*  I would love to see... [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2654.44s)]
*  I would love to see... [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2656.44s)]
*  ...Baron Trump even further the legacy. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2658.44s)]
*  Wow, you are... [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2660.44s)]
*  I'm going... Go big or go home, right? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2662.44s)]
*  Yeah, wow, you're going away. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2664.44s)]
*  I mean, apparently there's a lot of women at NYU [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2666.44s)]
*  who want to date Baron Trump now. Even their moms are calling, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2668.44s)]
*  saying, this is the boy you need to, you know, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2670.44s)]
*  make it happen with. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2672.44s)]
*  I think a lot of elites, though, are seeing the same thing. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2674.44s)]
*  And they're starting to hedge, right? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2676.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2678.44s)]
*  Somebody get Greg a tuxedo. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2680.44s)]
*  Every time I wear a tuxedo, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2682.44s)]
*  penguins try to rape me. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2684.44s)]
*  Kat, this whole thing... [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2686.44s)]
*  I actually was a good point in the New York issue [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2688.44s)]
*  about when they deplatformed Trump, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2690.44s)]
*  it pushed him to create his own ecosystem, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2692.44s)]
*  and now they're brewing that day. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2694.44s)]
*  There's actually a pretty good point there, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2696.44s)]
*  but what do you say? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2698.44s)]
*  Yeah, because when... [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2700.44s)]
*  The more he talks, then there was the more chance [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2702.44s)]
*  of them to have to find things to latch on to, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2704.44s)]
*  or he said this and da-da-da-da. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2706.44s)]
*  And I think that's a good point. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2708.44s)]
*  I think that's a good point, too, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2710.44s)]
*  where he said this and da-da-da-da. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2712.44s)]
*  Look, I mean, I feel like everybody's pretty confident [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2714.44s)]
*  right now that Trump's gonna win. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2716.44s)]
*  I do think he will, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2718.44s)]
*  but also it's possible he wouldn't [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2720.44s)]
*  because men don't vote. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2722.44s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2724.44s)]
*  Overwhelmingly more women generally [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2726.44s)]
*  actually go out there and vote [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2728.44s)]
*  than men do. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2730.44s)]
*  It scares me because I hear that about Pennsylvania, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2732.44s)]
*  and it's like, dudes, you gotta get out there, man. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2734.44s)]
*  Maybe they will, maybe... [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2736.44s)]
*  It's interesting to see. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2738.44s)]
*  I mean, even people are saying it, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2740.44s)]
*  you know, okay, don't be surprised. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2742.44s)]
*  Don't be surprised, which I don't think anybody would be. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2744.44s)]
*  But, I mean, whether they actually... [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2746.44s)]
*  Answering a poll is one thing, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2748.44s)]
*  and going out and voting is another. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2750.44s)]
*  Mm-hmm. All right, Tyrus. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2752.44s)]
*  Make me feel comfortable about Tuesday. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2754.44s)]
*  He's gonna say it's not close. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2756.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2758.44s)]
*  It's not close. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2760.44s)]
*  And the reason why is it's not even about Kamala. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2762.44s)]
*  Kamala is just who they are. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2764.44s)]
*  Kamala is just who they put up there. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2766.44s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2768.44s)]
*  It is about the spitting in the face of the American way, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2770.44s)]
*  and most importantly, the American man [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2772.44s)]
*  and the American family. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2774.44s)]
*  Bud Light tried to... [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2776.44s)]
*  We saw what happened. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2778.44s)]
*  And it wasn't the people who made videos and complained. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2780.44s)]
*  It was the people who said, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2782.44s)]
*  we're not buying your product anymore. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2784.44s)]
*  This is an American movement because we've said enough. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2786.44s)]
*  And President Trump is benefiting from that, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2788.44s)]
*  not from his warm personality, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2790.44s)]
*  but the fact that he was saying, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2792.44s)]
*  you want policies, you want things fixed. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2794.44s)]
*  I'm willing to do that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2796.44s)]
*  They're like, we're gonna listen to you. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2798.44s)]
*  The other side doesn't say anything because they're convinced [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2800.44s)]
*  the American people are dumb. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2802.44s)]
*  We don't know what's good for us. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2804.44s)]
*  That's why they can put someone like Kamala forth [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2806.44s)]
*  who cannot put a f----- sentence together [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2808.44s)]
*  that makes sense to any voter. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2810.44s)]
*  So this isn't even about her. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2812.44s)]
*  And this is a put the foot on the neck moment [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2814.44s)]
*  to where the American people are gonna be heard so loud [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2816.44s)]
*  that they'll be like, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2820.44s)]
*  the time you decide to run the government yourself, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2822.44s)]
*  we will not be there. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2826.44s)]
*  Because that's what this is really about. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2828.44s)]
*  Joe Biden was not running this country. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2830.44s)]
*  You spit in the intelligence of the American people. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2832.44s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2834.44s)]
*  But here's the thing, no matter what happens on Tuesday, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2836.44s)]
*  there are still worse things that you could hear [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2840.44s)]
*  besides your person not getting in. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2844.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2846.44s)]
*  Roll it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2848.44s)]
*  We're gonna be okay. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2850.44s)]
*  Um, that's me. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2852.44s)]
*  That's me as Janelle from 16 and Pregnant. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2854.44s)]
*  Aw. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2856.44s)]
*  Aw, man, my guy didn't get in the White House, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2858.44s)]
*  and then I get a phone call. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2860.44s)]
*  Hey, Dad, nothing else worse can happen. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2862.44s)]
*  There's always something worse. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2864.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2866.44s)]
*  We must move on. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2868.44s)]
*  We're gonna be okay. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_Cstng9Bw&t=2880.44s)]
