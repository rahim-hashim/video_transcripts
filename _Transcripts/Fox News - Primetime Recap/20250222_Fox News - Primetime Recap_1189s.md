# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 21, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE)
*  Advance with Vance. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Last summer Dem and media type spent a lot of time trash talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's VP pick. Could Kamala Harris have picked a better contrast to J.D. Vance who I think in opposite to Walls to know [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=15.16s)]
*  that guy is to really detest that guy. You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=25.5s)]
*  record and some of what he is running me are saying. It's just plain weird. Tim Walls over there who was the first one to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=33.02s)]
*  actually call J.D. Vance and Donald Trump weird. And then look at the rest of them. Maga make American great again. How about [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=40.38s)]
*  the Republican Party. And then there's of course J.D. Vance. Of course people might just be searching for the word weird and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=46.74s)]
*  associating with Republicans. They're in advance trance. Yeah. And now we know why they were so hot last summer to smash him. And [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=52.339999999999996s)]
*  it was in Vance's childish late cat lady comments which were hilarious by the way. Instead it was because they knew how [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=61.86s)]
*  effective he'd be because like Trump the man never stops. He never backs down from a fight. Last week he laid waste to the euro [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=70.46s)]
*  globalists who think U.S. taxpayers should be their forever bankers. I've heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=79.16s)]
*  from. And of course that's important. But what it seemed a little bit less clear to me and certainly I think to many of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=86.84s)]
*  citizens of Europe is what exactly it is that you're defending yourselves for. It was a seismic message felt around the world [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=94.24s)]
*  and a much needed wake up call for our allies. Now one of the best things about Vance is how he schools these impudent news anchors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=104.28s)]
*  who usually take the side of foreigners over Americans. In fact we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=113.8s)]
*  properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks on our country. That happened during the campaign if you may [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  remember. So clearly not all of these foreign nationalists have been properly vetted. But my primary concern as the vice president [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=127.12s)]
*  Margaret is to look after the American people. And now that we know that we. Masterful on policy. Yeah of course he is. But Vance's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=135.8s)]
*  cultural message is just as important. My message to young men is I think that our culture sends a message to young men that you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=144.96s)]
*  should suppress every masculine urge. You should. You should try to cast aside your family. You should try to suppress what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=154.4s)]
*  makes you a young man in the first place. And I think that my message to young men is don't allow this broken culture to send [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=165.4s)]
*  you a message that you're a bad person because you're a man because you like to tell a joke because you like to have a beer with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  your friends or because you're competitive. Also very important and a vice president of course is he never forgets who's in the driver's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=181.24s)]
*  seat. He's got the best sense of humor of any American political figure. But I think this is why young men in particular are so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  you know that they're so inspired by President Trump is because he doesn't allow the media to tell him he can't make a joke or he [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  can't have an original thought. President Trump just says what's on his mind. That's a damn good thing. And it's a good example to set for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=207.0s)]
*  young men in American culture. And he's right. Of course he's right. Young men love Trump. Men ages 18 to 29 voted for Trump by a 14 [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=215.0s)]
*  point margin. The Washington Post notes that it's the first time a GOP presidential candidate claimed an outright majority of the group since [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=225.0s)]
*  1988. But why did Republicans in the past struggle with this group. Well first of all we all know big media sometimes at the urging of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=233.12s)]
*  government officials always stepped in to help the Democrats. The Biden administration did more to destroy free speech not just in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=243.24s)]
*  United States but also in Europe than any administration in American history. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  Again he's relentless. He's always on the offensive. He's reminding Americans about why cutting wasteful spending is critical for our economic [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=257.0s)]
*  survival. The third thing that he's tried to do of course with the help of Elon and all the great folks at Doge is ask what are we doing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=267.68s)]
*  with all of the American taxpayers money and why are we wasting so much of it on garbage that the American people either aren't aware that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=278.04s)]
*  we're spending it on or don't want to be spending it on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  Hundred percent right. It's very effective. Now when you watch these clips you watch the entire speech which you should. You understand why Trump [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  picked him in the first place. Again it's a genius of Donald Trump and he was excoriated for picking Vance as you recall. And so far the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  MAGA base they couldn't be happier and they're so happy that Vance is already shaping up to be the runaway choice of the MAGA [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=305.72s)]
*  supporters to be Trump's successor. The New York Times today is reporting on the quote quieter efforts that are underway to position [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  Vice President Vance as Mr. Trump's eventual successor and also revealing that Vance is expected to lead some of the legislative battles [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  over Mr. Trump's agenda. The administration's chief lobbyist in the Senate and he's also assigned to help oversee the potential sale [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=331.76s)]
*  of tick tock. Well one thing's clear they're definitely not treating him like Biden's people treated Kamala in the first few years as [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=341.23999999999995s)]
*  an afterthought. She couldn't she couldn't get arrested because no this wears Kamala. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=350.0s)]
*  His brain power is just beyond dispute and the caliber of people surrounding Trump in general. It's just superb. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  But in promoting J.D. Vance and other populace you know from the millennial generation showcasing them being confident enough to do that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=364.44s)]
*  President Trump is not making the mistake of Reagan who remember did not leave the party in the greatest of hands. Trump is deciding at [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=373.88s)]
*  least for now that he's going to leave this MAGA coalition in great hands. One that's going to be around for decades to come. And that's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=382.36s)]
*  the angle. Elon's nerd army's having fun maybe a little too much fun. I said what trait do they really have and the trait that they really [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=392.44s)]
*  have was that they're extraordinary with computers. They can take them. He said they make love to their computer. I said I don't want to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  hear about that. Doesn't sound too. I don't care what Big Balls does to his computer whatever he's doing is working. AOC on the other [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=407.52s)]
*  hand not satisfied. She wants to know who Big Balls thinks he is. Every day our job is to wake up and say what can I do today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=416.64s)]
*  There is no act too small that that does not matter. Every single action matters. And so when they try to come in make them make them [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=429.36s)]
*  show a warrant make them show a document make them assert their authority ask them who are you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=443.08s)]
*  Who are you. Because at the end of the day there no one and he's running around because he thinks he's got a bank account with a lot of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=453.0s)]
*  zeros in it that it makes him some kind of super citizen. I don't think so. Who do you trust with your money. A guy with a bank account [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=461.52s)]
*  full of zeros or a lady who rents an apartment with her fiance and earmarks five hundred thousand dollars for an anti racist oyster reef in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=470.48s)]
*  Queens. Don't eat oysters off the coast of Queens. It's just common sense. Like why have we spent 16 billion for California's high speed [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=477.88s)]
*  rail and there's still no rail. They're over a decade behind schedule and they keep asking for more money. So this California [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=489.6s)]
*  Republican said enough is enough. And liberals response was rational. They hit her with a tomato. Activists at L.A.'s Union Station chant [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=497.24s)]
*  build that rail. Democracy is almost dead. One dressed as a dinosaur. Another appears to throw a tomato at a Republican assembly member. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=506.64s)]
*  Who's going to pick our tomatoes. We heard when Trump shut down the border apparently anti dozers dressed as dinosaurs are. Secretary of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=517.52s)]
*  Transportation Sean Duffy showed up with a message for him. Listen I want to address the protesters for a moment if I could. I think they were [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=526.24s)]
*  chanting build the rail. It's been 17 years and 16 billion dollars and no rail has been built. So if you want to go protest somewhere if you [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=534.88s)]
*  want to shout at someone go to the governor's mansion go talk to Democrats in the legislature who have brought us this crappy project. We're [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=544.88s)]
*  done with it. And you know what. You're going to have people who love fraud who love waste who love trains to nowhere. This is a boondoggle. They [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=553.64s)]
*  should ask the question who didn't build my rail. Who got rich. What consultants what politicians what politicians husbands got rich off of this money. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  California handed a bunch of politically collected contractors 16 billion almost 20 years ago and there's no train. But Biden just kept sending [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=573.88s)]
*  checks with no questions asked. He's a train guy. But you can't just keep pumping money into a boondoggle. You got to pull the plug. And that's what [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=583.52s)]
*  Duffy did. California is on their own. Trump's forcing the left to be pro fraud waste and abuse and boondoggle. Listen to the media. Americans voted for [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=591.9399999999999s)]
*  you on the immigration and the economy. But these voters say they're angry and frustrated by these firings. They don't like the work of Elon Musk and these [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=602.28s)]
*  other actions. What do you say? Who do you work for? I work for ABC News. Who? ABC News. No wonder. Let me just tell you. Let me just tell you that I have [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=609.72s)]
*  today the highest poll numbers I've ever had. They like the job that we're doing. They like the job that Elon's doing. He's doing something that a lot of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=622.28s)]
*  people wouldn't have the courage to do. We want to streamline our country. We want to streamline. You know why? Because we want our country to survive and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=628.62s)]
*  thrive. And we're finding billions and billions of dollars of waste fraud and abuse. Billions. And I mean numbers like you wouldn't believe. And we [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  haven't even started yet. For so many years Republicans have been scared to cut spending and fire bureaucrats because of the blowback. Trump's been shot. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=646.12s)]
*  And if he lost the last election he'd be in jail. He's not worried about political blowback. He's doing it because it's the right thing to do. He's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=655.2s)]
*  invincible to the hurricane of negativity from the legacy press. This should be the playbook going forward. And Republicans don't have to get shot to do it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=663.44s)]
*  You campaign on something you win and you do it. That's what Thomas Jefferson had in mind. And if the press doesn't like it sorry guys. Elections have [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=673.4000000000001s)]
*  consequences. I love how the media takes a few critics when the overwhelming response from the American people is support for what this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=682.8800000000001s)]
*  administration is doing. I think all Americans would agree that funding mastectomies in Mozambique is not something that the American people should be [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=692.88s)]
*  funding or D.E.I. programs. I think it's fraudulent that the American government has been ripping off taxpayers in this way. Why is the media so against [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=702.84s)]
*  cutting waste fraud and abuse from the government. I don't get it. We won't be deterred. We will not be deterred from people like you and the press who are [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=712.16s)]
*  clearly adamantly opposed to cutting waste fraud and abuse. We shut down the entire country for two years. Three. And the Democrats loved it. They wanted to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=720.28s)]
*  keep it shut down longer. No one worked. The schools closed. Whole government agencies stopped functioning. And now we're shutting down what less than one [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=730.96s)]
*  percent of the government only the government not the U.S. economy. And Democrats are calling it a civil war. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=740.4s)]
*  Entire agencies for the whole pandemic they weren't issuing any new regulations. They weren't approving new permits. The Durham investigation just [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=747.32s)]
*  stopped for a year. No one was even going to federal court. The only people who worked in the government were essential employees. Everybody else [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=758.28s)]
*  stayed home. Ninety percent of the government wasn't essential. Now all of a sudden everyone's essential. Everyone. How'd that happen. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=768.8s)]
*  They're still not going into the office. Hi everyone. Kelly Leffler it's my second day here at the SBA. I could not be more excited to be here. So [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought I'd take a walk. And what I found is that exactly what's been said is true. About 90 percent of our employees are working from home. Well [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=788.92s)]
*  that ends Monday with President Trump's order to return to work. Trump has a mandate to modernize American government. And in the course of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=797.8399999999999s)]
*  that process we're finding a sickening level of corruption and kickbacks. American voters didn't vote for pork. The politicians took our money and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=805.7199999999999s)]
*  that's what they turned it into. President Trump came to town. A new way of thinking. They're shuttering agencies. They're shutting people down. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=814.12s)]
*  They're finding things like two million dollars spent in Guatemala for sex changes. Three million dollars spent in Brazil for a girl centric [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=823.04s)]
*  climate change. Four point eight million dollars spent in Ukraine for social media influencers. While you're at it we spent not we but the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=832.16s)]
*  people who vote for this. I voted against all of this. But the members of the Senate who voted for this spent several hundred thousand dollars [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=842.72s)]
*  spending. Designers in Ukraine to the fashion show in Paris. It goes on and on. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=849.76s)]
*  Why are we handing Ukrainians five million bucks to make tick tocks. Is that what for war propaganda. Because you can do it for a lot less than [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=859.08s)]
*  five million. Kamala doesn't even pay influencers that much money. We're sending Ukrainian designers to Paris Fashion Week. Is that like a sex [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  trafficking operation. Because it sounds pretty Jeffrey Epstein. Overnight Elon's team dozed ninety five bad contracts saving you one [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=878.28s)]
*  hundred and fifteen million dollars. But Democrats say fraud. It's not a big deal. There is a lot of waste fraud and abuse in the federal [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=887.2s)]
*  government. I'm not going to say that there's a lot. I'm going to say that it does exist. I'm going to say that exists. I don't think that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=896.48s)]
*  there's a lot. No. Crockett should ask folks on the street about spending 20 million for Iraqi Sesame Street. We did. He found that we're [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=903.24s)]
*  spending 20 million dollars on Sesame Street in Iraq. Sesame Street in Iraq. What's Sesame Street supposed to. I think all the kids know [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=914.52s)]
*  they want to read the ABC's. What. And that's not 20 million. Hell no. Do you want to spend your tax paying dollars on Sesame Street in Iraq. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=925.36s)]
*  System is sweet in Iraq. The way this works is we vote for politicians and politicians vote to spend money. The politicians will say yeah we'll [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=936.6s)]
*  give 40 billion to foreign aid. But they're not itemizing everything like oh yeah I want 16 million for a climate change institute for [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=946.32s)]
*  transsexuals in Transylvania. Now some unelected bureaucrat is deciding that. And if your house just burned down in Pacific Palisades and you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=954.98s)]
*  hear we're throwing money out the window like this you're going to have a heart attack. Doge is just doing what families all do tightening [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=964.36s)]
*  their belts when the credit cards maxed out. These layoffs aren't personal. They're not even really political. It's basic arithmetic. We're [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=972.14s)]
*  sorry if some federal employees might lose their job. We are. But they work for us. And clearly 36 trillion dollars later it's not working. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=981.14s)]
*  One Doge government scientists complain saying they're presenting us as trophies. No that's what Soros Junior does with politicians he owns [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=991.58s)]
*  a bought and sold politician. Now that's a trophy. Look at that. No one's holding you up to the cameras like a big mouth bass. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1002.58s)]
*  Everyone got offered buyouts. Everyone from the government's been working from home for four years. It's time to move on like the rest of the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1009.86s)]
*  country did a long time ago. Next stop the post office. You want to have a post office that works well and doesn't lose massive amounts of [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  money. And we're thinking about doing that. And it'll be a form of a merger but it'll remain the postal service. And I think it'll operate a lot [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1028.38s)]
*  better than it has been over the years. Commerce is going to swallow up the post office just like states swallowed up USAID. All of these [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1037.86s)]
*  agencies freelancing are out of control. It's costing us billions. We're operating like foreign countries within our own government. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  Trump's licking his chops over Fort Knox. All my life I've heard about Fort Knox. That's where the gold is kept. Right. I heard Fort Knox. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1054.3s)]
*  But you know we're getting a little bit shaky. We're getting the yips on this stuff like I want to find out. So we're going to open up the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1063.26s)]
*  doors. I'm going to see if we have gold. We want to find out. Did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox. It's a pretty amazing place. But I'm [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1068.78s)]
*  going to actually go we're going to open the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox. We want to make sure that we actually have you know [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1076.46s)]
*  400 tons of gold or whatever the hell it is. It's a lot of gold. I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare. There better be gold in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1081.86s)]
*  that vault or else there's no golden age. My wife used to work in the gold business and they used to do annual vault checks in person to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1090.5s)]
*  verify the physical gold was in the vault. It's basic due diligence. But somehow Fort Knox goes years without a spot check. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1099.02s)]
*  All of these directives that Trump's putting in place can be wiped out by the next president. So Congress is going to set it into [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1108.9s)]
*  concrete. The president is over 300 executive actions already and we're going to codify so much of what he's doing so that the next team can't [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1116.74s)]
*  unwind it. Hmm. Republicans control Washington. So now it's time to get serious. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1126.82s)]
*  So when the Republicans lay out this year's budget everything Doge is doing is going to be worthless if they don't get it together. If we were [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1132.82s)]
*  fiscally conservative why wouldn't we take the savings from Elon Musk and Doge and move it over here and help with the border. Why would we be doing a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1142.86s)]
*  brand new bill to increase spending by three hundred and forty billion dollars. Republicans have a golden opportunity to use chainsaw Musk. We've been [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1153.06s)]
*  given a gift. Musk even gave himself a deadline year and a half and then he's going to go back to colonizing Mars. Trump's not running again so [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1162.34s)]
*  there shouldn't be any fear. So let these young men make love to their computers for the good of the country. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8bJhLQYjjE&t=1172.18s)]
