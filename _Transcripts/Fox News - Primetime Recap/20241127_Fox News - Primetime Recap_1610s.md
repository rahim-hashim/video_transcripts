# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 26, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0)
*  But first, thank you, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=3.04s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=5.0s)]
*  I was so nervous a few weeks ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=9.44s)]
*  A flight attendant whispered those words [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=11.88s)]
*  in my ear this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=14.32s)]
*  An hour later, another stranger, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  I don't know, it was about 35 or so [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=17.56s)]
*  with a wife and a few small children, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=19.36s)]
*  approaches me and says, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=21.96s)]
*  what a great Thanksgiving this one's gonna be. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=23.46s)]
*  No, I've heard this time and again in recent weeks, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  and you know why. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=29.2s)]
*  If y'all don't get up and do the Trump dance, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=31.0s)]
*  because everybody's doing it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=34.04s)]
*  The entire world is happy that Donald Trump is bad baby. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=36.0s)]
*  Young man, that's how they shoot you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=41.08s)]
*  I say it in young man. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=44.32s)]
*  Young man. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=46.56s)]
*  Stunk. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=51.32s)]
*  Of course, I get it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a self-selecting group. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=54.32s)]
*  The Trump supporters are in a good mood. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=55.72s)]
*  But I still think America is feeling more hopeful [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  this holiday. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=60.76s)]
*  People are breathing a sigh of relief. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  They can actually speak their minds [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=64.9s)]
*  and not worry perhaps about getting fired [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=67.5s)]
*  or getting penalized or getting canceled. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=69.9s)]
*  And isn't it time to stop fighting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=72.6s)]
*  and start having some fun? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=74.58s)]
*  A constant state of turmoil and fury [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  should not be our natural state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=79.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no! [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=82.32s)]
*  Why, why, why? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=87.28s)]
*  I am ashamed to call myself an American. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=91.58s)]
*  In fact, I no longer call myself an American. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Wake up! [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=99.62s)]
*  This is f***ing America, and this is sad. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=101.0s)]
*  It's so sad, really, and so hilarious, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  but it is mostly sad. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=109.0s)]
*  And just think of how the anti-Trumpers invested [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=111.06s)]
*  in Judge Mershon's sentencing of Trump in Manhattan. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=114.58s)]
*  I want the judge to give him six months. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=118.48s)]
*  I worked in the West Wing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=120.86s)]
*  To be eligible to work in the West Wing, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=122.02s)]
*  you have to qualify for a top-secret security clearance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=123.76s)]
*  Felons can't get top-secret security clearances. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=126.4s)]
*  When you spend a year in prison in New York or under, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=128.94s)]
*  you serve in Rikers Island, okay? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=132.84s)]
*  Ooh, the audience goes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  I love watching these clips now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=140.24s)]
*  Thank God this Thanksgiving that Americans did not fall [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=142.78s)]
*  for that twisted and wishful thinking, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=146.98s)]
*  including, by the way, young people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=149.92s)]
*  We should be so grateful to voters 30 and under [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=151.98s)]
*  who turned out for Trump in numbers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=155.18s)]
*  we haven't seen since Reagan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=157.06s)]
*  It turns out young people, they don't want to go through [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=159.16s)]
*  another four years of declining opportunities [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=161.22s)]
*  and high prices. Why should they? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=163.76s)]
*  Today, they're giving Donald Trump's transition handling [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=165.96s)]
*  a staggering 65% approval. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=169.16s)]
*  And by the way, not just young people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  More Hispanic and African-American voters [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=175.7s)]
*  turned out for Trump and tuned out the lies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  They see MAGA more as an opportunity and not as a threat. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  But bumbling Biden, he sold it so hard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  Extreme movement of America, the MAGA Republicans, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=189.98s)]
*  led by a defeated president, is trying to steal history now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=192.98s)]
*  And thank God enough Americans are over Obama as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=197.64s)]
*  We do not need four years of a wannabe king, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=203.78s)]
*  a wannabe dictator running around [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=209.62s)]
*  trying to punish his enemies. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=211.22s)]
*  America's ready to turn the page. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  We are ready for a better story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=214.66s)]
*  Georgia, we're ready for a president, Kamala Harris. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=216.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=220.16s)]
*  And speaking of talents past their expiration date, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=222.26s)]
*  I want to thank God that Oprah's going to somehow [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  squeak by this holiday season with the paltry payday [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=228.72s)]
*  her production company made from Kamala's campaign, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  poor baby. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=235.32s)]
*  After all, she's such a political savant. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=236.62s)]
*  We don't get to sit this one out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=240.26s)]
*  If we don't show up tomorrow, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=244.1s)]
*  it is entirely possible that we will not have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=251.34s)]
*  the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=256.12s)]
*  And thank the good Lord for the voting public [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=260.02s)]
*  who put Donald Trump over the top [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=262.6s)]
*  and who are still happy with their choice. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  A new Emerson poll shows 54% of Americans [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  have a favorable view of Donald Trump now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=270.0s)]
*  That is a record high for him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  Now the list of what we should be grateful for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=276.88s)]
*  goes on and on. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=279.38s)]
*  Now remember, some of the so-called political experts [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=280.82s)]
*  warned that candidate Trump should stick to the economy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=283.68s)]
*  and the border and stay away from the culture war issues. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=288.18s)]
*  Well, as usual, Trump relied on his gut [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=291.96s)]
*  and he ignored their advice. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=295.16s)]
*  We will get critical race theory [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=297.04s)]
*  and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  We will keep men out of women's sports. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=305.0s)]
*  That's like a no brainer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=307.08s)]
*  And it turns out we can be very thankful [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=310.08s)]
*  that it looks like Trump broke woke. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=312.82s)]
*  The largest retailer in the United States [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=316.32s)]
*  is dumping its diversity, equity and inclusion charade. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=318.0s)]
*  Walmart is pulling back on diversity, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=321.8s)]
*  equity and inclusion programs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Why the changes? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=326.64s)]
*  What we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=328.0s)]
*  every associate feels welcome here to shop [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=331.48s)]
*  and to feel like they belong. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=334.68s)]
*  And we're going to continue to make the best decisions we can [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=336.32s)]
*  that makes everyone, our customers, our associates [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=339.48s)]
*  feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=342.42s)]
*  All right, that's a really long-winded way of saying, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=346.12s)]
*  we're listening to our consumers now who think woke is a joke. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=348.02s)]
*  Trump doesn't just know how to read the room, people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=352.5s)]
*  He reads the country. Case in point, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=355.9s)]
*  his announcement yesterday that he's planning significant tariffs [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=358.8s)]
*  to crack down on fentanyl and other border related issues. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank God. Now remember, tariffs are to free trade absolutists. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=365.28s)]
*  What sunshine is to vampires. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=370.2s)]
*  But real people see their utility [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  and the leverage that tariffs provide. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=375.94s)]
*  According to that same CBS News poll, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=378.68s)]
*  52% of Americans support using tariffs on imported goods. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  Smart. Trump now has everyone's attention. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  And suddenly, I predict we're going to see [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=388.58s)]
*  even fewer migrants and less fentanyl [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=391.82s)]
*  coming across the border. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=394.46s)]
*  More on China's bluster response later on in the show. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=396.3s)]
*  And we'd be remiss on the angle [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=400.4s)]
*  in not being supremely grateful for Elon Musk, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=403.06s)]
*  not only for his generous support of Trump [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=407.34s)]
*  in the final months of the campaign, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=409.44s)]
*  and that was generous, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=410.94s)]
*  but for his foresight in buying Twitter. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=412.64s)]
*  I think it's a very tough call about whether or not [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=416.78s)]
*  Republicans could have won without him and X. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=421.32s)]
*  Free speech won the day and the election, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=426.38s)]
*  and deranged never Trumpers who urged that Trump be censored, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=429.12s)]
*  and they were in the, you know, pushed Musk and others [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=433.5s)]
*  like RFK and Tulsi Gabbard and Nicole Shanahan [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=436.6s)]
*  out of the Democrat Party and into the Trump coalition. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=439.46s)]
*  And of course, there would be no coalition without Trump himself, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=444.5s)]
*  the master communicator. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=448.3s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=451.94s)]
*  I don't think he knows what he said either. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  Look. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=455.78s)]
*  Trump the fighter, Trump the pragmatist, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=458.28s)]
*  Trump the peacemaker. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=462.64s)]
*  I will end the war in Ukraine, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  which would have never started if I was president. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  And I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=475.82s)]
*  And of course, Trump the meme generator. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  He makes politics fun again, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  and shouldn't we start taking that whole pursuit of happiness [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=485.62s)]
*  thing seriously at this point? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  I think sometimes as conservatives, and it's true, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=491.72s)]
*  we're always on the lookout for the traps, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=495.0s)]
*  the obstacles, the challenges, the potholes, the landmines. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  But this should be a time for hope. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=502.38s)]
*  We have achieved amazing victories this year, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=505.70000000000005s)]
*  victories that few predicted in January 2021, not even I. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=509.22s)]
*  And now we have an incredible opportunity, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=514.0s)]
*  the best in decades, to build a better world [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=516.64s)]
*  for our children and our grandchildren [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=520.48s)]
*  and expand this coalition to all 50 states. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=522.62s)]
*  And speaking of kids, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=526.78s)]
*  I am really thankful for my children, Maria, Demetri and Nico. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=528.76s)]
*  Yeah, teenagers drive me crazy, of course, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=533.26s)]
*  but what would life be without that kind of crazy? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm grateful for you, the viewers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=539.84s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=542.66s)]
*  The rage in Cajun, James Carville told Democrats [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=543.88s)]
*  to do the walk of shame. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=546.62s)]
*  And we know how good Democrats are at following orders. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=548.12s)]
*  So they lined Kamala right up for an early Thanksgiving Apology Tour. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=551.3s)]
*  The outcome of this election, obviously, is not what we wanted. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=556.5s)]
*  It is not what we worked so hard for. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=560.24s)]
*  But I am proud of the race we ran. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=562.9s)]
*  You knocked on doors, you called friends, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=565.24s)]
*  you called in favors. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=568.48s)]
*  You said, hey, you know, I showed up at your softball game, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  now I need you to show up at the campaign office. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=574.5s)]
*  And I know this is an uncertain time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=578.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm clear-eyed about that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=580.58s)]
*  I know you're clear-eyed about it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=582.44s)]
*  And it feels heavy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=585.12s)]
*  And I just have to remind you, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=587.88s)]
*  don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=591.82s)]
*  And it wasn't just Harris. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=594.86s)]
*  Tim Walz had to apologize. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=596.36s)]
*  And the whole campaign did, too. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  Wilmington was ordered to report to Obama World and explain themselves. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=600.54s)]
*  But they're still full of it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=605.22s)]
*  I can sound like making excuses. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=608.76s)]
*  This political environment sucked, OK? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=610.62s)]
*  We were dealing with ferocious headwinds. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=613.46s)]
*  And I think people's instinct was to give the Republicans [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=616.26s)]
*  and even Donald Trump another chance. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=620.3s)]
*  So we had a complicated puzzle to put together here [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=622.34s)]
*  in terms of the voters. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=625.2s)]
*  And it was going to take a little bit more independent Republicans. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=626.6s)]
*  We have to understand that what happened in this election and what didn't. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=629.28s)]
*  And, you know, I think at the end of the day, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=634.08s)]
*  we had to raise people's concern [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=636.92s)]
*  and the threat level of a Trump second term. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=640.32s)]
*  That was the guy Obama sent in to help run the Kamala campaign. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=644.12s)]
*  And he just said, we had to say Trump was a fascist. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=647.7s)]
*  We had nothing else to go on. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=650.46s)]
*  We also learned how fake the polling was. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=652.64s)]
*  The Kamala campaign admitted they were never ahead. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=654.9s)]
*  Ever. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=658.44s)]
*  We didn't get the breaks we needed on Election Day. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=659.98s)]
*  There was the Biden-Trump 1.0, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  which is obviously pretty catastrophic in terms of where the race stood. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=663.98s)]
*  When we got in, my recollection is some of that snapped back. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, we were behind. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=670.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think it surprised people because there was these public polls [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=672.1800000000001s)]
*  that came out in late September, early October, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  showing us with leads that we never saw. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  Kamala's internals never had her in the lead. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=681.1400000000001s)]
*  But they were telling donors they were going to win. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=683.7s)]
*  They just needed more money. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  And then they took the money and gave it to Oprah. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  There has been, even from some folks, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=690.32s)]
*  anonymously at least, inside the campaign, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=692.36s)]
*  some critique of some of the spending decisions around things like [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=694.26s)]
*  the set for Caller Daddy, you know, renting the Sphere, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=698.36s)]
*  that sort of stuff. Do you think when all of the... [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=702.02s)]
*  When you guys have done all the books, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=705.2s)]
*  that whether the DNC will be in debt at the end of this race? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=706.8s)]
*  We had some unique things that we had to do in this race. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=709.84s)]
*  You know, you can look at, did we get the best deal here? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=713.64s)]
*  This was quite costly here. It's quite expensive. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=715.9s)]
*  At the end of the day, though, I think the ma... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, if you look at the spend we had, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=722.14s)]
*  the majority of the money we spent, it was to reach voters. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=724.08s)]
*  Reach voters? You dodged Rogan. And Rogan was free. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  We wanted to do it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=731.32s)]
*  It, you know, I hate to repeat this over and over, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=733.76s)]
*  but it was a very short race with a limited number of days. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=737.1600000000001s)]
*  And for a candidate to leave the battleground [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=740.62s)]
*  to go to Houston, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=745.18s)]
*  which is a day off the playing field in the battleground, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=748.36s)]
*  you know, getting that timing right is really important. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=753.1s)]
*  So we had discussions with Joe Rogan's team. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=757.9s)]
*  They were great. They wanted us to come on. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=762.0s)]
*  We wanted to come on. We tried to get a date to make it work, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=764.4s)]
*  and ultimately we just weren't able to find a date. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=767.88s)]
*  Let me get this straight. You were in Texas, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=770.8399999999999s)]
*  but you weren't able to find a date to do Rogan, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=772.9s)]
*  the hottest podcast in the country? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=775.5s)]
*  They were never gonna do Rogan. That was a suicide mission. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=777.88s)]
*  They knew Kamala couldn't hang in there with him for three hours. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=781.08s)]
*  She couldn't survive the view. Then they said Kamala was brave [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=784.48s)]
*  and never ducked an interview. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=789.02s)]
*  Real people heard in some way [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=792.06s)]
*  that we were not going to have interviews, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=794.72s)]
*  which was both not true and also so counter [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=797.66s)]
*  to any kind of standard that was put on Trump, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=801.86s)]
*  that I think that was a problem. And then on top of that, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=804.5s)]
*  we would do an interview. And to Stephanie's point, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  the questions were small and processy and about like... [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=810.2s)]
*  Stump. Just dumb. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=815.38s)]
*  They were not informing a voter [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=817.1800000000001s)]
*  who was trying to listen to learn more or to understand. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=819.14s)]
*  And, you know, I think back and think [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=822.88s)]
*  we should have signaled more of our strategy early on [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=825.02s)]
*  about podcasts and who we were trying to reach, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=827.82s)]
*  but being up against a narrative that we weren't doing anything [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=830.04s)]
*  or we were afraid to have interviews is completely bullsh... [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  BS? Harris waited five weeks to do her first interview, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=837.92s)]
*  and she brought Timmy along to hold her hand on CNN. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=842.02s)]
*  And when her internal polling had her down in the fall, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  Obama made her do the media blitz, remember? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=849.1s)]
*  And she choked so hard on Bret Baer, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=851.54s)]
*  her team threw in the towel. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=853.5s)]
*  Remember they were waving off camera, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=854.9s)]
*  Stop! Shut it down. Enough. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=856.42s)]
*  Behind the scenes, Democrats are saying this. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  It's incompetence at the end of the day. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=861.62s)]
*  I think they need to get rid of people. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=864.56s)]
*  But Kamala thinks she's safe. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=867.14s)]
*  She's been burning up the phones from her Hawaiian vacation, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=868.9s)]
*  telling donors she's ready to get back in the fight for 28. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=872.14s)]
*  And the donors are like, are you kidding me? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=875.98s)]
*  I think this disqualifies her forever. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=878.92s)]
*  Forever. If you can't run a campaign, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=882.62s)]
*  you can't run America. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=885.64s)]
*  The same thing is going to follow Harris [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=887.34s)]
*  for the rest of her career. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=889.54s)]
*  She cannot be trusted with the money. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=890.54s)]
*  And the donors are going to be like, where is this money? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=892.58s)]
*  Kamala's campaign manager is about to get canceled. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=896.96s)]
*  She might be out of politics for good. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=899.62s)]
*  Gen. O'Malley Dillon, she was a Biden lady [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=901.86s)]
*  who never really wanted Kamala on the ticket [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=904.76s)]
*  in the first place, leaked to the Post [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  that Kamala should be dumped from the ticket. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=908.8s)]
*  And then when Joe got dumped, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  she took over Kamala's campaign and stabbed her in the back. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=913.06s)]
*  That's what Democrats are saying. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=917.0s)]
*  You know how girls can get. They're saying, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=918.8s)]
*  quote, we don't really know why Gen didn't like her. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=920.74s)]
*  But Biden's still getting most of the blame, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=925.04s)]
*  not for destroying the country [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=927.3s)]
*  and putting the Democrats on a path to disaster. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=928.54s)]
*  No, they just think he should have dropped out sooner. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=930.54s)]
*  Biden not taking any blame at all. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  He's acting like he won. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=936.38s)]
*  The lame ducks letting Ukraine fire our missiles into Russia. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  Scranton, Joe's even lost Michael Moore. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=942.06s)]
*  Quote, seriously, this is your legacy? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=944.6999999999999s)]
*  This is how you want to go out in a blaze of horror? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=947.3s)]
*  Like if Joe's got to go, we all got to go with him? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=950.8399999999999s)]
*  Right into World War III? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=953.54s)]
*  We're hearing rumblings in Democrat circles [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=955.88s)]
*  that it's gotten so bad that Bernie Sanders [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=957.88s)]
*  is thinking about officially leaving [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=960.3399999999999s)]
*  and starting a third party. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=962.48s)]
*  James Carville says Democrats are living in the dark. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=964.88s)]
*  I and every other, in my opinion, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=968.32s)]
*  everybody else is living in the dark. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  So when you live in the dark, what do you do? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=974.0600000000001s)]
*  You try to turn the... white out. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=976.14s)]
*  I mean, turn on the flashlight. Let's see where we... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=978.64s)]
*  Because we're just stumbling around, hitting walls, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=981.28s)]
*  you know, tripping over furniture. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=984.88s)]
*  And let's see how we get there. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=987.18s)]
*  I don't know anybody that really knows this. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=989.72s)]
*  People will call me and say, do this or do that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=994.4s)]
*  But I'm trying to find the right switch here, dude. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=997.64s)]
*  And I can't... The wall is blank right now. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1000.34s)]
*  But I'm... It's... [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1002.3000000000001s)]
*  We are... fooling around in the dark here. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1004.34s)]
*  That I know. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1007.94s)]
*  You notice what we're not hearing about? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1009.04s)]
*  What got Kamala into this mess? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1011.38s)]
*  It's how Joe Biden governed the country. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1014.28s)]
*  His policies killed us. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1016.78s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't have printed a gazillion dollars [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1019.12s)]
*  and spent it on electric cars and windmills [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1021.12s)]
*  so people couldn't afford bacon. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1023.02s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't have invited the Third World in [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1024.9s)]
*  and handed them hotel rooms and debit cards. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1026.9s)]
*  If Biden had stayed in, he was doomed. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1030.0s)]
*  Kamala was doomed. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1032.8s)]
*  She had no message, no vision, and all her team did was lie. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1035.0s)]
*  Trump was an unstoppable force destined to retake the White House. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1038.9s)]
*  He had a record and a story to tell. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1043.28s)]
*  Two brushes with death and look great in a Mickey D's apron. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1045.74s)]
*  If Trump lost, he was going to prison. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1049.98s)]
*  He put his life on the line to win. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1053.1s)]
*  Democrats put your life on the line to win. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1055.88s)]
*  They sacrificed you to hold power. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1059.44s)]
*  The raging Cajun thinks they could have done even more. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1062.82s)]
*  I want to show you... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1066.72s)]
*  This is a seasoning... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1068.76s)]
*  called slap your mama. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1071.5s)]
*  So you say, well, James, you do anything to win. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1072.7s)]
*  You had this wonderful relationship with your mother... [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1075.1s)]
*  with your mother, uh, mutual idolatry, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1079.7s)]
*  which a lot of mothers and sons had in Louisiana, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1083.5s)]
*  in the documentary. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1087.24s)]
*  And would you slap your mama to win an election? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1088.5400000000002s)]
*  Of course I would. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1092.68s)]
*  And you know what else? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1093.98s)]
*  If I told my mama, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1095.5800000000002s)]
*  mama, I got to slap you to win. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1097.42s)]
*  And she said, son, is that going to help you close the sale? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1100.6200000000001s)]
*  I said, yes, ma'am. She said, go ahead and slap me. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1103.22s)]
*  Go ahead and slap me. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  You do anything you can to win. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1107.3200000000002s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity and happy early Thanksgiving to everyone. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1110.6000000000001s)]
*  So much to be grateful for to all of you across the country. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe even Alec Baldwin, who is once again in a very dark place, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1118.0s)]
*  along with Sharon Stone. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1121.88s)]
*  Now, even though his manslaughter case was dismissed, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1124.44s)]
*  he's still deeply ungrateful and is now trashing the American people, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1127.44s)]
*  calling you uninformed. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1131.7800000000002s)]
*  We'll tell you what his comments are. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll tell you what Sharon Stone's comments are. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1135.0600000000002s)]
*  But first, after four long, miserable years under Biden and Harris, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1136.92s)]
*  American optimism is now back in a big way. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1141.5600000000002s)]
*  Look at this. According to a new CBS poll, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1144.72s)]
*  most Americans now believe our best days are ahead of us. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1146.6000000000001s)]
*  And frankly, they are nearly 60 percent approve of Donald Trump [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1150.3000000000002s)]
*  and his presidential transition. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1154.0s)]
*  This after an election where voters of nearly every age race, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1156.2800000000002s)]
*  they made the shift to Donald Trump. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1160.5400000000002s)]
*  Voters want Trump to fix what the Democrats have broken. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1162.8200000000002s)]
*  And tonight, big progress already underway. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1165.8s)]
*  After Donald Trump threatened to impose heavy tariffs on both Mexico [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1168.84s)]
*  and Canada over illegal immigration. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1172.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, Mexico's president just announced that migrant caravans [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1175.54s)]
*  will no longer be permitted to reach the U.S. border. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1179.1399999999999s)]
*  Wow. While also trying to save face by promising to retaliate with a trade war. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1182.4199999999998s)]
*  My advice unsolicited to the president of Mexico. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1188.06s)]
*  Be careful what you wish for, because you're going to lose badly. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1191.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Canada's far left prime minister. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1195.1s)]
*  We like to refer to him as little Justin Trudeau. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1197.74s)]
*  He appears to be in a state of panic and is now promising to do [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  whatever it takes to maintain a good relationship with the U.S. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1204.6799999999998s)]
*  Take a look. I had a good call with Donald Trump last night again. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1208.12s)]
*  We obviously talked about [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1212.9199999999998s)]
*  letting out the facts, talking about how how the intense [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1215.62s)]
*  and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1219.76s)]
*  We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1224.2s)]
*  It was a good call. It's it's this is something that we can do. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1228.0s)]
*  Laying out the facts, moving forward in constructive ways. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1234.4s)]
*  This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1239.24s)]
*  and that's what we'll do. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1242.68s)]
*  Well, we have a new sheriff in town. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1244.22s)]
*  That means it is time for our allies, our friends to act like allies and friends. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1245.78s)]
*  Securing our border is infinitely more difficult [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1250.26s)]
*  when Canada and Mexico refuse to secure their own borders [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1253.42s)]
*  and uphold their own immigration laws. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1257.4s)]
*  Now, the same goes for our own cities, our own states. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1259.74s)]
*  Last night, right here on this program, Donald Trump's incoming border czar, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1263.04s)]
*  Tom Homan laid out a very clear warning to any mayor or governor [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1266.64s)]
*  who will obstruct federal deportation and, well, not abide by federal law. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1271.18s)]
*  Take a look. Me and the Denver mayor, we agree on one thing. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1277.08s)]
*  He's willing to go to jail. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1281.04s)]
*  I'm willing to put him in jail because there's a statute. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1282.64s)]
*  It's title eight. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1285.88s)]
*  Nice. United States Code 1324, a triple I. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1286.82s)]
*  And what it says is, it's a felony if you knowingly harbor and conceal [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1289.72s)]
*  an illegal alien from immigration authorities. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1293.66s)]
*  It's also a felony to impede a federal law enforcement officer. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1295.92s)]
*  So if we don't want to help, that's fine. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1298.76s)]
*  He can get the hell out of the way. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1300.5s)]
*  But we're going to go do the job. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1301.7s)]
*  President Trump has a mandate of American people. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1303.3s)]
*  We got to secure this country. We got to save American lives. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1305.56s)]
*  The madness, the suffering will soon be over. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1308.26s)]
*  So this year, Americans, as we head into Thanksgiving, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1311.78s)]
*  well, you can be grateful and thankful that our country's illegal immigration crisis, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1315.26s)]
*  you know, that allows terrorists and murderers and rapists and cartels [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1320.26s)]
*  and gang members, all caused by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is about to come to an end. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1323.96s)]
*  I'm grateful for one. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1328.8s)]
*  And as for the flow of deadly fentanyl into the country, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1330.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is vowing to cut it off right at the source. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1333.34s)]
*  That means China, the president elect now threatening to levy [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1336.76s)]
*  even more tariffs against China if the communist regime [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1340.64s)]
*  does not stop producing and shipping the fentanyl [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1345.4s)]
*  to Mexico and other places into North America. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1349.88s)]
*  At the same time, Donald Trump is also promising to tackle rising prices [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1353.44s)]
*  right here at home. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  As all of you know, the primary driver of inflation has been government spending. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1358.96s)]
*  Biden's lavish expenditures over the past four years. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1363.92s)]
*  It has destroyed household wealth, making almost everything unaffordable. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1367.9s)]
*  You pay more for everything you buy in every store you go to. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1372.8s)]
*  For example, the total cost of a Thanksgiving dinner is now up nearly 20 percent [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1375.7s)]
*  over 2019 from housing to food to transportation. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1380.8s)]
*  The cost of everything has got to come down. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1385.0s)]
*  Thankfully, Donald Trump is planning to make America more affordable [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1387.48s)]
*  again through several key measures. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1391.0800000000002s)]
*  That includes cost cutting efforts recommended by the new Department of Government Accountability. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1393.4s)]
*  Also, Americans will have more money in their pockets. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1399.06s)]
*  No tax on tips. Brilliant idea. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1401.9s)]
*  No tax on overtime. Another great idea. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1404.3s)]
*  That helps hardworking Americans. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1407.18s)]
*  In other words, the people that make our country great, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1409.94s)]
*  the really great people in our country that work hard, play by the rules, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1413.18s)]
*  pay their taxes, obey the laws, raise their kids and are struggling. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1416.52s)]
*  They're going to save more of their hard-earned money. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1421.6799999999998s)]
*  Also, watch the price at the pump sink as Donald Trump will ramp up energy production in short order. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1424.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is planning to reduce regulations across the board, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1431.9199999999998s)]
*  but especially when it comes to energy. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1435.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, I know you have the far left climate cult. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1437.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, they will no longer have a seat at the table. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1440.3s)]
*  Bye bye. Truth is making a comeback. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1443.26s)]
*  Common sense is making a comeback. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1446.1s)]
*  Government tithing will not make their planet healthier. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1448.42s)]
*  Windmills don't reduce pollution. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1452.3600000000001s)]
*  Paper straws, I hate them. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1454.96s)]
*  They do nothing to save planet Earth. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1456.8s)]
*  Nuclear energy, it is clean, it is effective. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1459.2s)]
*  Natural gas, it is clean, it is abundant. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1462.14s)]
*  There is nothing wrong with your gas stove, and you should be able to buy the car of your choice, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1465.04s)]
*  eat the food that you like, have the refrigerator, air conditioner, washer and dryers that you want, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1469.7s)]
*  and live your life without compromise. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1474.98s)]
*  That's called freedom. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1477.14s)]
*  The way forward is through free will, individualism, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1478.42s)]
*  not government regulation, mandates, higher taxes, and government control. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1482.06s)]
*  That's why the president-elect is also now planning to end several of Biden's [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  multi-billion dollar vote buying schemes on day one. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1492.76s)]
*  That includes his unconstitutional student debt relief program. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1496.24s)]
*  Of course, all these common sense measures, they will be met with breathless hysteria [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1500.14s)]
*  by so many, the legacy media mob, by Democrats on the left, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1506.4199999999998s)]
*  you know, one New York state senator now considering a radical plan, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1510.76s)]
*  calling for her state, along with Connecticut and Vermont and other states, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1515.3s)]
*  to secede from the U.S. and join Canada. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1520.5s)]
*  I'd like to stay the United States of America, but if they feel that strongly about it, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  I won't get in their way. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1528.04s)]
*  Now, sadly, Trump derangement syndrome is still very real. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1529.6399999999999s)]
*  And there is no doubt that America faces big challenges in the coming years. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1533.1s)]
*  But we have been through worse. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1537.3999999999999s)]
*  We've been through a civil war. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  We've been through two world wars, the rise of Nazism, fascism, communism, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1540.16s)]
*  not the way liberals talk about it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1545.56s)]
*  The U.S. won a decades long cold war and we never had to fire a shot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1547.78s)]
*  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1552.6s)]
*  The American people have created almost every major advancement in the modern world [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  because of something called capitalism, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1561.68s)]
*  the greatest wealth producing system ever designed by man. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1564.56s)]
*  We can fix inflation. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1568.8s)]
*  We can bring back law and order and safety and security. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1570.42s)]
*  We can fix the border. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1573.66s)]
*  And our morally corrupt federal bureaucracy can be dismantled. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1575.18s)]
*  All Americans can dream big again, thanks to all of you. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1579.2s)]
*  You all showed up. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1583.1s)]
*  You all voted. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1584.22s)]
*  This Thanksgiving, I'm grateful for all of you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1585.34s)]
*  We now have a fighting chance to rescue this great country, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1588.06s)]
*  secure the future for generations to come. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1592.2s)]
*  Maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyV4encF2P0&t=1595.8s)]
