# Fox News Highlights - April 28th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0)
*  Liberal exposure, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=0.0s)]
*  Every day that goes by that Trump's in office, we learn more about how dedicated he is to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=3.04s)]
*  saving our nation state and at the same time how dedicated the Democrats are to shattering [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=16.88s)]
*  Now, if there were any doubt, I mean any doubt whatsoever about the Democrats' true intentions [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=17.88s)]
*  with immigration, those have been totally wiped out in just three months of Trump 2.0. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=22.96s)]
*  Now when he started deporting, they started grandstanding and filing lawsuits. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=28.88s)]
*  They want open borders at all costs, which means protecting the criminals at all costs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=34.54s)]
*  And when they say, well, of course we support deporting violent criminals, that's meaningless [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=40.28s)]
*  and it's also untrue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=44.76s)]
*  The White House put up yard signs of the worst aliens arrested so far and listen to the exasperated [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=47.22s)]
*  reaction over at MSDNC. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=54.04s)]
*  They put them up on the driveway of the White House. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=57.32s)]
*  What's particularly noteworthy about this location is it is right directly behind the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=60.16s)]
*  positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=65.12s)]
*  So therefore, no matter what network you're on, that includes MSNBC, if you're doing a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=69.72s)]
*  hit from the White House right now, those pictures will be behind you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=75.52s)]
*  Okay, they're forced to report the truth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=80.44s)]
*  That's what they don't like. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=84.12s)]
*  It's like at my kid's school, if you give a certain amount of money, you know, you get [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=85.68s)]
*  your name up on the driveway. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  But this is the truth of what Biden did. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=91.44s)]
*  He released criminals into America and the press avoided as much as it could reporting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=93.12s)]
*  this for four years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=98.06s)]
*  And now, as I said, they're being forced to, which makes them very uncomfortable and mad. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=100.48s)]
*  They didn't report on people like 49-year-old Rasmain Sankara of Burkina Faso. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  He was arrested just last week. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=111.26s)]
*  His criminal history? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  He was convicted in New York for rape in the first degree. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=114.54s)]
*  Or Jose Chicas Martinez of El Salvador. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  He was arrested last month. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=121.76s)]
*  He was convicted in the state of Virginia for aggravated sexual battery of a victim [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  who was less than 13 years of age. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  And that's just to name a few. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=130.9s)]
*  Now the reality is much worse. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=133.74s)]
*  The White House released a list of 100 of the worst of the worst illegals. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=135.0s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=140.94s)]
*  But Democrats insisted all these people were honor roll students and future engineers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=141.94s)]
*  How insulting that always was to the families of the victims, to legal immigrants who did [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=148.32s)]
*  it the legal way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=153.44s)]
*  And how insulting to the victims themselves, to the pain that they endured because Biden [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=155.6s)]
*  allowed these animals into this country and then released them into our communities. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=160.72s)]
*  He attacked her. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=167.24s)]
*  He dragged her 150 feet, blood gushing from her head. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=170.76s)]
*  It left 150 foot trail of her blood to the culverts where he took, he picked her up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  He threw her against the wall, the tunnel, and he raped her. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=185.42s)]
*  To Democrats, yeah, that's a little sad, but it's all collateral damage. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the pain they pretend to care about, the children of illegals being deported with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=198.0s)]
*  their parents. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=203.28s)]
*  I understand this child's mother entered this country illegally, but isn't there some basis [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=204.28s)]
*  for compassionate consideration here? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  Children aren't deported. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=212.02s)]
*  The mother chose to take the children with her. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=213.02s)]
*  When you enter a country illegally and you know you're here illegally and you choose [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=214.78s)]
*  to have your assistant child, that's on you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=218.44s)]
*  That's not on this administration. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  If you choose to put your family in that position, that's on them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=222.34s)]
*  Having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally is not a get out of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=225.46s)]
*  jail free card. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make you immune from our laws. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  Thank God for Tom Holman. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=233.28s)]
*  I said that at least 10 times a day. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=234.28s)]
*  He exposed CBS there and Margaret Brennan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=236.16s)]
*  It's obvious now that the left, the Democrats, they never cared about the child separation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=240.28s)]
*  issue. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=245.36s)]
*  The kids were just anchors for more illegal immigration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=246.56s)]
*  Here Trump is keeping the families together in their home countries. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=250.56s)]
*  And the media is complaining? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=254.58s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=255.58s)]
*  They're exposed again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=256.58s)]
*  And speaking of absurd, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who thinks America will rally [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=259.14s)]
*  for his C-word attack on Trump's border and deportation policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=263.6s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=268.54s)]
*  But I am now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=275.38s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=276.82s)]
*  They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=281.46s)]
*  that we have. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=286.32s)]
*  We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=287.4s)]
*  And at the buffet line. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  What's cruel are the horrid high taxes and soft on crime policies that drive Illinois [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  residents to flee his state. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=301.96s)]
*  The point is, Trump is delivering results here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=305.52s)]
*  Only nine illegals have been released into the United States from Inauguration Day through [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=308.8s)]
*  April 1st. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  Okay, I don't know why any are released, but ever. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  But for some perspective here, on a single day under Biden, go back to December 22nd, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=316.88s)]
*  2023, 4,832 illegals were released. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=321.72s)]
*  The human smuggling cartels, right now at least, are largely giving up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=326.48s)]
*  The massive drop in the border encounters also tells the tale. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=331.02s)]
*  Here at Biden administration, we averaged over 11,000 many days, over 12,000, some days [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=335.2s)]
*  15,000 illegal entrance to the United States. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=341.32s)]
*  15,000. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=345.12s)]
*  You know what the number was last 24 hours? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=346.12s)]
*  178. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=351.12s)]
*  15,000 to 178. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=352.12s)]
*  Unprecedented success. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=355.32s)]
*  Again, understand this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=357.2s)]
*  This success, which is keeping Americans safe, infuriates the Democrats. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=360.34s)]
*  They prefer our immigration policy to be written by, let's say, the UN. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  They do not recognize as legitimate our right to bar the entry of any migrants whatsoever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  And they're mistaken in believing that Americans are going to vote based on these immigration [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=379.3s)]
*  sob stories. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=383.82s)]
*  Some of these individual cases are resonating with people and they're like, yeah, I want [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=385.36s)]
*  stronger border security, but that doesn't feel good to me with these human stories. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=389.62s)]
*  Liberals are so committed to open borders and fast tracking citizenship and voting [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=394.62s)]
*  rights for illegals, they'll actually risk losing election after election on this issue. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  That's a definition of a fanatic. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=404.46s)]
*  And they can't hide it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=406.56s)]
*  We cannot count how many of their judges act like they're running strategy for the ACLU's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=408.62s)]
*  migration project. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=414.34s)]
*  That horrid Milwaukee judge arrested for obstruction of immigration enforcement. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=416.41999999999996s)]
*  Come on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=420.61999999999995s)]
*  This has been going on though for years. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=421.61999999999995s)]
*  Massachusetts, it's teeming with immigration advocates in black robes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=423.94s)]
*  Sneaking illegals out back doors of courtrooms to evade arrest by ISIS. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  Juveniles are stupid. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=434.53999999999996s)]
*  It's also lawless. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=435.82s)]
*  Remember, the Democrats are post-America. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=437.82s)]
*  You have to understand that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=441.7s)]
*  They do not believe that the United States is a legitimate nation state or that our [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=443.28s)]
*  borders have any moral significance or that our citizens should have any privileges that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  are not shared with the rest of the world. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=453.44s)]

*  exact same set of legal and constitutional rights as American citizens. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=465.32s)]
*  And they promote these goals every single day. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=470.3s)]
*  And they will never stop unless they are defeated so badly and so often that they're forced [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=473.78000000000003s)]

*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump got some brotherly love at the White House today. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=488.78000000000003s)]

*  The season started off slow, but you soon caught fire with your great coach inspiring [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=498.8s)]
*  you and you got the ball to your superstar running back who I met yesterday. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=504.2s)]
*  And I want to tell you, he is he's a handsome guy, but I wouldn't want to tackle him. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=509.6s)]
*  Saquon Barkley. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=515.88s)]

*  no, I don't think so. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=523.72s)]

*  Running back Saquon Barkley spent the weekend golfing at Bedminster. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=533.32s)]
*  Democrats hate when black stars like Saquon chill out with Trump and they threw a fit. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=537.2s)]
*  But none of that matters anymore. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=543.0s)]
*  Saquon said some people are really upset because they played golf and flew to the White House [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=544.92s)]
*  with the president. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=549.96s)]
*  Maybe I just respect the office. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=551.2s)]
*  Not a hard concept to understand. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=553.38s)]
*  I just golfed with Obama not too long ago and look forward to finishing my round with Trump. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=555.76s)]
*  We're living in a different world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=562.16s)]
*  In 2018, the Eagles boycotted their White House visit and now they're visiting and getting [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=563.52s)]
*  in a round. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=568.56s)]
*  The culture is embracing Donald Trump because just like in sports, Trump's about results. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=570.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter what you say, it's how you play. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=575.4s)]
*  Your opponent and your critics, they can say whatever they want. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=578.26s)]
*  But the only thing that matters is the score at the end of the game. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=581.24s)]
*  There's a lot of people who talk trash on the field but can't back it up. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=584.92s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson says the game isn't even close to over. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=588.76s)]
*  It's just getting started. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  There was a story 10 days ago that said this is the worst April for the stock market since [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=595.4799999999999s)]

*  In Colorado Springs this weekend, an MS-13 nightclub got iced. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=623.04s)]
*  Over 100 illegal gangsters were arrested with their girlfriends. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=627.88s)]
*  Hope their wives weren't watching. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=631.84s)]
*  Think about how brazen these migrants were. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=634.04s)]
*  They had their own nightclub in the middle of Colorado and Biden knew about it and let [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=636.52s)]
*  it thrive. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=640.8s)]
*  During the Biden administration, they received 170 911 calls to that club alone. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=642.48s)]
*  That club we were just watching, 170 calls. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=648.72s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that would have been a red flag? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=651.44s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=654.36s)]
*  Guns, shootings, ag batteries, nothing happened. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=655.36s)]
*  So under Donald Trump, DEA, FBI, US Marshals, ATF, ICE, everyone went in together. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=658.4s)]
*  DEA led this investigation, went in, got 115 illegal immigrants, aliens in our country, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=665.84s)]

*  Over this past weekend, it was announced that through Operation Tidal Wave, a joint effort [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=689.84s)]
*  between ICE Miami and Florida law enforcement agencies, nearly 800 illegal aliens were arrested [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=694.2s)]

*  But some of these bad hombres aren't too slick. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=702.96s)]
*  One illegal got busted for stealing three grand in cash from Kristi Noem's purse at [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=705.5600000000001s)]

*  The feds found him, passed out, blowing his hall on cocktails in an Italian restaurant. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=716.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of cash for Kristi Noem to be carrying around in her purse. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=722.44s)]
*  Maybe the Easter Bunny left it for her. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  So whenever I ask my wife if she has any cash, any cash, she never does. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=727.08s)]
*  Trump planted 100 illegal alien mugshots right on the White House lawn. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=732.4000000000001s)]
*  So every time a reporter does a live shot from their position outside the White House, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=738.12s)]
*  the mugshots are in the background and there's nothing they can do about it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=742.0400000000001s)]
*  He's forcing the media to cover the crime wave they just covered up. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=746.6s)]
*  And these are the worst of the worst. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=750.96s)]
*  Illegals convicted of murder to child rape. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=753.12s)]
*  The media wanted to see Trump's mugshot and he was like, take these instead. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=757.2s)]
*  And the press is flabbergasted at how they keep getting outfoxed. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  The White House has put up about 100 posters of what they say are unauthorized immigrants [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=766.52s)]
*  who have been arrested for violent crimes. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=772.84s)]
*  You can see them there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=774.88s)]
*  They put them up on the driveway of the White House. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=775.88s)]
*  But what's particularly noteworthy about this location is it is right directly behind [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=778.84s)]
*  the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=783.44s)]
*  So therefore, no matter what network you're on, that includes MSNBC, if you're doing a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  hit from the White House right now, those pictures will be behind you. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=794.4s)]
*  I would encourage those individuals that have that as a back shot to blur those people out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  I would encourage, I recognize live shots are tough, but I would encourage folks to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=804.08s)]
*  actually make sure that those shots are blurred to the best of your abilities. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=807.56s)]
*  We know better. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  Well said. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  MSNBC is demanding privacy for illegal aliens who rape kids. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  They have to protect the privacy rights of Honduran nationals convicted of murder. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  In this industry, we only blur faces of minors and they want to blur faces of illegals who [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  rape minors. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=828.76s)]
*  They're coddling foreign third world criminals like children. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=830.64s)]
*  And MS-13 needs protection from us. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=834.12s)]
*  America's Heart Throb says everyone's getting deported, whether they like it or not. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=838.12s)]
*  What percentage of the, let's just pick an even number of say, 10 million illegal aliens. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=843.12s)]
*  Let's say that Biden released. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=850.4s)]
*  What percentage do you think we should let stay here of those 10 million? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=851.4s)]
*  I'm not trying to do a game. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=854.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=855.4s)]
*  No, no, but you think that's the best use of. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=856.4s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=857.96s)]
*  Is it your view that if a Democrat president releases 10, 15, 20 million illegals into [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=859.1600000000001s)]

*  I'm asking what the Republican president. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=870.36s)]
*  Yeah, so OK, so you don't want to answer the question because you know the answer is obvious. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=871.88s)]
*  Everyone that Biden let in has to go home. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=876.8000000000001s)]
*  Tom Homan's going to be a busy man. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=878.64s)]
*  In fact, he says he's going to do a third term too. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=881.0400000000001s)]

*  People want to know, OK, when am I going to retire for the third time? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=887.98s)]

*  They're ordering planes full of illegals to turn around mid-flight and fly back to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=902.3000000000001s)]

*  He knows a thing or two about evidence. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=924.22s)]
*  And another was caught aiding and abetting a migrant escaping justice. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=926.9s)]

*  the proceeding and helped the illegal sneak out the back door. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=938.98s)]
*  This judge swore an oath to the Constitution to faithfully administer the law, and she's [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=943.02s)]

*  So the Justice Department said, no one's above the law, and arrested the judge. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  They told us that's what happens. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=957.22s)]
*  They told us no matter who you were, no matter what you do, no one's above the law. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=959.5s)]
*  You break the law, you pay the price. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  Now the same people who told you that said judges should be above the law and should [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=966.54s)]

*  A king doesn't have a constitution. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=982.0999999999999s)]
*  A king just does whatever he wants. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=984.14s)]
*  This is a constitutional crisis. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=985.78s)]
*  Arresting a judge today, are you kidding me? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=988.3s)]
*  That is a sign of weakness, not strength. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  It strikes me as maybe something illegal, but it also strikes me as something heroic. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=994.28s)]
*  People are sometimes called to do civil disobedience. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=999.16s)]
*  They're saying you can break the law to resist Trump. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1003.0s)]
*  Not just you, judges, the military, politicians. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1005.76s)]

*  This is why they don't care when psychos go to Ukraine and show up with a rifle at Trump's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1014.0s)]

*  Democrats obsessed with getting revenge, overturning the results of the last election. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1425.28s)]
*  The Democrats, they have their first 100-day verdict, and that's in, and it is a disaster. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1430.16s)]
*  Multiple polls now have them in the 20s. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1436.96s)]
*  The country has witnessed nothing but a bunch of petulant children embracing irrational [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  anger, extreme radicalism, with pointless sit-ins, chanting and singing and dropping [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  F-bomb after F-bomb after F-bomb. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1449.6000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they're bingo paddles and their inability to stand for mothers that [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1452.1s)]
*  lost children or a young man that beat cancer. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1455.98s)]
*  And perhaps no one in the entire country has been more obsessed with getting Trump than [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1459.1799999999998s)]
*  the congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1463.26s)]
*  But recently, after a short stint in his own state, he went to Target. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1466.4199999999998s)]
*  Somebody robbed his car. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1470.86s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1472.02s)]
*  Even Schiff seemed to realize that his party has gone completely off the rails. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1473.34s)]
*  Nice of him to finally go to a Target. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1478.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1480.26s)]
*  I went to this Target in South San Francisco, 10 o'clock at night, and I'm getting the toiletries [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1481.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to need for my next two days in the city. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1489.3s)]
*  I had to get the clerk, which is hard to find, to unlock the shampoo or whatever. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1491.78s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1498.6s)]
*  And then I get to the cashier. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1499.6s)]
*  The cashier asked me if I want one of those Target bags with a little bullseye on it. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1500.6s)]
*  And I said, yes, that Target bag is going to be my luggage for the next two days. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1505.74s)]
*  And she asked me what happened, and I told her and basically said, in not so many words, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1510.02s)]
*  yeah, Democrats are a*****. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1514.74s)]
*  And I thought, you know, if the cashier in South San Francisco at 10 o'clock at night [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1517.74s)]
*  believes that Democrats are a***** because the shampoo was locked up and my stuff got [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1522.1s)]
*  stolen out of the trunk, we've got a major problem. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1528.04s)]
*  He's a senator from the state. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1532.54s)]
*  How could he not know all that was going on in his state? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1534.5s)]
*  And I have bad news for my friends in California. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1538.14s)]
*  Nothing's going to get better with the likes of Adam Schiff, radical Gavin Newsom, or any [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  other Democrat in charge of that state. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1546.1000000000001s)]
*  Their policies, their beliefs are insane. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1548.0200000000002s)]
*  And as we speak tonight, with few exceptions, there are really only two types of Democrats. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1550.42s)]
*  Far left losers obsessed with hating Donald Trump and are petrified of their ultra radical [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1556.18s)]
*  woke base and that ultra radical base led by the squad AOC, Grandpa Bernie, Jasmine [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1561.18s)]
*  Crockett. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  Their bizarre focus is on Green New Deal communism, the so-called fight the oligarchy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1568.9s)]
*  Now there's a civil war brewing between the radical and the super radical sides of the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party, but there's no moderates left. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1579.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1582.26s)]
*  Let me ask you about something that your colleague, Senator Alyssa Slotkin said. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1583.68s)]
*  She said Democrats should stop using the term oligarchy because it's a phrase that doesn't [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1587.2s)]
*  resonate with all Americans. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1592.0s)]
*  Are you missing a chance to speak to a wider audience, Senator? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1594.52s)]
*  Well jeez, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1600.4s)]
*  We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1608.72s)]
*  I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1614.3799999999999s)]
*  President Trump has totally broken the Democratic Party in a hundred days and as of now there [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1622.1s)]
*  is no one capable of picking up the pieces. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  So the White House Correspondents Dinner was on Saturday and it might have been the most [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1629.3999999999999s)]
*  low energy event since Joe Biden challenged Mitch McConnell to a game of freeze tag. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1633.54s)]
*  It was there reporters gave themselves awards, including one for writing about Biden's decline [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1640.34s)]
*  in office. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1644.86s)]
*  A story they didn't so much cover as hide under a pee stained tarp. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1645.86s)]
*  Seriously, the media handing themselves an award for covering Joe's decay is like giving [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1650.22s)]
*  BLM an award for fighting crime. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1654.86s)]
*  Alex Thompson won an award because he also wrote a book about Biden's brain drain. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1658.26s)]
*  But like betting on a horse after the race is over, the book magically appeared long [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1663.3799999999999s)]
*  after Biden left office. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1667.58s)]
*  It's like running into a burning building after it's been rebuilt as a Starbucks. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1669.94s)]
*  Everyone knew Biden was long gone. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1675.06s)]
*  I mean, it's not often you see a podium with a seatbelt on it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1677.1000000000001s)]
*  So sorry, Alex, you get no points for admitting what your entire industry has had no choice, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1681.14s)]
*  but to admit they didn't just fail to report on the problem. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1688.3400000000001s)]
*  They were the problem. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1691.96s)]
*  Here he is accepting the award. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1693.6200000000001s)]
*  Biden's decline and its cover up by the people around him is a reminder that every White [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1696.04s)]
*  House, regardless of party, is capable of deception. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1703.24s)]
*  But being truth tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1709.72s)]
*  We, myself included, missed a lot of this story and some people trust us less because [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1713.68s)]
*  of it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1721.36s)]
*  We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1723.4s)]
*  Oh, we missed, missed a lot of the story. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1729.5600000000002s)]
*  That suggests it like wasn't intentional. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1735.8000000000002s)]
*  Like missing a bus because you couldn't leave the orphanage until we found Timmy's cat. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1738.88s)]
*  But when someone or maybe 60 million someones are telling you that the bus is right there [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1744.88s)]
*  in front of you and it's waiting for you and you still don't get on, that's intentional. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1749.12s)]
*  If only they could blame Trump because you know that's what that whole room was thinking [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1754.8s)]
*  behind their flutes of cheap champagne. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1759.08s)]
*  You know they still felt that Trump's candidacy justified anything they did or didn't do and [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1761.12s)]
*  they do it all over again. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1766.76s)]
*  You can't teach an old dog new tricks, though Joy Behar will respond to getting whacked [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1768.48s)]
*  with a rolled up newspaper. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1773.1s)]
*  You were waiting. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1774.1s)]
*  You were so patiently waiting. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1775.1s)]
*  Now it's kind of nice someone in legacy media admitted their complete and total incompetence, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1776.1s)]
*  but do they really think that's all it'll take to build trust? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1785.02s)]
*  That we all have faith in them now? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1788.4599999999998s)]
*  It's like John Wayne Gacy going, yeah, they found a few dead kids under my house, but [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1790.2199999999998s)]
*  I'm a different guy now. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1795.1399999999999s)]
*  What time's your kid's birthday party again? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's rewatch this clip again, but focus on the unimpressed fella in the audience. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1801.38s)]
*  We, myself included, missed a lot of this story and some people trust us less because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1806.7800000000002s)]
*  of it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1813.6200000000001s)]
*  We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such days. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1815.68s)]
*  That's our executive producer, Tom O'Connor of our show. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1823.22s)]
*  Now forget the fact that he was supposed to be waxing my car that day. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1828.34s)]
*  But notice his Tom face when Alex says, we bear some responsibility for trust in the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1833.8999999999999s)]
*  media being at such lows. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  You see that? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1840.1399999999999s)]
*  That is, his eyebrow says it all. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1842.62s)]
*  What's with this wee b****? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1844.8999999999999s)]
*  We? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1847.8999999999999s)]
*  We screwed up? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1848.8999999999999s)]
*  Not us, you jackass. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1849.8999999999999s)]
*  Our show reported on Joe's decline every damn day. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1854.9s)]
*  It came right after our Bay Har Fat Joe, which you already got and you're welcome. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1862.02s)]
*  But if his eyebrow inched any higher, it would have landed on the back of his neck. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1869.46s)]
*  So don't include us in this phony apology tour. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1873.3400000000001s)]
*  There was at least one table in that room that had nothing to apologize for. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1876.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, unless it's for the missing silverware, you know how the deuces get. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1881.26s)]
*  But after that, the head of the Correspondence Association spoke. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1885.98s)]
*  We care deeply about accuracy and take seriously the heavy responsibility of being stewards [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1890.66s)]
*  of the public's trust. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1895.94s)]
*  What we are not is the opposition. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1898.18s)]
*  What we are not is the enemy of the people and what we are not is the enemy of the state. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1901.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1906.94s)]
*  There are not too many professions where you have to clarify that you're not the enemy [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1908.28s)]
*  of the people, especially by a guy who looks like he ate Lionel Richie. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1911.92s)]
*  But how does he prove he's not the enemy? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1919.92s)]
*  Well, let's try this out. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1921.8s)]
*  Did you tell us the truth or did you lie for the last four years, primarily about COVID, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1923.04s)]
*  Biden, race, crime, the border? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1928.72s)]
*  And you're not the enemy of the people when you lie like that. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1931.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't have an ass harder than the dinner rolls at Bennigan's. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1934.92s)]
*  So look, it's easy to make fun of this sad affair, but it's their pretension, arrogance [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1940.52s)]
*  and entitlement that makes it so easy. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=1944.8s)]

*  I'll say this. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2206.0s)]

*  I'm sitting right here actually. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2214.96s)]
*  Every award that was given out had to do with something covering Biden. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2216.88s)]

*  podium after he signed the billion, billion, billion dollars worth of aid to Ukraine. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2227.48s)]
*  That was the photo of the year? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2234.08s)]
*  Not the bullet whizzing through the head or the fight photograph of President Trump. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2235.92s)]
*  Every story, every coverage that they gave themselves awards for had to do with President [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2241.68s)]
*  Biden and to sit there during that particular speech where it's like watching someone or [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2249.7599999999998s)]
*  hearing someone see the light halfway dim, halfway past, it was unconscionable to sit [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2254.68s)]
*  there and have everyone ignore the beast, the elephant in the room, which was Fox, to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2262.52s)]
*  your point that we've been saying it the whole time. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2267.0s)]
*  They should have acknowledged that that dude should have said except for Fox. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2268.56s)]
*  He should have. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2272.32s)]
*  And the purposeful ignoring of the sitting commander in chief of all of the, it was so [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2273.8s)]
*  blatant, guys, it was pretty insane. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2280.24s)]
*  And then at the end, this is what I found the most humorous, is that they were like, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2282.44s)]
*  and this year we have 20 million outlets representing this, 15 podcasts, 37, they named all the [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2286.52s)]
*  variety and the diversity of actual types of media coverage that were represented there. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2294.56s)]
*  But yet the same four big bloated liberal media outlets presented the whole time and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2300.0s)]
*  got the awards. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2305.48s)]
*  So they're patting themselves on the back for all of a sudden representing universality. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2306.48s)]
*  But the joke was on us because all they did was just applaud themselves and pat themselves [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2310.28s)]
*  on the back. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmRgai_Ug0&t=2314.28s)]
