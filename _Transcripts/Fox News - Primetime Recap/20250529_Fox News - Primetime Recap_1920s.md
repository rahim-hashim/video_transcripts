# Fox News Highlights - May 28th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE)
*  The hate, they live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=2.5s)]
*  Now what happens when you're a Christian [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=6.7s)]
*  espousing traditional Christian views on human sexuality [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=9.32s)]
*  and you hold a rally in Seattle? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=13.52s)]
*  But a time of blessing and praise [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=16.12s)]
*  quickly devolved into chaos. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=18.36s)]
*  Far left activists and Antifa militants [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=20.52s)]
*  tried to disrupt the concert. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=27.36s)]
*  Fighting absolutely insane. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=30.0s)]
*  Throwing water balloons at the crowd, menacing attendees, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=33.68s)]
*  and some activists even tried rushing the stage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=37.04s)]
*  But there was more chaos yesterday [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=41.44s)]
*  when a Christian group held a peaceful rally [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=43.36s)]
*  under the hashtag, don't mess with our kids. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=45.56s)]
*  And they were attacked by violent Antifa radicals. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=48.6s)]
*  What is the purpose of the Bible? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=52.0s)]
*  We're crazy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=54.6s)]
*  You hold the scene. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=55.44s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=56.68s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=58.36s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=59.2s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=60.04s)]
*  Move back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=60.88s)]
*  Move back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=61.72s)]
*  Move. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=62.56s)]
*  Police were called in, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=64.12s)]
*  but the thugs wearing masks felt entitled. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=65.12s)]
*  They felt entitled to harass the families [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  who were trying to get into the event. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=70.2s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=73.4s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=74.48s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=75.72s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=76.72s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=77.56s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=78.4s)]
*  They got a home. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=79.24000000000001s)]

*  You pay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=92.7s)]
*  You pay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=93.52s)]
*  Now just a few days earlier, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=94.36s)]
*  Mayor Bruce Harrell's office in Seattle [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=95.2s)]
*  had a few defended the free speech rights of that group. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=96.64s)]
*  No, not of the Christians. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=100.28s)]
*  He referred to the gathering of Christians [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=101.44s)]
*  as a far right rally and a right wing national effort [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=104.0s)]
*  designed to provoke a reaction inherently opposed to his city's values, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=108.02s)]
*  which of course are very LGBTQ plus friendly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  He claimed he was committed to justice and to fairness, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=115.94s)]
*  but instead of instilling calm, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=119.22s)]
*  this guy's words tacitly greenlit the violence that would end up occurring. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=121.46s)]
*  And as I said over the weekend, the pastor who spoke at the first rally, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=126.58s)]
*  well, he had demanded an apology. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=130.38s)]
*  Bruce Harrell, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=132.82s)]
*  the mayor of Seattle owes Christians in Washington state and apology for his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=133.7s)]
*  bigoted remarks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=139.78s)]
*  After folks who were holding a peaceful worship event were violently assaulted, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  police officers were hospitalized. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  Church people were assaulted and the mayor of Seattle has the audacity to blame [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=150.5s)]
*  Christians for the violence. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=157.54s)]
*  Nothing could be more demonic and untrue. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=160.22s)]
*  Well, the FBI has announced that it's doing an investigation. Thank goodness. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=163.3s)]
*  Go Dan Bongino. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's about time, isn't it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  That these violent thugs feel the consequences of their actions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=171.46s)]
*  There are potential civil rights violations here. 18 USC section 241. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  And these types of threats, intimidation, acts of physical violence, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=181.9s)]
*  if they're allowed to continue without severe punishment, well, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  what can we expect? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=188.86s)]
*  We can expect that things are going to get worse, not get better. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  Now for years, the left beat the drum that Trump was a threat to democracy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=194.54s)]
*  We still hear that. They call him a dictator. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=198.46s)]
*  Sometimes they've even called him Hitler. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=200.98s)]
*  And we had two assassination attempts in the span of a few months. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=203.3s)]
*  The groundwork laid for all this violence though. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=207.7s)]
*  It was years in the making and all by Democrats. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=210.58s)]
*  Go to the Hill today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=219.78s)]
*  Get up and please get up in the face of some Congress people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=224.62s)]
*  There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=229.7s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=232.66s)]
*  Senators threaten Supreme court justices. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=234.18s)]
*  I want to tell you for such, I want to tell you, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=236.98s)]
*  Kevin or you have released the whirlwind and you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=240.34s)]
*  will pay the price. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=245.02s)]
*  You won't know what hit you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=250.46s)]
*  If you go forward with these awful decisions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=252.26s)]
*  And their new stars, they're openly calling it warfare. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=256.18s)]
*  Hey, God damn it. Shut down the Senate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=260.26s)]
*  Now wonder the far left feels like it can get away with targeting Jews on campus [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=268.38s)]
*  or Christians in a public park because for them committing acts of violence or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=272.78s)]
*  intimidation or harassment, it's become a civic duty. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=277.97999999999996s)]
*  They're just carrying out their marching orders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  This is what the modern day Democrat Party has spawned and these Democrats, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  they were real on about Charlottesville and claim that January 6th disqualified [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=290.05999999999995s)]
*  Trump from office. Nice try. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=293.9s)]
*  The voters saw right through that and they see what you're doing and they're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  rejecting it because we have a constitution because Trump's in office. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=299.73999999999995s)]
*  These coordinated campaigns of violence and intimidation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=304.14s)]
*  They're not going to be swept under the rug. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=307.42s)]
*  And in other countries, unfortunately, it's easy to do this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=309.74s)]
*  Remember what we've seen in places like China where churches have been [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=314.18s)]
*  demolished, worshipers harassed and even jailed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=317.66s)]
*  The suffering of Syrian Christians post Assad, well documented in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=322.06s)]
*  Iraq, according to our own State Department, the number of Christians has gone from [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=327.14000000000004s)]
*  one point one million in 2011 to only about one hundred and twenty thousand as [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=330.94s)]
*  of last year. They've been slaughtered or driven out by Islamic militants. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=336.14s)]
*  In the Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, the faithful are asking [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=341.86s)]
*  whether it's the end of the line for them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=344.78s)]
*  But most Western elites, they're blissfully unconcerned by this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  The truth is, most liberals like the Seattle mayor view traditional Christianity [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  as repressive and extremist. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=358.18s)]
*  Because if you have a biblical worldview of gender and sexuality, odds are that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=361.3s)]
*  you're going to be labeled as haters and anti LGBTQ plus fanatics. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=366.34s)]
*  And we've seen Christians are routinely derided by well-known television [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=371.5s)]
*  personalities. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=375.82s)]
*  One thing to talk to Jesus. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  It's another thing when Jesus talks to you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=379.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=381.54s)]
*  OK, well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=382.22s)]

*  I mean. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=383.94000000000005s)]
*  That's different. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=384.62s)]
*  That's called mental illness, if I'm not correct. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  Christianity has long been used to justify the oppression of others. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=388.98s)]
*  It was used to justify slavery. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=393.18s)]
*  It was used to justify Jim Crow. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=394.86s)]
*  It's dangerous because it's a radically anti-democratic ideology. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=396.74s)]
*  Now, these people loathe middle America and they loathe middle America's faith. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=401.22s)]
*  Why are white rural voters a threat to democracy? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=406.5s)]
*  They're the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=409.66s)]
*  geodemographic group in the country. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=413.9s)]
*  They're also the most strongly white nationalist and white Christian nationalist. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=415.54s)]
*  Now, who doubts that if they thought they could deny Christians a platform to speak [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=420.86s)]
*  that they would. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=426.9s)]
*  Or if they could ban traditional churches, certain churches and certain church [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=428.62s)]
*  teachings, who doubts that they would? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=432.86s)]
*  They're extremist groups. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=436.06s)]
*  They want attention, according to Mayor Harrell's spokesperson, Callie Craighead. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=437.74s)]
*  And they're further publishing their event would assist their goal, she said. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=443.02s)]
*  Well, here are the facts. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=448.14s)]
*  If you're a Christian and you believe in traditional values, the left and its [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=449.7s)]
*  supporters see you as an enemy and they're going to do everything possible if they [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=454.42s)]
*  can to wreck your career, hinder your ability to speak, brainwash your kids, and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=459.98s)]
*  even get in your face and assault you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=465.82s)]
*  And with their own incendiary rhetoric, Democrats have fueled the intimidation [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=468.78s)]
*  campaigns. But don't they see how desperate and weak this makes them look? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=472.74s)]
*  And this is why so many Christians support Donald Trump. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  They simply do not trust Democrats to protect their religious liberty. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=483.26s)]
*  And who can blame them? And that's the end. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=487.74s)]
*  Kamala went down under to Australia. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=490.06s)]
*  She brought Dougie not so fresh. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=493.18s)]
*  It was a romantic weekend getaway. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=494.70000000000005s)]
*  Walks by the water in the park. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=496.98s)]
*  Doug leaned in. Never lean in, Dougie. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=499.5s)]
*  How many times do we have to say it? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  So what was Kamala doing halfway across the world? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=505.06s)]
*  Well, she was a surprise guest at a real estate conference. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=508.06s)]
*  You're probably asking, what does Kamala know about real estate? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=512.1s)]
*  No idea. The real estate agents at the conference said Kamala lost focus. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=515.9s)]
*  It was so bad, the conference didn't even post a video of her interview, even [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=521.5s)]
*  though they posted everybody else's. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=525.7s)]
*  What were they trying to hide? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=528.62s)]
*  Well, we found out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=530.58s)]
*  We got our hands on the tape and she hasn't changed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=531.9s)]
*  I have a lived experience that has taught me something I talk about all the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=536.78s)]
*  time, which is my lived experience that tells me that the vast majority of us [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=541.78s)]
*  have so much more in common than what separates us. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=547.86s)]
*  And I consider it a blessing and a privilege to have that lived experience [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=552.5s)]
*  in a way that it gives me a true sense of understanding of what is possible when [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=557.38s)]
*  we think of building communities. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=563.1400000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris sounds like she's doing an impression of Kamala Harris. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=565.86s)]
*  And she's still unburdened. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=570.22s)]
*  Who fight for freedom. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  They see what can be and they're unburdened by what has been. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=574.74s)]
*  They believe in what is possible. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=580.22s)]
*  And so even though it may be characterized as a fight, it really is, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=582.58s)]
*  it should, I think we thought of in the context of a fight for something as [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  opposed to against something. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=592.38s)]
*  Kamala hasn't learned a thing, but she swears Barack Obama taught her history. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  And now she calls herself a student of history. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=600.82s)]
*  I think one of the very special aspects of the school is he really is a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  student of history. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=611.34s)]
*  It's critically important because coupled with the enthusiasm that comes [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=613.5s)]
*  with ambition and optimism must be the clear eye focus of understanding where [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=619.86s)]
*  we've been. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=627.22s)]
*  And being a student of history is, I think, one of the best ways to then [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=627.98s)]
*  contextualize the importance and the relevance of what we are doing today. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=634.22s)]
*  Remember when Kamala was really into space? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=641.9s)]
*  Now she's into history. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=644.78s)]
*  And like most Democrats, she only knows about World War II. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=646.94s)]
*  So she flew all the way to Australia to teach them about Hitler. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  It's important. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=654.86s)]
*  It's important we remember the 1930s. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  It's important that we remember that history has taught us that isolation [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=659.66s)]
*  does not equal insulation. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=665.78s)]
*  It is important that we understand and remember history, which taught us the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=669.54s)]
*  interdependence and interconnection between nations, the importance of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=674.7s)]
*  friendships, integrity, honesty. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=679.42s)]
*  There's so much about foreign affairs that is just like the importance of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=687.86s)]
*  having good friendships. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=695.54s)]
*  What's Kamala doing? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=697.66s)]
*  Well, she says she's unemployed, but she's looking for a job. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=699.14s)]
*  Australia regrettably regretted the invitation. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=704.62s)]
*  The audience didn't think she was super engaging. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=709.2600000000001s)]
*  Democrats here at home say don't call her boring. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=712.46s)]
*  She likes memes. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=715.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris, for whatever you say about her, did connect with people culturally. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=717.34s)]
*  There was the Brett summer. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=722.0200000000001s)]
*  There were all these people putting up the coconut memes. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=723.82s)]
*  Behind the scenes, everyone knew the Harris campaign was a lemon. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  One donor told an Obama guy who joined the campaign, it'll be political suicide. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=730.34s)]
*  You're going to be a loser. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=735.7s)]
*  Another told another Obama guy after Harris lost. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=737.66s)]
*  You're just an old broken down boy. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=740.86s)]
*  Remember Barry had his guy's runner campaign. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=744.14s)]
*  It backfired and he's getting the blame. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=747.02s)]
*  One DNC insider says the old Obama playbook no longer works. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=749.86s)]
*  Another Democrat says Barry has blood on his hands. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=754.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=757.98s)]
*  I don't want a surgeon who keeps killing the patients. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=758.82s)]
*  The Obamas are dodging bullets, just like it's the South side of Chicago. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=762.5s)]
*  First, Barack called black men sexist for not voting for Harris. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=766.58s)]
*  Now, Michelle's blaming the women. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=770.1800000000001s)]

*  It happened in this election. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=785.14s)]
*  Michelle thinks women only voted for Trump because their husbands did. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=787.58s)]
*  Is she saying women just do what they're told because Barack can't tell her what [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=792.26s)]
*  to do if he could, she wouldn't be doing a podcast. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=796.46s)]

*  I went on a left leaning podcast that children made nameless. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=922.38s)]

*  I kid. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1663.1s)]
*  Um, I thought, I thought it was so interesting about what you said. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1664.6599999999999s)]
*  The thing to me that I think the Democrats are going through is that whiplash [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1666.6599999999999s)]
*  because they're, it's, it's not just power. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1670.26s)]
*  It's the control from which their power was derived and they had no tighter [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1672.6999999999998s)]
*  control over all of us than during COVID. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1677.06s)]
*  So I think after the lockdowns, when, when we look back on that, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1679.26s)]
*  I think it's difficult to put into words how history will portray it. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1684.14s)]
*  But I mean, the amount of control pastors couldn't preach pastors were [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1687.38s)]
*  arrested for, for giving sermons outside. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1692.38s)]
*  We saw bars that were criminally prosecuted for continuing their, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1695.5800000000002s)]
*  their liquor licenses taken away. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1698.7s)]
*  Like it was such a, a perversion of the administrative state and the regulatory [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1699.98s)]
*  state with the criminalization of people all over. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1704.38s)]
*  And nothing that they did prevented deaths. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1708.3400000000001s)]
*  In fact, it, it furthered it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1710.46s)]
*  And then right after that, I think that the Democrats, the last thing they [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1711.8200000000002s)]
*  expected was for people to rest back control and rest back that power because [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1715.1000000000001s)]
*  they thought they had it in the bag. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1720.18s)]
*  Well, they're going to entrust everything to us. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1721.5s)]
*  Of course they'll entrust their children's biology and the border and the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1723.22s)]
*  like, but at the end of the day, that fallacy of the choice of true evil [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1727.14s)]
*  versus a coma or the undemocratic, the threat to democracy versus what they [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1732.18s)]
*  did, which was obliterate democracy. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1736.5s)]
*  They did do a coup. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1738.98s)]
*  So I see right now we're opening it up and we're seeing this, this abscess [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1740.18s)]
*  and what pusses in the wound. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1744.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1746.62s)]
*  Those subpoenas, that's the next step. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1747.02s)]
*  The testifying is the next step. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1749.18s)]
*  And then their criminal prosecution is that final step because there's [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1751.22s)]
*  a sentence in the master. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1754.9s)]
*  Welcome back tires. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1759.7s)]

*  Care to comment on this topic that we have so delved into for the [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1766.98s)]
*  past 15 or so minutes. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1770.3s)]
*  No, I'm still shook about the whole Rashid lying thing. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1772.9s)]
*  I need to, I think it's, I think it's you look at history when [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1775.22s)]
*  stuff like this happens. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1780.58s)]
*  And since they like to use the term Hitler so often, we can remember [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1781.7s)]
*  that when the various generals and people that were a part of that evil [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1786.3s)]
*  empire were brought to justice, they often tried to say, well, we were [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1791.34s)]
*  under the impression that the Jewish people were an existential threat. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1795.26s)]
*  So it's really not our fault. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1799.34s)]
*  What we did, because we were just following orders, trying to protect. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1800.7s)]
*  There's no difference in this and nothing should ever be compared to [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1803.98s)]
*  what happened to the Jewish people under the Hitler regime, but because [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1808.82s)]
*  they keep bringing it in our place is the only reason why I'm using it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1812.1s)]
*  Because it goes back to this. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1815.18s)]
*  We still had people who lost their lives under this so-called group of normal [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1816.74s)]
*  people, like you have to keep bringing up Afghanistan, you have to keep bringing [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1821.34s)]
*  up, not having secret service members to guard a president who somebody's [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1824.46s)]
*  running for president. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1828.3s)]
*  There is thousands of the border patrol agents. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1829.22s)]
*  We look at all the things, dude, this wasn't normal people. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1831.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1834.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1834.46s)]
*  That's not a normal American. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1834.6200000000001s)]
*  A normal American would be like, he's not right. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1835.78s)]
*  It's my duty as an American to report to the American people that this [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1838.5s)]
*  president's not fit to serve. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1841.66s)]
*  That's what a normal American does. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1842.8600000000001s)]
*  What these extreme progressive did was this was their opportunity to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1845.14s)]
*  take over this government because they cannot get elected by themselves. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1849.1000000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders does not have enough to cross the threshold. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1851.94s)]
*  So this little group of people, and you look at the people, unelected people [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1855.14s)]
*  making decisions on someone who was completely unfit to serve. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1858.78s)]
*  The problem is it should have been done while they're in the act and this [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1862.18s)]
*  would have been stopped. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1865.3s)]
*  So now they're getting into their little books and they're trying to soften the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1866.06s)]
*  water by saying, well, I only did it because, you know, Donald Trump's an [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1869.1s)]
*  existentialist. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1872.54s)]
*  That's a feeling. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1873.22s)]
*  It's not a fact. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1874.5s)]
*  He's we've had two, it feels like six terms he's been under, but we've had one [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1875.74s)]
*  term and this new term and he has yet to do anything that they have accused him [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1879.42s)]
*  of. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1883.6200000000001s)]
*  Not even close to it, the exact opposite, but we still reverberate that garbage of [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1884.22s)]
*  saying, well, it's Trump derangement. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1889.02s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1891.0600000000002s)]
*  It was Trump opportunity. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1891.5800000000002s)]
*  These are not, he has a PhD. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1893.42s)]
*  He's not stupid. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1895.26s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1896.42s)]
*  They chose to do it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1897.7s)]
*  They did it on our watch and now they're trying to make it to where they, well, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1898.7s)]
*  it's still Trump. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1902.18s)]
*  It's still Trump because Trump derangement still holds water with what? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1902.78s)]
*  The propaganda media. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1905.6200000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_f0jmrrrAE&t=1907.26s)]
