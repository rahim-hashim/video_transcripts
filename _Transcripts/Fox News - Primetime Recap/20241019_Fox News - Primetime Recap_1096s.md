# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 18, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw)
*  So the elites are sweating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=0.0s)]
*  And when I say sweating, I mean really sweating. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=2.0s)]
*  And that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=5.0s)]
*  Now, of course, as expected, the media is in full-on propaganda mode 24-7. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=10.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, they all got the Trump's enemies list memo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=15.0s)]
*  Do they not understand that our freedom is on the line? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=21.0s)]
*  You do understand that he will turn on this country and he will turn us into Hungary. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=24.0s)]
*  It will continue by putting his enemies in jail. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=31.0s)]
*  He'll turn us into Hungary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=34.0s)]
*  Do these people ever listen to themselves? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=36.0s)]
*  Literally, it's the Biden DOJ and Biden-approved liberal judges in Obama's too, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=39.0s)]
*  who have been working overtime even now to put their political nemesis, Donald Trump, in jail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=46.0s)]
*  Even making public new evidence today in the Jack Smith case in the last month of a presidential election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=52.0s)]
*  Now, Chutkin is a complete embarrassment, who has long-standing judicial norms about publicizing cases in an election cycle. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=60.0s)]
*  But just as the media has lost its credibility, so too have those engaging in lawfare against Donald Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=68.0s)]
*  So, NBC was surprised this week when it conducted a panel of Lebanese-American voters. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=76.0s)]
*  Who's voting for Kamala Harris here? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=83.0s)]
*  Absolutely no. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=87.0s)]
*  No. Not possible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=88.0s)]
*  There's nothing she can do or say for us to change our mind. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=90.0s)]
*  Why are you voting for Donald Trump? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=94.0s)]
*  Because my main goal is to get someone who is actively funding a genocide out of office. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=95.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=102.0s)]
*  And when the Harris campaign is confronted with the facts about Harris' loss of support among blacks and Latinos, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=103.0s)]
*  well, they just change the subject. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=110.0s)]
*  There are a number of key groups in the Democratic coalition who are not supporting Kamala Harris in the same numbers that they did for Joe Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=113.0s)]
*  Where do you think you can make up for what we're seeing in the deficits in the polls? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=122.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, Dana, no election is exactly like the one previous, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=128.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is facing historic gender gap with women. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=133.0s)]
*  And if you look at young women, he may end up losing them by 40, 45 points. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, but the black male discontent with Democrats is real. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=142.0s)]
*  20%, according to the New York Times poll, will vote for Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=146.0s)]
*  That is a big jump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, it's significant to have people like Jim Clyburn worried. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=151.0s)]
*  And he is. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=156.0s)]
*  So Democrats do know they're in trouble here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=158.0s)]
*  And beyond Kamala's new weed and loan giveaways proposal, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=160.0s)]
*  their plan to get black men back in the fold relies on appearances by some black celebs like Lizzo and Usher. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=165.0s)]
*  And of course, the biggest celeb of all and the most well-known elite of them all, Barack Obama. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=174.0s)]
*  Because his scolding of black men as sexist worked so well last week, they're sending him out again. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=181.0s)]
*  And by the way, Michelle's going to join this time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=186.0s)]
*  That's going to happen next week as part of Harris's closing argument. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=189.0s)]
*  Now, does he seem thrilled about the assignment to you? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=193.0s)]
*  You've got on one side somebody who really just cares about himself. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=196.0s)]
*  Everything's about him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=202.0s)]
*  2 a.m. tweets and tirades. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=203.0s)]
*  And Kamala is somebody who comes from modest beginnings, who had to fight for what she had. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=207.0s)]
*  And that's the kind of person that I'd want to vote for because I know push comes to shove. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=214.0s)]
*  She's going to be fighting for me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=219.0s)]
*  And that's the kind of president that we need. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=220.0s)]
*  Well, that was some unintentional truth telling right there because Kamala would fight for people like him, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=223.0s)]
*  for the elites whose biggest concern is whether they're going to vacation next summer on the French or Italian Riviera. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=229.0s)]
*  So they're sending Obama out there to help beat Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=237.0s)]
*  Think about that for a moment. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=241.0s)]
*  Obama is the reason we have Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=243.0s)]
*  Obama had a real chance to reform Washington, to bust up the Uniparty. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=246.0s)]
*  But instead, he just joined it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=251.0s)]
*  He and his wife came to D.C. on the promise that they'd stand up for the little people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=254.0s)]
*  But in the end, he became the face of the institutions that he pledged to reform. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=259.0s)]
*  Now, let's not forget, two years after he was sworn into office, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=265.0s)]
*  he lost the House of Representatives to the same type of people who are now supporting Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=268.0s)]
*  The Tea Party was born and it became an early indicator that things were turning against the globalists in both parties. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=274.0s)]
*  But Obama learned nothing from it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=281.0s)]
*  Instead, he lined up to support another elite, Hillary Clinton, and she also went down in flames. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=283.0s)]
*  But none of this affected Obama's ultimate payday, of course, because he and Michelle, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=290.0s)]
*  doesn't matter really what happened politically, they became rich, very rich, book deals, a Netflix deal, speaking gigs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=295.0s)]
*  So now they feel entitled to lecture black working class men who are struggling? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=302.0s)]
*  Stephen Smith has a few thoughts. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=308.0s)]
*  President Obama, what you said is not acceptable. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=311.0s)]
*  You're basically accusing black men who come up with a reason to not support Kamala Harris as engaging in misogyny. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=315.0s)]
*  When the mayor of New York was talking about $53 million in prepaid credit cards for immigrants who came across our borders illegally [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=326.0s)]
*  and having prepaid credit cards for them, and I said, wait a minute, black folks been starving for years, we ain't get that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=335.0s)]
*  You don't think they notice? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=341.0s)]
*  Is it possible that it's policy as opposed to misogyny? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=343.0s)]
*  Policy, yeah, that's the problem here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=350.0s)]
*  That's why people are turning against Kamala and maybe tuning out Barack Obama. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=353.0s)]
*  It's 100% correct. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=357.0s)]
*  But the media, the other media, they want you to believe that Trump is out of touch with minorities? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=358.0s)]
*  Well, it didn't look that way in the Bronx this week. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=364.0s)]
*  You guys are the same as me. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=367.0s)]
*  It's the same stuff. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=369.0s)]
*  We were born the same way. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=370.0s)]
*  I grew up in Queens and all of that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=372.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's I had a great father. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=375.0s)]
*  I had a father was a great guy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=377.0s)]
*  He was tough, but good. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=379.0s)]
*  Big heart, big, big heart. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=380.0s)]
*  And he was a construction guy pretty much and a real estate guy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=382.0s)]
*  And I learned a lot from him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=387.0s)]
*  He was great. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=389.0s)]
*  But I know you people so well without knowing you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=390.0s)]
*  I know you so well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=393.0s)]
*  When I walked in here, I said this is this is home territory. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=394.0s)]
*  Now, Trump's never been more popular than he is right now, despite everything that they've thrown at him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=399.0s)]
*  And the world has changed since President Obama came on the scene. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=407.0s)]
*  Back then, the Democrats could claim that they opposed Dick Cheney and all his wars. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=411.0s)]
*  Now they're the party of Dick Cheney. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=416.0s)]
*  Back then, they could claim that Cheney and other Republicans were the party of the rich. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=419.0s)]
*  Now, the Republicans are the ones campaigning in the barbershops while the Democrats are propped up by plutocrats. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=424.0s)]
*  Obama's still a talented spokesman. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=431.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=433.0s)]
*  But I think we all agree now that he speaks for the establishment, not the people. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=435.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=440.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and in only 18 days, you will elect a new president. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=441.0s)]
*  Make no mistake with early voting now underway all across the country. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=446.0s)]
*  And the next two and a half weeks are critical for both campaigns. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=450.0s)]
*  By the way, as a public service, I put on my website, Hannity.com. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=454.0s)]
*  If you want to look up your state, your Commonwealth, how to register when early voting starts and stops, you can look it up on the website. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=458.0s)]
*  And last night, a massive unforced error from the Harris campaign. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=466.0s)]
*  This has not been a good week for them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=471.0s)]
*  No presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984 has skipped out on the Al Smith dinner. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=473.0s)]
*  Now, it's a charitable event benefiting Catholic charities where candidates get to poke fun at each other. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=479.0s)]
*  But Kamala was nowhere to be found for a campaign supposedly built on joy, giggling, and a lot of fun. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=484.0s)]
*  It was kind of a weird move, especially since it's a very friendly room, usually New York City for Democrats, predominantly attended by liberals from New York City. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=493.0s)]
*  Kamala did send what was nothing but a short, cringeworthy, heavily produced, not funny edited video featuring a former SNL star that we won't force you to watch again. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=503.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, the dinner's host, comedian Jim Johnson, is here to help you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=515.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, the dinner's host, comedian Jim Gaffigan, I mean, he just roasted Kamala's absence and had some very interesting observations about the Democratic Party. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=520.0s)]
*  They were funny. Take a look. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=531.0s)]
*  This event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=533.0s)]
*  Twenty two percent of Americans identify as Catholic. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=539.0s)]
*  Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=544.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. Why is Vice President Harris not here? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=549.0s)]
*  This is a room full of Catholics and Jews in New York City. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=553.0s)]
*  This is a layup for the Democratic nominee. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=560.0s)]
*  I mean, in her defense, I mean, she did find time to appear on The View, Howard Stern, Colbert, and the longtime staple of campaigning, the Call Her Daddy podcast. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=565.0s)]
*  The Democrats have been telling us Trump, Trump's reelection is a threat to democracy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=580.0s)]
*  In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=587.0s)]
*  They ousted their democratically elected incumbent and installed Kamala Harris. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=593.0s)]
*  The media has begun discussing the phenomena of secret Trump voters. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=598.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard about this. People who publicly say they would never vote for Trump. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=604.0s)]
*  But then when they go in the voting booth, they do. It's a small group. They're called the Biden family. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=609.0s)]
*  That was a great line. Now, while Kamala was a no-show, many other prominent Democrats were in attendance, including Chuckie Schumer, Kathy Hochul, who wanted all conservatives to get on a bus to move to Florida. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=616.0s)]
*  OK, I took up your advice. Michael Bloomberg was there. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=628.0s)]
*  Even New York's Attorney General Letitia James was there after, of course, weaponizing New York's court system and justice system against Donald Trump. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=632.0s)]
*  And still, former President Trump was there, getting along pretty much with everybody. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=640.0s)]
*  He was hysterical. His jokes are going viral on social media. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=645.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=649.0s)]
*  Do something that's incredible that Catholic Church, you're helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=651.0s)]
*  But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=659.0s)]
*  And Minneapolis, and she would have been here guaranteed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=669.0s)]
*  I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=672.0s)]
*  I'd really hope that she would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=677.0s)]
*  She laughs like crazy. All polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should be. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=682.0s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. She hasn't. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=692.0s)]
*  She hasn't, instead of attending tonight. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=695.0s)]
*  She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=697.0s)]
*  But Catholics, please don't be too insulted by Kamala's absence. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=704.0s)]
*  If the Democrats, he says, thank you very much. I appreciate it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=709.0s)]
*  If Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening, they would have just sent Joe Biden. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=715.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself, but don't worry, he'll say that he was. He's going to say he was. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=721.0s)]
*  We all know that Kamala likes to giggle incessantly. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=728.0s)]
*  Why did she skip out on the dinner after all her campaign is desperately trying to make up ground after more than two weeks of horrible polls and horrible media appearances? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=734.0s)]
*  Let's look at it this way. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=744.0s)]
*  At this point in 2016, real clear politics average showed Hillary Clinton with a seven point lead over Donald Trump, and she lost in 2020. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=745.0s)]
*  Same average had Biden up by nearly nine, 8.9 percent, and that race was decided by a few thousand votes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=753.0s)]
*  But now Harris is barely holding on to a one point lead in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=760.0s)]
*  Both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden had substantial leads. Now Donald Trump has the edge. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=766.0s)]
*  So let's be clear. Look, anything, especially with Democrats and 51 former Intel officials, anything can happen in 18 days. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=771.0s)]
*  But there is real panic on the left, including fake news CNN. Look at this analysis. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=781.0s)]
*  Here's the deal. If you believe that Donald Trump has somehow become less popular over time, let me change your mind about that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=788.0s)]
*  In fact, he is more popular at this point in the campaign than he was at this point in the 2020 campaign or the 2016 campaign. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=795.0s)]
*  The momentum of Kamala Harris has stalled, and I think they feel like they have to change something that's going on in their campaign because they were seeing a rise. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=802.0s)]
*  And now it has stalled out. Look, she's still more popular than Trump. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=810.0s)]
*  But look, Joe Biden was more popular than Trump, much more and barely won. And Hillary Clinton was more popular than Donald Trump and lost. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=813.0s)]
*  Let me take this moment and urge caution. 2022 is supposed to be a red wave. Didn't work out that way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=821.0s)]
*  I'm telling all of my friends in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, please assume that your vote will decide this election. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=827.0s)]
*  Take nothing here for granted. But Bernie Sanders are the top Democrats. They are openly worried about the critical swing state. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=839.0s)]
*  For example, in this case, Pennsylvania, according to Politico, quote, Dems see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in Pennsylvania. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=846.0s)]
*  There are also tonight concerns about Michigan, quote, Harris went to Detroit to appeal to black voters. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=855.0s)]
*  They're still skeptical. And here's David Brooks from the New York Times. Why the heck isn't she running away with this? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=862.0s)]
*  Well, let me answer that question. For starters, everything about Kamala Harris and her campaign, it is fake. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=870.0s)]
*  It is phony. It is fraudulent. She didn't get a single vote in the primary, democracy and peril, and was installed by party elites. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=876.0s)]
*  Her website only recently published a policy section, which was basically a cut and paste from the Biden campaign and all of her own recently held radical beliefs [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=885.0s)]
*  that her stated positions and her own words that we have played over and over again have now all of a sudden changed, according to anonymous campaign aides. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=896.0s)]
*  The moment she became her party's nominee and she now pretends that she had said nothing about any of these things. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=905.0s)]
*  She had nothing to do with all of the catastrophes from the Biden-Harris administration, although she wouldn't do anything differently. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=913.0s)]
*  After bragging she was the last person in the room for every major decision. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=920.0s)]
*  And then to top it off, her running mate is, well, a gesticulating weirdo. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=925.0s)]
*  I best is the best description I can come up with with a deep affection for the communist Chinese. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=930.0s)]
*  And both Walls and Harris have long held radical, extreme, far left beliefs, including support for ending capitalism in favor of New Green Deal, radical Marxism. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=936.0s)]
*  At the very least, for everyone watching tonight, your taxes, they will go up in the first year of a Harris administration. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=947.0s)]
*  Your take home pay will be less. Inflation will continue to rise. Your quality of life will get worse. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=954.0s)]
*  The only two policies that Kamala has detailed are her plans to massively increase government spending and simultaneously increase a number of different taxes, even unrealized capital gains and not just on the wealthy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=960.0s)]
*  And by the way, the border crisis. Oh, that's going to get way worse. Terrorists, gang members, cartels, convicted murderers, you know, the ones that killed dozens of Americans, rapists that raped dozens of Americans, hundreds of other Americans, victims of violent crimes, all the human trafficking, drug trafficking, all the Americans killed, victimized by criminal Harris-Biden unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=975.0s)]
*  If you think she did a bad job as borders are just wait, God forbid, if she was ever president. According to this analysis from the left-leaning Brookings Institution, a Harris presidency will allow another 12.3 million illegal immigrants into our country. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1001.0s)]
*  And you could rest assured they'll be unvetted also. But tonight, Kamala thinks she could just lie, blame Donald Trump all the way to the White House and demonize and call him a fascist and a racist and have her surrogates call him a Nazi. That's their closing argument. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1018.0s)]
*  Unfortunately for her, she's not doing a very good job. It is now more clear than ever why she got virtually no support from the 20 in the 2020 Democratic primary. Take a look. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1032.0s)]
*  I took on the big banks and fought to deliver $20 billion for middle class families that faced foreclosure. I stood up to veterans and stood up for, excuse me, stood up for veterans and students being scammed. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1044.0s)]
*  I stood up to veterans. Well, sorry, that was kind of like her Joe moment. Anyone can have one. Anyway, it's clear she needs help. And now both Barack and Michelle Obama, they're hitting the campaign trail this week after, of course, the disaster in Pennsylvania when Barack was out there scolding African American men and accusing them of sexism, saying, quote, the brothers aren't coming out for Kamala. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1059.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, former President Trump was in the Bronx. He was at a barbershop, just talking, listening to the current concerns of everyday Americans. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQlbE5jcQw&t=1087.0s)]
