# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 9, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI)
*  ...to profiles and incompetence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=3.2s)]
*  Now, if you're an LA resident [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=7.36s)]
*  and you're looking for reassurance, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=9.68s)]
*  and you're looking for reassurance from your mayor, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=11.84s)]
*  and it was last night, well, this is what you heard. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=14.56s)]
*  Right now, if you need help, emergency information, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=18.04s)]
*  resources, and shelter is available. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  All of this can be found at URL. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=24.04s)]
*  Los Angeles, together is how we will get through this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=27.96s)]
*  Okay, I watched that live. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=33.04s)]
*  That woman is actually the mayor of the city [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=35.72s)]
*  that's burning down. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=39.36s)]
*  You cannot make this up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=40.88s)]
*  And today, as six fires are raging across the region, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=43.08s)]
*  Karen Bass tried her best to sound more convincing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  We need to help others, help our neighbors. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=52.72s)]
*  And first and foremost, we need to stay united. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=56.04s)]
*  We need to stay strong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=59.8s)]
*  A united LA is the way we will recover, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=61.64s)]
*  is the way we rebuild our communities. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=65.88s)]
*  Now, I'll translate for you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=68.64s)]
*  Stay united for her means don't ask me any questions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=70.36s)]
*  Again, but it's nice sentiments, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=73.52s)]
*  Stay united. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=74.72s)]
*  But was she united? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=76.0s)]
*  United with her constituents when she skipped town for Ghana, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=77.52s)]
*  despite clear and early warnings of severe wind conditions [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=80.52s)]
*  that experts warned could trigger fast moving fires. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=84.32s)]
*  Now, in times of crisis, we want, we need [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  elected officials in place whom we respect and trust, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  even if we didn't vote for them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=94.96s)]
*  But that requires those officials to demonstrate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  managerial talent and thoughtful preparation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=99.55999999999999s)]
*  Mayor Bass showed neither, which was obvious in the Q&A. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  My crew and I arrived shortly after it started. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=108.6s)]
*  And for several hours, we watched as hundreds of homes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=111.4s)]
*  in a neighborhood burned to the ground. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=115.16s)]
*  We did not see a single fire engine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=117.0s)]
*  We watched as good Samaritans guided traffic. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=120.12s)]
*  What explains this lack of preparation and rapid response? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=123.6s)]
*  Let me just say first and foremost, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=128.48s)]
*  my number one focus is that we have to protect lives. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=131.24s)]
*  We have to save lives and we have to save homes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=135.48s)]
*  Rest assured that when that- [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=139.92s)]
*  But that did not happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  Rest assured, let me finish, rest assured, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  when that is done, when we are safe, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  we will absolutely do an evaluation to look at what worked, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=148.72s)]
*  what didn't work, and to correct or to hold accountable [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=153.2s)]
*  any body, department, individual, et cetera. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=157.88s)]
*  Et cetera. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=162.6s)]
*  Like, we don't need a postmortem. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  We already know what her party's policies [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=167.16s)]
*  and priorities have been. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And Americans can see for themselves [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=171.56s)]
*  what having no water contributed to over the past 72 hours. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=173.28s)]
*  So people are just totally shell-shocked. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=178.68s)]
*  I have so many friends that live in the area. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=181.12s)]
*  One of my dearest said that out of 11 of the 23 families [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  in his granddadder's class, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=187.52s)]
*  okay, 11 of them lost their homes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  11. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=191.88s)]
*  Now, you think of the emotional trauma to children [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  and of course to adults. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=196.08s)]
*  And the property damage? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=198.04s)]
*  Look at this view down the PCH in Malibu. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=200.32s)]
*  Now, the homes there are worth in the millions, as we know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  All the iconic businesses, gone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=206.44s)]
*  The cost to restore these areas could top now $50 billion. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  I bet it's more. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=214.92s)]
*  Making this the costliest fire in US history. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=216.48s)]
*  And I know the Trump administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  will make rebuilding these communities a top priority, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  because that's what America First is all about after all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, of course, the liberals in charge out there [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=227.8s)]
*  have other ideas of what to put first. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=230.24s)]
*  And it wasn't the safety of taxpayers [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  who pay their salaries. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Can you address the criticism now over the budget issue [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  and the slashing, the $17 million slashing? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  I think if you go back and look at the reductions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=242.12s)]
*  that were made, there were no reductions that were made [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=246.4s)]
*  that would have impacted the situation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=250.4s)]
*  And then there was a little bit, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=253.0s)]
*  there was a little, it's most important to understand [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=254.76s)]
*  that we were in tough budgetary times. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=257.96s)]
*  Everybody knew that, but that the impact of our budget [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=260.56s)]
*  really did not impact what we've been going through. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=264.64s)]
*  Now, this woman really thinks we're as stupid as she is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=268.48s)]
*  We're supposed to believe that she, Karen Bass, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=273.0s)]
*  is worried about spending, about budgetary constraints. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=276.4s)]
*  Oh, and it's true that the city [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  has a $300 million budget deficit. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=282.12s)]
*  So I'll ask this, why right after her election [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=284.96s)]
*  did she move to fast track her city sanctuary city status [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=288.04s)]
*  that would shovel millions of dollars out the door [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=291.8s)]
*  to illegal aliens? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=293.92s)]
*  Why'd she do that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=294.76s)]
*  No money for extra firefighters, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=296.52s)]
*  but she pushed to spend $1.2 million for chargers [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=298.16s)]
*  on street lights to establish better climate equity? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=302.76s)]
*  How about the $2.1 million for equity [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=307.64s)]
*  and inclusion programs for the fire department? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=309.84s)]
*  Now, this is the kind of woke nonsense [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=313.64s)]
*  that you can expect in any city, frankly, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  that's run by the far left. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=317.4s)]
*  Got a Democrat mayor, got a city council [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=319.11999999999995s)]
*  without any Republican representation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=321.2s)]
*  And lest you think her deputy could help in this firestorm, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=323.94s)]
*  well, think again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  Meet Brian Williams, her trusted number two, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=328.64s)]
*  who was placed on leave while he's being investigated [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  by the FBI for making bomb threats, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  wish we had his photo up there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=338.98s)]
*  Look, along with droughts, mudslides, fires, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=340.94s)]
*  California suffers under the self-inflicted plague [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=345.32s)]
*  of horrendous leadership. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=348.8s)]
*  Their idea of protecting the public [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  doesn't prioritize preparation for natural disasters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=352.3s)]
*  You know what it prioritizes? Resisting Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  California governor Gavin Newsom announced [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=359.18s)]
*  he is calling for a special session [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=362.22s)]
*  of the California legislature to quote, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  safeguard California values [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=367.3s)]
*  in the face of an incoming Trump administration. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=369.94s)]
*  Specifically, he says he wants to bolster [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=372.5s)]
*  California resources to quote, protect civil rights, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=374.94s)]

*  and immigrant families. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=381.52s)]
*  Of course, that's the priority. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=384.06s)]
*  Newsom asked lawmakers for $25 million [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  to fund his lawsuits and other legal actions [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=388.7s)]
*  to resist, to stop Donald Trump. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=391.88s)]
*  That's their priority. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=394.74s)]
*  And if governor Newsom thinks he'll parlay [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=396.86s)]
*  his wildfire management skills into national office, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=399.06s)]
*  well, I think this clip may come back to haunt him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=403.66s)]
*  What is the situation with the water? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=406.94s)]
*  Obviously in the Palisades, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=408.38s)]
*  it ran out last night in the hydrants. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=409.86s)]
*  I was trying to fire a fire in this block. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=411.1s)]
*  They left because there was no water in the hydrant here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  The local folks are trying to figure that out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=415.5s)]
*  I mean, those hydrants are typical for two or three fires, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  maybe one fire. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=420.6s)]
*  You have something at this scale. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=421.76s)]
*  But again, that's going to be determined by the local. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=422.82s)]
*  Maybe he should go into acting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  because he kind of looked the part, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=427.3s)]
*  You see him with that jacket and the hat and yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=434.26s)]
*  Everybody knows how much I love California. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=436.42s)]
*  It's where most of my family lives. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=438.74s)]
*  No one deserves the type of incompetent, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=441.36s)]
*  DEI-obsessed leadership [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=444.18s)]
*  that has produced such disastrous results. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=446.74s)]
*  Not just this wildfire management, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=449.86s)]
*  but everything else that happens in California. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  So we must do better. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=455.18s)]
*  And I believe President Trump and his team [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=456.74s)]
*  will be part of that solution. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=458.26s)]
*  The angle expects to see a whole of government approach here, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  including support from Republicans on Capitol Hill. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=463.12s)]
*  I'll talk to John Thune in a few moments. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=466.02s)]
*  Got to rebuild LA, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=468.42s)]
*  got to take every possible federal measure [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=469.98s)]
*  to prevent this sort of bungling from happening again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=472.14s)]
*  These people are fellow Americans. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=477.1s)]
*  We're not going to desert them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=478.5s)]
*  And I look forward to 2028, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=480.18s)]
*  when President Trump will welcome the world again [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=483.34s)]
*  to the LA Olympics. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  I was there in 1984 and 2028 has got to be amazing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  And then we can all take pride in the rebirth [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=492.78s)]
*  of this great American city. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=495.46s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=497.96s)]
*  ["The Big Bang"] [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=498.94s)]
*  Hell, that's a house. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=506.97999999999996s)]
*  We can't even go to check on their house. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=509.14s)]
*  Holy, I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=513.38s)]
*  This was our place, our home. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=516.46s)]
*  Five, six, eight, 10 houses in our neighborhood [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=520.7800000000001s)]
*  just gone like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=524.22s)]
*  It appears to be a total loss. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=527.74s)]
*  It's unsafe for us to go inside. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  It's apocalyptic. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  It's chaotic. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=533.62s)]
*  Everything is on fire. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  Everything's on fire. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=539.5400000000001s)]
*  It's like a bomb was dropped on them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=541.16s)]
*  That's from the LA County Sheriff. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=544.08s)]
*  At least five dead, more missing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=546.08s)]
*  The Sheriff says soon the canines will be coming out [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=548.56s)]
*  to sniff through the charcoal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=550.96s)]
*  It's the most destructive fire in LA County history. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=552.72s)]
*  30,000 acres, more than the size of Manhattan. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=555.72s)]
*  $50 billion in damages. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=560.08s)]
*  Thousands of homes, buildings, and businesses [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=562.3s)]
*  burnt to a crisp. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=565.2s)]
*  180,000 people have been forced to evacuate [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=566.72s)]
*  and they don't know when or if they're coming back. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=569.92s)]
*  And Joe Biden's making fire jokes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=572.48s)]
*  Madam Vice President, I know you're directly affected, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=575.56s)]
*  so you fire away. No pun intended. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=578.4s)]
*  Indeed. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=581.8s)]
*  Biden promised that the federal government [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=585.16s)]
*  is going to be paying for everything in California [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=586.7s)]
*  for the next five months. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=589.04s)]
*  People are asking, is that why California [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=591.2s)]
*  doesn't do anything to prevent fires? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=593.0s)]
*  Because they know you and I are going to bail them out? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=594.58s)]
*  Back at the scene, fire victims are chasing down the governor [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=597.8s)]
*  and getting in his face. Watch this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=601.56s)]
*  Governor, I live here, Governor. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=604.68s)]
*  That was my daughter's school, Governor. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=607.0s)]
*  Please tell me what you're going to do. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=608.88s)]

*  Literally talking to the president right now [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=611.76s)]
*  to specifically answer the question [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  of what we can do for you and your daughter. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=616.68s)]
*  Can I hear it? Can I hear your call? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  Because I don't believe it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's literally, I've tried five times, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=623.4s)]
*  that's why I'm walking around to make the call. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=626.44s)]
*  Why is the president not taking your call? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  Because it's not going through. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  Why? So let's get it. Let's get it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=631.48s)]
*  I want to be here when you call the president. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=634.2s)]
*  I appreciate it. I'm doing that right now. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=635.96s)]
*  Everyone who went to school there, they lost their homes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  They lost two homes because they were living in one building another. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=641.8800000000001s)]
*  Why was there no water in the hydrants, Governor? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=645.32s)]
*  That's all literally being ... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=648.12s)]
*  Is it going to be different next time? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=650.0s)]
*  It has to be. It has to be. Of course. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=651.8800000000001s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=654.32s)]
*  Fulfill the hydrants. I would fill them up personally. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=655.6s)]
*  You know that. I would fill up the hydrants myself. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  I understand. But would you do that? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=661.76s)]
*  I would do whatever I can. But you're not. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=664.12s)]
*  We'll be talking to that mom in a little bit. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=667.72s)]
*  But did Gavin just fake a phone call [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=669.36s)]
*  to get out of talking to a voter? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=671.52s)]
*  Is that what we're doing now? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=673.84s)]
*  I'm on the other line with the president. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=675.24s)]
*  Just trying to get some self-service here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=677.6s)]
*  It's a big call. It's too late. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=679.52s)]
*  What's Biden going to do? Make it rain? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=681.64s)]
*  We saw an apartment building engulfed in flames. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=684.4s)]
*  I saw the fire engine pull up this afternoon. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  A fire captain have one of his firefighters [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=690.24s)]
*  attach a hose to a hydrant. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=692.36s)]
*  And that hose didn't fill up, Alex. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=694.2s)]
*  And I asked the captain, out of every 10 hydrants [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=696.88s)]
*  you attach to today, on average, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=700.08s)]
*  how many are you getting full water from? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=702.28s)]
*  He says little to none. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=704.2s)]
*  And it was at that point that really the whole crew stopped, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  looked up at this apartment building, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=709.0s)]
*  and they realized there was nothing they could do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=710.92s)]
*  Even CNN is saying, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=714.16s)]
*  Governor, why can't we put out the fire? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=716.0s)]
*  What is the situation with the water? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=719.56s)]
*  Obviously in the Palisades, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=721.0s)]
*  it ran out last night in the hydrants. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=722.52s)]
*  I was trying to firefighter on this block. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=723.76s)]

*  The local folks are trying to figure that out. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=728.16s)]
*  I mean, just when you have a system [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=730.4s)]
*  that is not dissimilar to what we've seen [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=732.16s)]
*  in other extraordinarily large-scale fires, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=733.5999999999999s)]
*  whether it be pipe, electricity, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  or whether it just be the complete overwhelm of the system. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, those hydrants are typical for two or three fires, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=741.28s)]
*  maybe one fire. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  You have something at this scale. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=745.24s)]
*  But again, that's gonna be determined by the local. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  Cabin's like, ah, the water always runs out with big fires. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=748.88s)]
*  What do you want me to do, grab a hose? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=752.16s)]
*  I'm only the governor. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  Newsom slashed the budget for water projects. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  He blocked the move to bring water into Southern California. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=757.52s)]
*  And he started tearing down dams. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=760.16s)]
*  He hasn't built a single reservoir. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  The last time California built a reservoir, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=766.16s)]
*  almost 50 years ago. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=768.28s)]
*  Instead, they let billions of gallons of stormwater [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=770.6s)]
*  just wash into the sea. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  The hydrants wouldn't be running dry [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  if they stored the stormwater. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  L.A. ranks dead last in the West for saving stormwater. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=779.28s)]
*  This whole episode symbolizes liberalism. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=784.0s)]
*  It doesn't build anything. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=787.0s)]
*  It only destroys. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=788.92s)]
*  Gavin should say, the buck stops with me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=790.92s)]
*  I'm governor, I'm on it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  Instead, he doesn't accept any blame. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=795.76s)]
*  I hate to even ask this question, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  but the president-elect chose to attack you, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=800.48s)]
*  blame you for this. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=803.28s)]
*  It's, uh, one can't even respond to it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=804.48s)]
*  I mean, it's, uh... [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=807.6s)]
*  You know, people are literally fleeing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=809.6s)]
*  People have lost their lives. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  Kids lost their schools. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=814.44s)]
*  Families completely torn asunder. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=817.08s)]
*  Churches burned down. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=819.1600000000001s)]
*  This guy wanted to politicize it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=820.84s)]
*  I-I-I have a lot of thoughts, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=823.08s)]
*  and I know what I want to say. I won't. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=825.4s)]
*  Um, I stood next to a president [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=827.68s)]
*  of the United States of America today, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=829.84s)]
*  and I was proud to be with Joe Biden, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=831.76s)]
*  and he had the backs of every single person in this community. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=833.48s)]
*  He didn't play politics, didn't try to divide any of us. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=835.76s)]
*  People's homes are on fire, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=838.52s)]
*  and they're having to put it out with garden hoses [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=839.84s)]
*  because the politicians can't. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=841.72s)]
*  The mayor, Karen Bass, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=843.92s)]
*  knew the Santa Ana winds were blowing, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=845.44s)]
*  and the National Weather Service was warning her [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=847.48s)]
*  there was a chance of extreme fire. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=849.76s)]
*  And she still hops on a plane to Africa [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=852.16s)]
*  to go to an inauguration of a president she's never met. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=854.32s)]
*  It's a 17-hour flight, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=857.6s)]
*  so she knew if something happened, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  it would take her a day to get back. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=861.4s)]
*  The press is starting to speak up for the people. Listen. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=864.0s)]
*  For several hours, we watched [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=867.52s)]
*  as hundreds of homes in a neighborhood [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=869.6s)]
*  burned to the ground. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=872.12s)]
*  We did not see a single fire engine. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=873.12s)]
*  You were out of the country at the time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=875.72s)]
*  My question to you is, what explains this lack of preparation [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=877.76s)]
*  and rapid response? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me just say, first and foremost, my number one focus, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  and I think the focus of all of us here with one voice, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=888.0s)]
*  is that we have to protect lives, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=891.88s)]
*  we have to save lives, and we have to save homes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=894.48s)]
*  Rest assured that when that... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=898.92s)]
*  But that did not happen. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=900.5999999999999s)]
*  Rest assured, let me finish, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=901.76s)]
*  we will absolutely do an evaluation [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  to look at what worked, what didn't work, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=906.48s)]
*  and to correct or to hold accountable [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=909.4s)]
*  any body, department, individual. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=912.6s)]
*  Bass doesn't respect you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  She's not going to answer your questions. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=918.04s)]
*  She's just going to wait six months [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=920.24s)]
*  and release some whitewashed report, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=921.8s)]
*  pointing fingers at everybody else, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=924.04s)]
*  even though she's in charge. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=925.6s)]
*  Bass didn't even have an evacuation plan. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=928.12s)]
*  They were warned about this a week ahead. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  Actress Sarah Michelle Geller wrote, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=933.72s)]
*  City of LA, you want everyone to evacuate, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  yet you have complete gridlock [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=938.7199999999999s)]
*  and not one traffic cop on the roads helping. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=940.88s)]
*  People got trapped because all these politicians, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  just they know how to run for office, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  and once they get in, they don't know how to run anything. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=949.5999999999999s)]
*  The mayor of LA couldn't even give out [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=953.52s)]
*  a simple website address. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Make no mistake, Los Angeles will rebuild stronger than ever. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=958.0s)]
*  Right now, if you need help, emergency information, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=963.56s)]
*  resources, and shelter is available. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=966.64s)]
*  All of this can be found at URL. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=969.6s)]
*  URL? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=974.8s)]
*  The mayor can't even tell people [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=976.36s)]
*  where to get help during an emergency. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=977.72s)]
*  Who was in charge when Bass was in Africa? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=980.28s)]
*  This is the deputy mayor, Brian Williams, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=983.32s)]
*  but he's been placed on leave [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=986.2s)]
*  because he's under investigation [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=987.44s)]
*  for calling in a bomb threat to City Hall, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=989.32s)]
*  where he works. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=991.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like he was trying to get out of taking a test. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=993.6s)]
*  So who was in charge during the early hours [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=996.96s)]
*  of the worst fire in LA history? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=999.12s)]
*  It's like the White House. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1001.4s)]
*  No one knows who's in charge there either. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1002.6s)]
*  This is so embarrassing. It's aggravating. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1005.4s)]
*  This country has hit rock bottom. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1009.2s)]
*  These are the leaders we voted for. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  It can't get any worse than this. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1014.8000000000001s)]
*  The mayor can't communicate. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1016.88s)]
*  The governor can't get water to a fire. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  That's California politics, though. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1020.36s)]
*  You pay 13 percent state income tax, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1022.28s)]
*  and they can't put out a fire. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1024.56s)]
*  Where's the money going? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1026.6s)]
*  They spent $24 billion last year on the homeless. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1028.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1032.92s)]
*  And what did they spend on preventing these wildfires? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1034.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1037.16s)]
*  Zip. Zip. And in 2019, I think, Newsom said, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1038.44s)]
*  you know, I'm going to take care of the forest [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1041.84s)]
*  and maintain the forest and do all that kind of stuff. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1043.32s)]
*  He didn't do anything. Didn't do anything. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1045.16s)]
*  And then on top of that, they cut the water off. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1046.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It's all funny. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1048.96s)]
*  And then I think all our tax dollars [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1050.88s)]
*  probably went for Gavin's hair gel. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1052.52s)]
*  And then he gets on TV and pretends like everything's great. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1054.28s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1057.04s)]
*  California is the best. We have the best state. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1058.44s)]
*  We have the most amazing economy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1060.72s)]
*  I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind, dude. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1062.28s)]
*  You've ruined this state. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  It personally ruined it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1066.0s)]
*  People and businesses have been fleeing California for years. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1067.8400000000001s)]

*  Until now. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  All these people who were deep blue Democrats [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1091.44s)]

*  The entire country's starting to grapple [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1130.28s)]
*  with the reality at the same time. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1132.32s)]
*  All races, all classes have gotten a taste [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1134.36s)]
*  of what it feels like to be ignored by dumb politicians [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1136.96s)]
*  who never deserved our vote in the first place [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1140.2s)]

*  This country used to do things the right way. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1144.6s)]
*  We used to be able to build things. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1147.28s)]
*  We used to be able to protect fish [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1149.28s)]
*  and have enough water to fight fires. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1151.1599999999999s)]
*  We used to be able to take care of the mentally ill homeless [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1153.72s)]
*  and the people who had homes. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  We promoted people based on merit [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1159.3999999999999s)]
*  and tried not to discriminate against people [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  who were different. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1164.04s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1165.68s)]
*  Isn't California tired of learning this lesson? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1167.52s)]
*  Now, in just a moment, we're going to show you [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1171.08s)]
*  a remarkable scene in D.C. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1172.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1175.1599999999999s)]
*  the Clintons, Kamala Harris all gathered together [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1178.6s)]
*  for Jimmy Carter's funeral, and coming up, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1181.6s)]
*  we have a body language expert who's going to analyze. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1183.8s)]
*  It appears to be a very friendly conversation [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1186.96s)]
*  between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1189.48s)]
*  I've got to find out what that was about. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1192.08s)]
*  While Kamala looked on, well, seemingly with envy, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1194.04s)]
*  but first, a warning to those on the left, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1197.32s)]
*  those of you that are obsessed, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1199.84s)]
*  those of you that believe with religious fervor [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1202.36s)]
*  in this eco-socialist, Marxist, status utopia [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1206.48s)]
*  under the Green New Deal, it's not going to end well. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1210.48s)]
*  Pay attention to what's happening in California. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, free universal healthcare, daycare, childcare, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1216.9199999999998s)]
*  guaranteed healthy food and housing and retirement, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  everything taken care of, cradle to grave, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  womb to the tomb, college tuition, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1226.28s)]
*  universal basic income, dedication to putting [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1229.32s)]
*  CO2 emissions above all else. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  It might sound alarming still to some of you. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1235.32s)]
*  It is, look at California, it is a disaster. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1238.52s)]
*  You know, take a look at this state, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1242.36s)]
*  this so-called progressive, one party, deep blue state. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1243.8s)]
*  They have been pursuing their own version [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1247.6s)]
*  of the Green New Deal for many, many years now. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1250.7199999999998s)]
*  They spend $31 billion a year [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1253.56s)]
*  only on social welfare programs. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  The state's $322 billion budget also funded [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  some fire prevention and water projects. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1263.32s)]
*  None of them have been completed [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1265.6799999999998s)]
*  because of permitting, environmental reviews. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1267.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it was what, 11 years ago, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1271.04s)]
*  California broke ground on a $100 billion [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1273.24s)]
*  high-speed rail system. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1277.48s)]
*  It's nowhere near completion. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1279.44s)]
*  In fact, the first section of tracks [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1281.28s)]
*  has not even been finished. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1284.08s)]
*  In LA, throughout the state, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1286.16s)]
*  billions and billions are also spent on DEI programs. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1287.96s)]
*  Billions more on green energy projects [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1292.6s)]
*  like LA's 800 electric street sweepers. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1296.08s)]
*  They cost 800 grand a piece at the very same time. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1300.92s)]
*  The city can't find enough money [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1305.24s)]
*  for its fire department to fund them. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1307.36s)]
*  Recently, the mayor cut $17.5 million [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1310.4s)]
*  from the department's budget. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1314.6s)]
*  The fire chief wrote a letter to Mayor Bass warning [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1316.88s)]
*  the budget cuts would severely limit [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1320.24s)]
*  their disaster response capabilities like this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1322.4s)]
*  Keep in mind, wildfires, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  they are common in Southern California. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1327.84s)]
*  Mayor Bass apparently doesn't care. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1330.04s)]
*  She, of course, was in Ghana when the fire broke out [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1332.28s)]
*  when she did finally return to the US. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1335.76s)]
*  The mayor ducked any and all questions [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1337.96s)]
*  about her role in the disaster. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1341.32s)]
*  The next day, she refused to take any responsibility [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1343.56s)]
*  and didn't even know where to direct people [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1347.56s)]
*  on the web or what number to call. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1351.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1353.36s)]
*  We have to protect lives, we have to save lives, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1354.76s)]
*  and we have to save homes. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1358.56s)]
*  You rest assured that when that- [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1361.28s)]
*  But that did not happen. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1363.4s)]
*  Rest assured, let me finish, rest assured, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1364.28s)]
*  when that is done, when we are safe, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1367.24s)]
*  when lives have been saved and homes have been saved, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1370.36s)]
*  we will absolutely do an evaluation [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1373.4s)]
*  to look at what worked, what didn't work, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1376.44s)]
*  and to correct or to hold accountable [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1379.4s)]
*  any body, department, individual, et cetera. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1382.6s)]
*  But my focus right now is on the lives and on the homes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1386.28s)]
*  Do you think your leadership was effective [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1390.64s)]
*  while responding to this disaster? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1392.96s)]
*  I just said what I believe is the most important thing [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1395.04s)]
*  for us to do right now, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1399.04s)]
*  and that is gonna continue to be my focus, thank you. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1400.4s)]
*  Wow, a little too little, a little too late. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1403.44s)]
*  They could have cleared the brush, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  the kindling for these fires. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1407.48s)]
*  They could have had control burns [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  to prevent these fires from getting out of control, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1410.96s)]
*  and they could have had water available [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1413.64s)]
*  from the minute they started. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1415.6200000000001s)]
*  Karen Bass wasn't the only so-called leader in California [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1417.24s)]
*  passing the buck this week. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1420.4s)]
*  We told you the fire hydrants, they ran out of water, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1422.24s)]
*  in part because of statewide environmental regulations. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1424.84s)]
*  L.A. County, meanwhile, they sent [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1428.72s)]
*  a widespread evacuation order by mistake last night, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1431.24s)]
*  causing mass panic and confusion. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1434.76s)]
*  Over on Fake News CNN, well, California governor [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1437.24s)]
*  or old buddy Gavin Newsom took absolutely no responsibility. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1440.44s)]
*  Well, that's up to the local people. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1443.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1445.68s)]
*  What is the situation with the water? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1447.2s)]
*  Obviously, in Palisades, it ran out last night, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1448.6s)]
*  in the hydrants, I was talking to the firefighter [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1450.8s)]
*  in this block, they left, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1453.0s)]
*  because there was no water in the hydrant here. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1453.84s)]
*  Local folks are trying to figure that out. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, just when you have a system [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1458.0s)]
*  where it's not dissimilar to what we've seen [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1459.76s)]
*  in other extraordinarily large-scale fires, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1461.2399999999998s)]
*  whether it be pipe, electricity, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1463.7199999999998s)]
*  or whether it just be the complete overwhelm of the system. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1465.76s)]
*  I mean, those hydrants are typical for two or three fires, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1468.9199999999998s)]
*  maybe one fire, you have something at this scale, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1471.7199999999998s)]
*  but again, that's gonna be determined by the local. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  I thought you were saying part of. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1476.1999999999998s)]
*  You local folks, do you figure it out? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1478.28s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1480.82s)]
*  You have a state known for wildfires. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1482.1399999999999s)]
*  They don't have hydrants that have water. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1484.46s)]
*  The state regularly is dumping millions [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1486.78s)]
*  and millions of gallons of water into the Pacific Ocean [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1489.06s)]
*  instead of filling reservoirs [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1492.7s)]
*  for such emergencies like this. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1495.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1497.34s)]
*  Because of environmental concerns about a delta smelt [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1498.1599999999999s)]
*  or whatever small fish they're trying to protect. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1500.78s)]
*  But according to the governor, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1504.46s)]
*  the locals will need to sort it out themselves, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1505.8999999999999s)]
*  and it's up to local mayors like that genius mayor of LA, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1508.9s)]
*  Mayor Bass, to figure this out. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1512.8600000000001s)]
*  And today Newsom even tried to avoid [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1514.8600000000001s)]
*  answering questions from a woman. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1516.94s)]
*  This woman lost everything, everything. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1519.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, she's desperate. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1522.02s)]
*  The governor seemingly pretending to get on the phone [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1523.5800000000002s)]
*  with Joe Biden. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1526.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1527.46s)]
*  That was my daughter's school, governor. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1529.0600000000002s)]
*  Please tell me what you're gonna do. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1530.98s)]
*  I'm not gonna hurt him, I promise. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1532.38s)]
*  I'm literally talking to the president right now [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1533.7800000000002s)]
*  to specifically answer the question of what we can do [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1536.54s)]
*  for you and your daughter. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1539.46s)]
*  Can I hear it? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1540.66s)]
*  Can I hear your call? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1541.74s)]
*  Because I don't believe it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1542.74s)]
*  Uh, I'm sorry. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1544.26s)]
*  There's literally, I've tried five times, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1546.46s)]
*  that's why I'm walking around to make the call. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1548.5s)]
*  Why is the president not taking your call? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1549.9s)]
*  Because it's not going through. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1552.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1553.54s)]
*  So I have to get self-service. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1554.38s)]
*  So let's get it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1555.2s)]
*  Let's get it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1556.04s)]
*  I wanna be here when you call the president. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1556.88s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1558.06s)]
*  I'm doing that right now. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1558.9s)]
*  And it's to immediately get reimbursements, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1560.7s)]
*  individual assistance, and to help young people. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1562.98s)]
*  I'm so sorry, especially for your daughter. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1566.14s)]
*  I have four kids losing the school. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1568.82s)]
*  Everyone who went to school there, they lost their home. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1571.06s)]
*  They lost two homes because they were living in one [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1574.5s)]
*  and building another. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1576.74s)]
*  Governor, please tell me, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1578.38s)]
*  what are you gonna do with the president right now? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1579.74s)]
*  We're getting the resources to help rebuild. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1581.98s)]
*  Why was there no water in the hydrants, governor? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1584.7s)]
*  That's all literally being- [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1588.34s)]
*  Is it gonna be different next time? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1589.46s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1591.3s)]
*  Has to be, of course. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1592.54s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1593.78s)]
*  Fulfill the hydrants. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1595.1s)]
*  I would fill them up personally, you know that. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1595.9799999999998s)]
*  I literally have to. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1598.3s)]
*  I would fill up the hydrants myself. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  I understand. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1601.3799999999999s)]
*  But would you do that? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1602.2199999999998s)]
*  I would do whatever I can. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1603.58s)]
*  But you're not. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1604.86s)]
*  It's what they didn't do beforehand. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1607.1399999999999s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of people now must begin [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1609.4199999999998s)]
*  the process of trying to rebuild their lives. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1612.54s)]
*  And by the way, trying to call Joe Biden, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1615.4199999999998s)]
*  given his frequent naps, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1617.62s)]
*  it's probably unlikely he was on the phone [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1619.86s)]
*  or willing to pick up the phone. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1622.2199999999998s)]
*  Needless to say, there's virtually no leadership [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1623.98s)]
*  out of Washington, D.C. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1626.66s)]
*  And today, the president, kind of like yesterday, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1628.38s)]
*  only concerned about himself, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1631.74s)]
*  actually joked about the fire. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1633.78s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1636.14s)]
*  While introducing Kamala Harris, take a look. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1637.02s)]
*  Madam Vice President, I know you're directly affected, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1640.38s)]
*  so you fire away. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1643.22s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1645.8600000000001s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1646.7s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1648.54s)]
*  No pun intended, really, Joe? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1650.66s)]
*  Yesterday's presser, Biden, made it all about himself. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1652.74s)]
*  He was proud of the fact that he was a great-grandfather [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1656.1s)]
*  and only seemed concerned about his son, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1659.54s)]
*  zero-experience Hunter, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1661.6599999999999s)]
*  and that he may have lost his house. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1663.54s)]
*  His vice president, meanwhile, a longtime advocate [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1665.62s)]
*  for the less radical, socialist, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1668.34s)]
*  Green New Deal equity obsession. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1670.02s)]
*  Well, here she is in 2022, vowing to dole out [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1672.34s)]
*  any disaster relief on the basis of racial [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1675.86s)]
*  and environmental equity. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1679.22s)]
*  Listen. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1681.02s)]
*  It is our lowest-income communities [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1682.78s)]
*  and our communities of color that are most impacted [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1686.54s)]
*  by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1690.82s)]
*  that are not of their own making. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1696.3799999999999s)]
*  And women. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1698.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1699.6999999999998s)]
*  And so we have to address this in a way [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1700.54s)]
*  that is about giving resources based on equity, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1703.58s)]
*  understanding that we fight for equality, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1707.1799999999998s)]
*  but we also need to fight for equity, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1709.54s)]
*  understanding not everyone starts out at the same place. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1711.02s)]
*  And if we want people to be in an equal place, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1713.82s)]
*  sometimes we have to take into account those disparities. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1716.1399999999999s)]
*  Gotta take that into account. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1719.94s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1721.46s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1722.3799999999999s)]
*  Keep in mind, California is the greatest example [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1723.22s)]
*  of how this woke, equity-obsessed, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1726.86s)]
*  environmental, radical socialism, Green New Deal, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1729.5s)]
*  statism, Marxism, socialism, this is how it plays out. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1732.94s)]
*  This is what America avoided in this last election. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1737.98s)]
*  Feel-good programs prioritized over infrastructure, safety. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1741.8600000000001s)]
*  Leaders are chosen for their identity [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1746.6200000000001s)]
*  instead of their merit. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1748.74s)]
*  The city's preparedness, capabilities decline. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1750.1s)]
*  It is a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1753.58s)]
*  That would be, this would be, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1756.7s)]
*  Kamala's America, God forbid if she won. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1758.74s)]
*  Thank God all of you stopped that madness from happening. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1761.78s)]

*  we witnessed this all week in California. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1781.3400000000001s)]

*  I've always said, whatever name, whatever manifestation, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1785.9s)]
*  socialism, Marxism, statism, whatever manifestation, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1788.9s)]
*  you get unfulfilled promises. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1792.5800000000002s)]
*  Then you end up paying and losing a fortune of money. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1794.54s)]
*  People are poor. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1798.22s)]
*  And then you calculate how much freedom you gave up [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1799.34s)]
*  in the name of false security. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1801.82s)]
*  Sadly, thousands of homes, businesses were destroyed [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1803.6599999999999s)]

*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1824.14s)]

*  President Biden used a briefing on the fires [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1829.0600000000002s)]
*  to brag that he's now a great grandfather. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1831.9s)]
*  Even worse, when aides rushed him to leave, he said, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1836.3400000000001s)]
*  hey buddy, where's the fire? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1839.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1841.0600000000002s)]
*  But in LA, the winds are still so strong, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1847.42s)]
*  Governor Newsom has ordered fire crews [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1849.66s)]
*  to batten down Tom Cruise. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1851.5s)]
*  And frightened citizens are urged to shelter [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1855.14s)]
*  inside Julia Roberts' mouth. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1857.38s)]
*  True, I haven't seen this many Californians run for their lives [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1864.98s)]

*  Governor Gavin Newsom is receiving [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1875.42s)]

*  firefighters made sure to keep Newsom far from the blaze. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1890.26s)]

*  Many are criticizing the chief of the LA fire department [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1901.26s)]
*  for making inclusivity the top priority [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1903.86s)]
*  when hiring new recruits. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1906.74s)]
*  True, you want inclusivity? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1908.7s)]
*  Maybe include a chief who knows how to fight fires. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1910.66s)]
*  Instead they put identity before competence. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1914.54s)]
*  Because really in California, who you sleep with, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1917.26s)]
*  it shouldn't make you fire chief. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1919.9s)]
*  Although it can make you attorney general. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1922.22s)]
*  Long walk, huh? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1927.58s)]
*  ABC's David Muir is being mocked for using clothes pins [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1932.66s)]
*  to cinch his jacket more tightly around his chest [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1936.8999999999999s)]
*  while reporting from the scene. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1940.86s)]
*  He was also overheard asking a crew member, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1944.02s)]
*  does this burning city make me look fat? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1946.54s)]
*  Let's only hope that the sock he puts in his crotch [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1954.8999999999999s)]
*  is flame retardant. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1958.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, many critics say LA mayor Karen Bass [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1964.02s)]
*  should have canceled her trip to Ghana [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1966.58s)]
*  before the fires broke out. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1968.46s)]
*  I mean, if she wanted to go to a foreign land [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1970.3s)]
*  where no one speaks English, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1972.02s)]
*  she could have stayed in California. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  Even so, Bass called for unity during this crisis today. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1976.4199999999998s)]
*  But there is unity, Karen. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1980.74s)]
*  Everyone thinks you're a idiot. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1982.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1986.1s)]
*  Back on it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1990.6599999999999s)]
*  Look out, tricky dick. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1992.5s)]
*  There's a new worst president in town. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1994.06s)]
*  According to a new Gallup poll, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1997.1399999999999s)]
*  Biden is the lowest rated of any president [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=1998.46s)]
*  in the last 65 years other than Nixon. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2001.98s)]
*  But to be fair to Nixon, compared to Biden's scandals, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2006.62s)]
*  Watergate looks like a broken tail light. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2009.86s)]
*  Now, when you rate Biden the worst since Nixon, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2012.78s)]
*  you're saying he's the worst ever [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2015.3799999999999s)]
*  because pollsters only ask about presidents [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2017.4199999999998s)]
*  that people have lived under going back to Kennedy. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2019.74s)]
*  Unless you're some historian, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2023.3s)]
*  you're really capable of rating presidents in your memory. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2024.78s)]
*  Hell, Biden himself doesn't even remember [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2028.22s)]
*  his own presidency. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2029.98s)]
*  So the worst since Nixon is really the worst ever. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2033.1s)]
*  And keep in mind, the public hates Biden [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2037.06s)]
*  even with most of the press covering up his dementia [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2039.5s)]
*  for this whole term. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2043.18s)]
*  And sure, they panicked and piled on him [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2044.82s)]
*  after that deadly debate, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2046.7s)]
*  but they can't make us forget [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2048.46s)]
*  how many times they lied for him. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2049.78s)]
*  Hell, they're still doing it, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2052.3s)]
*  even when he does stuff like this. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2053.6600000000003s)]
*  It's astounding what's happened. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2056.9s)]
*  With only one piece of good news, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2059.5800000000004s)]
*  my son lives out here and his wife, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2060.9s)]
*  they got a notification yesterday [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2063.9s)]
*  their home was probably burning around. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2065.6600000000003s)]
*  Today, it appears that maybe he's still standing, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2067.94s)]
*  we're not sure. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2070.6200000000003s)]
*  But the good news is I'm a great grandfather as of today. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2072.1400000000003s)]

*  Yeah, it's really bad. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2082.3s)]
*  Sorry your city's burning, but I brought cigars. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2087.5800000000004s)]
*  Anyone got a match? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2090.42s)]
*  I'm gonna be a great granddaddy. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2092.42s)]
*  Ah, ah! [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2094.5s)]
*  What a clown. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2098.78s)]
*  I guess we can be grateful he didn't ask Jimmy Carter [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2100.6600000000003s)]
*  to stand up at the eulogy. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2102.78s)]
*  So what was immediate before all this, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2107.78s)]
*  when it was obvious Biden was 25th Amendment, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2109.42s)]
*  he was going to be a great material. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2112.02s)]
*  Let's turn to Iraqi war vet [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2114.26s)]
*  and Purple Heart recipient Brian Williams, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2115.7400000000002s)]
*  who said nothing yet calls people out for saying nothing. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2118.18s)]
*  On the media's coverage of Joe, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2122.46s)]
*  he told the Washington Post, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2124.14s)]
*  quote, it's actually insulting, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2125.78s)]
*  a gross disservice to those watching and listening [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2127.62s)]
*  because it doesn't match what they just saw [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2130.54s)]
*  or heard for themselves. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2132.54s)]
*  Funny, that sounds like he's talking about [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2134.66s)]
*  every broadcast he did for NBC Nightly News. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2136.06s)]
*  Quote, it was crushing to watch [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2139.54s)]
*  a journalist attempt to generate the words [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2141.6600000000003s)]

*  seemingly unable to complete a sentence or thought [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2146.82s)]

*  Well, here's a few that come to mind. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2155.78s)]
*  How about decrepit, demented, confused, obtuse, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2157.6600000000003s)]
*  and bad-sh-t crazy? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2160.26s)]
*  But I guess Brian doesn't need a war zone anymore [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2166.06s)]
*  to pretend to be brave. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2168.6600000000003s)]
*  He once bragged that his helicopter got shot down [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2170.34s)]
*  in war-torn Iraq, which was the biggest lie [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2172.7000000000003s)]
*  since Hillary claimed she took sniper fire in Bosnia. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2175.3s)]
*  Turns out it was the Red Cross shooting donuts at her [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2179.42s)]
*  from a T-shirt cannon. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2182.34s)]
*  She caught him with her mouth, it was amazing. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2185.6600000000003s)]
*  And Brian could have spoken up at any point [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2189.38s)]
*  in the past four years, why didn't he? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2191.34s)]
*  It's the same reason the rest of them didn't speak up. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2193.78s)]
*  They all knew Biden's brain was rancid applesauce, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2195.78s)]
*  but they also knew if they said anything, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2198.9s)]
*  ooh, their peers wouldn't like them. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2200.7400000000002s)]
*  The truth took a backseat quicker [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2204.2200000000003s)]
*  than me and Larry Kudlow at a drive-in movie. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2206.1800000000003s)]
*  He's all hands. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2211.6600000000003s)]
*  They told the biggest lie [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2215.02s)]
*  in the history of presidential politics, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2216.54s)]
*  Joe Biden is fit to serve. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2219.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, to serve what, carrots to his imaginary pet bunny? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2222.3s)]
*  But they parroted these lies because they were cowards, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2225.62s)]
*  all of them. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2228.7799999999997s)]
*  And Hollywood was no better, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2229.94s)]
*  comedians suffered the same weakness, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2231.46s)]
*  claiming they were pressured to stay in line. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2233.42s)]
*  Here's Jim Gavigan admitting that people told him [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2235.8599999999997s)]
*  not to criticize Joe or Harris. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2238.18s)]
*  What I thought was interesting about this election is, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2241.06s)]
*  and maybe because it was so important, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2244.54s)]
*  and maybe because it was such a short election [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2247.38s)]
*  for Kamala Harris, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2251.9s)]
*  Kamala, that people were like, don't criticize her. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2255.22s)]
*  And I'm like, that's actually bad to have that approach. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2258.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2262.5s)]
*  And I think hindsight, a lot of people feel that way. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2263.34s)]
*  Well, they call it hindsight for a reason, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2266.58s)]
*  because that's what you see when you're kissing ass. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2269.18s)]
*  Here's the suddenly brave Whitney Cummings. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2273.06s)]
*  It's just wild to me that we are in a time [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2276.66s)]
*  where if you are on the left [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2280.22s)]
*  and you don't criticize your party, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2283.02s)]
*  how much do you even care about your party? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2288.54s)]
*  It's like, what's going on in the left? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2289.3799999999997s)]
*  I had to, like, I finally just broke. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2290.66s)]
*  I just think that if you love your party, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2292.8999999999996s)]
*  you have to be able to criticize it, you know? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2295.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2298.18s)]
*  The question is, who pressured them to stay in line? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2299.5s)]
*  Did either comic have a boss who might fire them? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2301.7799999999997s)]
*  No, they stayed in line because their agents, managers, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2305.2999999999997s)]
*  and their own wallets told them to. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2307.74s)]
*  And also their peers, they were scared of upsetting people [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2310.46s)]
*  they wanted to impress. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2312.2200000000003s)]
*  What if they ran into Seth Rogen at Whole Foods [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2313.7000000000003s)]
*  or Chelsea Handler at the free clinic? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2317.2200000000003s)]
*  Or Leo DiCaprio at their daughter's high school graduation? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2324.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, comics with real guts for the past four years, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2331.6600000000003s)]
*  well, they were on this show [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2335.54s)]
*  or writing for it behind the scenes. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2337.42s)]
*  They said what they thought and they shared the risk. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2339.66s)]
*  They told the truth about what they saw [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2342.42s)]
*  and they lost work for it. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2344.58s)]
*  Nick DiPaolo says he's been canceled more times [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2346.8599999999997s)]
*  than a Chris Christie gym membership. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2349.66s)]
*  They lost jobs and they lost friends. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2355.2999999999997s)]
*  I hear Joe Mackey couldn't get laid this entire time, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2357.3399999999997s)]
*  as well as before or after. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2361.7799999999997s)]
*  Fortunately, this show helped them pack halls [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2367.54s)]
*  and clubs and now suddenly everyone else agrees with them [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2369.46s)]
*  and us without ever admitting we were right, of course. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2372.1s)]
*  But hey, it only ended up costing them an election [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2376.7s)]
*  and the public's goodwill. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2379.02s)]
*  Better luck next time, guys. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2380.94s)]
*  Maybe then you'll have grown some balls. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2382.1s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2385.18s)]
*  She owns a timeshare in It's a Small World, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2388.66s)]
*  co-host of America's Newsroom and The Vibe, Jada Burrito. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2392.58s)]
*  His ex-wife is like a California wildfire [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2399.98s)]
*  because she took everything from him too. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2403.18s)]
*  Actor, comedian and writer, Jamie Lissow. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2406.86s)]
*  She's narrowed her baby names down to two names, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2414.2200000000003s)]
*  Ron and Paul. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2417.7s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2419.42s)]
*  and Fox News contributor, Kat Toom. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2420.82s)]
*  He gets liberals the blues and has a hard time buying shoes. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2422.5s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2429.5s)]
*  and former NWA world champion, Tyrus. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2430.98s)]
*  So, Dana, I love this poll. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2438.06s)]
*  Joe is now the worst president ever, but what if he had won? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2439.9s)]
*  They probably would have him as the best president ever. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2444.26s)]
*  Now it's okay, apparently now it's all okay [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2446.42s)]
*  to say what was on everybody's mind [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2450.7s)]
*  because there's no risk involved. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2453.42s)]
*  You gotta imagine that the people [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2456.22s)]
*  at the Richard Nixon library are like, finally. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2457.38s)]
*  Because they've been stalwart ever since. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2462.14s)]
*  You've been out there. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2464.3399999999997s)]
*  They're like, actually, this is all the things [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2465.5s)]
*  that happened in this presidency. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2467.18s)]
*  I think that most, well, most presidents do go up [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2468.62s)]
*  in ratings after they leave office. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2471.8199999999997s)]
*  I do not think that's gonna happen with Joe Biden [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2475.3399999999997s)]
*  because more and more you find out, wait, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2478.22s)]
*  and that too, and that too, and the lying [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2481.38s)]
*  about him running circles around them [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2483.62s)]
*  behind the scenes at the White House. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2486.02s)]
*  And what I'm really wondering is [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2488.06s)]
*  with an approval rating like this, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2490.06s)]
*  what are the book deals that his senior staff [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2493.26s)]
*  are going to get? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2496.74s)]
*  Who's going to be the one? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2498.22s)]
*  There's always one. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2501.06s)]
*  Who breaks the seal. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2502.1s)]
*  Yes, always one. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2503.14s)]
*  Who's it gonna be? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2504.38s)]
*  Yeah, they're not gonna ask Joe to write a book. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2505.3s)]
*  Do you imagine that? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2508.22s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, whoa. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2510.5s)]
*  Palm print, palm print, ink, palm print. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2513.34s)]
*  Page turn, ink, palm print. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2518.42s)]
*  Jamie, you never wavered from going after those in power, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2525.06s)]
*  including your ex-wife. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2528.18s)]
*  How do you feel when you see other comics [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2531.54s)]
*  who shied away from that material, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2533.82s)]
*  who now are speaking truth to power? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2536.14s)]
*  I have mixed emotions because I am happy [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2538.94s)]
*  that I feel like they're finally maybe being honest, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2541.1s)]
*  telling the truth, but you know there's so many of them [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2543.66s)]
*  that are grifters and just sort of going [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2545.42s)]
*  where the money is and that's a little infuriating, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2547.5s)]
*  but it's good to have been on board since the beginning. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2549.58s)]
*  And in your mind, like you said, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2551.98s)]
*  like some people's managers and agents [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2552.82s)]
*  like told them not to do certain things and not to, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2554.86s)]
*  I thankfully have a manager who's never told me what to do. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2556.94s)]
*  He doesn't answer my calls. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2559.7400000000002s)]
*  And I lost friends. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2563.54s)]
*  I got divorced from being on the show. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2565.1s)]
*  It was also because she was in love [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2568.34s)]
*  with another man early on. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2569.54s)]
*  Slippery slope. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2573.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's all kind of related. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2574.3s)]
*  And real quick on that video, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2575.78s)]
*  Biden looked like he just found out [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2577.1400000000003s)]
*  he was the best man at a wedding [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2580.7000000000003s)]
*  10 seconds before he had to give a speech. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2582.42s)]
*  He was so unprepared. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2585.9s)]
*  And I think he thinks great grandfather [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2586.9s)]
*  means like a really good grandfather. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2590.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2591.94s)]
*  Yeah, tell that to the stripper baby. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2593.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I think he likes having the word, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2595.5s)]
*  you're forced to have the word. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2596.6600000000003s)]
*  He's not used to having the word great [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2598.7s)]
*  in front of his name, right? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2599.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2600.38s)]
*  He probably likes that. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2601.22s)]
*  You gotta say it, it's part of it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2602.06s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2602.9s)]
*  You know, Kat, I don't think he can outlive, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2603.74s)]
*  well outlive, he's not gonna outlive much, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2607.7s)]
*  but his reputation as having to leave [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2609.74s)]
*  under this cloud of like mental, I don't know, deficiency. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2614.22s)]
*  Or do you wanna talk about comics? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2620.02s)]
*  Yeah, I could talk about comics. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2621.78s)]
*  And with him, it's like, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2624.22s)]
*  what does he have to lose at this point? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2625.18s)]
*  He should have just started showing pictures [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2626.38s)]
*  of the great grandkid, you know what I mean? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2628.02s)]
*  Like, why does he care? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2629.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to talk about it [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2630.78s)]
*  because I think that, I mean, I've also experienced it. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2631.98s)]
*  And I think it's interesting because I'm, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2635.42s)]
*  so I'm not even on either major party. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2637.34s)]
*  But you work at Fox. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2640.02s)]
*  But I work at Fox. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2640.94s)]
*  So that's all that it takes. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2641.78s)]
*  I've straight up had theaters tell me [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2642.6600000000003s)]
*  you cannot have your show here. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2643.94s)]
*  I've straight up had people say, I really like you, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2645.54s)]
*  but I can't have you on my podcast [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2647.42s)]
*  because you work at Fox and what would people say? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2648.86s)]
*  And it is really frustrating, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2652.02s)]
*  but I'm very proud to say that my actual shows, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2654.02s)]
*  I've had both conservatives and liberals [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2658.74s)]
*  get so offended at a joke that they've walked out. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2661.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2663.2599999999998s)]
*  And that makes me really, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2664.74s)]
*  because I've been doing something right [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2666.82s)]
*  if it's not just one side [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2668.46s)]
*  that's been walking out of my shows. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2669.82s)]
*  And I actually, I like Whitney Cummings. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2671.18s)]
*  I like when she spoke about it, she got into more detail. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2673.5s)]
*  She was doing a little bit of self-examination [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2676.82s)]
*  and she was talking a little bit more about it. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2678.58s)]
*  She was saying that about herself. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2679.78s)]
*  She was like, I don't feel like I'm on either side. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2681.2599999999998s)]
*  I have made fun of Trump. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2683.14s)]
*  And the fact that just that I made fun of Democrats, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2684.3399999999997s)]
*  everyone's saying, oh, now I'm red pill, now I'm this. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2687.7s)]
*  It's like, no, everyone should be able [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2690.5s)]
*  to just make fun of everybody. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2692.74s)]
*  And you don't have to just be put into a box [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2694.14s)]
*  because you have one opinion. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2696.18s)]
*  I think that we're, I would love to see us [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2697.14s)]
*  move away from that where we can kind of [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2699.1s)]
*  think for ourselves. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2700.8199999999997s)]
*  But I think it's actually awesome [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2701.7s)]
*  to have people actually admit out loud, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2703.1s)]
*  I was being told I can't make fun of her. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2705.2599999999998s)]
*  Because how embarrassing is that for Kamala? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2707.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2710.06s)]
*  And you still lost. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2710.9s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Tyrus, it's got to, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2714.02s)]
*  it might upset you, you may be passive [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2715.94s)]
*  because you took a big risk at Fox [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2718.1s)]
*  and speaking honestly about your beliefs [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2723.38s)]
*  because you're not supposed to do that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2728.38s)]
*  Wasn't a lot of other black comics [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2730.74s)]
*  on your little picture, was there? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2732.2599999999998s)]
*  There wasn't a lot of other women either. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2733.7s)]
*  Well, there's a reason for that. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2739.02s)]
*  And I have a different opinion. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2740.22s)]
*  Answer, f*** them. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2743.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2743.98s)]
*  F*** them all. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2744.8199999999997s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2745.66s)]
*  Because here's why. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2746.5s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2747.98s)]
*  This wasn't, this wasn't I was told to do. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, you were a willing participant. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2752.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2754.46s)]
*  You jumped in, you took advantage. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2755.2999999999997s)]
*  You took movie deals from guys [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2756.62s)]
*  who were more talented than you. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2758.1s)]
*  My Hollywood career was ripped from me. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2759.18s)]
*  I went from, oh, this dude's funny, he's out the box, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2760.66s)]
*  he's way different than a big guy, blah, blah, blah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2763.22s)]
*  I was on Preacher, I was on like five other shows, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2765.42s)]
*  Love on Netflix, the wrestling thing on, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2768.1s)]
*  all that gone because I chose to be here. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2770.94s)]
*  And I have this weird thing [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2774.1800000000003s)]
*  when you tell me not to do something, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2775.46s)]
*  I get inspired and be like, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2777.26s)]
*  watch, I'll build my own s***, and I did. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2778.54s)]
*  So when I hear them sit there, at least own it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2781.1s)]
*  Have the balls to say, yeah, you know what? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2783.7400000000002s)]
*  I picked the wrong side and now the money's drying up. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2786.3s)]
*  So now I'm gonna make fair, but you went out of your way. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2789.14s)]
*  It wasn't just you told some jokes and chose not to [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2791.38s)]
*  because we all choose certain things [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2794.2200000000003s)]
*  not to make jokes about. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2795.9s)]
*  I don't make jokes about having a lot of kids [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2797.58s)]
*  with different women. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2800.58s)]
*  I choose not to go that route. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2801.42s)]
*  That's my choice. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2803.06s)]
*  They were willing to do it and now all of a sudden [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2805.94s)]
*  they're starting to see, this is what the left always does [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2809.14s)]
*  and people who live with the left, they wanna do it [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2812.46s)]
*  and then when the consequences are coming out, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2814.58s)]
*  all of a sudden, wasn't my fault, I was forced. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2816.54s)]
*  I was an innocent victim. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2819.2599999999998s)]
*  No, you took the checks, you told your manager, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2821.1s)]
*  not only would you do it, you'd do it at a high level. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2822.98s)]
*  Ricky Gervais called it, he said it perfect. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2825.62s)]
*  He said if ISIS would start a movie company, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2827.98s)]
*  you would call your agent and tell them to call them [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2830.38s)]
*  to see if you can get work. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2832.82s)]
*  So when you see them sitting there now, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2833.94s)]
*  and even, what's his name? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2835.46s)]
*  The one who talks like this. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2837.94s)]
*  He was like, it was so important. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2839.54s)]
*  You're missing the, it was so important for them [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2841.86s)]
*  to help influence an election that that's why they did it. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2844.7000000000003s)]
*  It was so important. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2848.1s)]
*  So when I see them, I'm like, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2849.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm a millionaire now because of my standup show. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2850.54s)]
*  So kiss my ass. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2853.38s)]
*  There you go. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2854.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2855.38s)]
*  She couldn't even blink her lashes [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2858.42s)]
*  while her city turned to ash. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om52WuiRgyI&t=2861.46s)]
