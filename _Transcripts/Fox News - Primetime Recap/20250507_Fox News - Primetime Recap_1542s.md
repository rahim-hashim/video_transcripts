# Fox News Highlights - May 6th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE)
*  Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney made a pilgrimage to the White House today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=0.0s)]
*  He got out of the car to shake 47's hand, wave at the cameras, and then plagiarized [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=5.96s)]
*  Trump's fist pump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=10.8s)]
*  From that moment, Trump had him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Our president said, come on in and check out McGold. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=14.52s)]
*  It's an honor to have you at the White House and the Oval Office. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=17.92s)]
*  You see the new and improved Oval Office as it becomes more and more beautiful with love, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=21.18s)]
*  handle it with great love and 24 karat gold. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=27.92s)]
*  That always helps too. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  The best thing Carney has going for him, he's not Trudeau. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=33.4s)]
*  He is a liberal, but he was an underdog who made a stunning comeback to win an election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=36.8s)]
*  Trump respects that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  His party was losing by a lot and he ended up winning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=43.2s)]
*  So I really want to congratulate him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=47.32s)]
*  It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=49.0s)]
*  than mine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Things got off to a good start. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=55.64s)]
*  Another media narrative bites the dust. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=57.36s)]
*  They were hyping it up as a second Zelinsky. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=59.4s)]
*  This is very friendly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=62.56s)]
*  This is not going to be like we had another little blow up with somebody else. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=65.84s)]
*  That was a much different. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=69.12s)]
*  This is a very friendly conversation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=71.24s)]
*  We're friends with Canada and that's good, but sometimes friends have their own agenda. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=73.84s)]
*  We want to make our own cars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=79.5s)]
*  We don't really want cars from Canada. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=80.88s)]
*  And we put tariffs on cars from Canada and at a certain point it won't make economic [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=84.28s)]
*  sense for Canada to build those cars. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=89.72s)]
*  And we don't want steel from Canada because we're making our own steel and we're having [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  massive steel plants being built right now as we speak. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=96.44s)]
*  We really don't want Canadian steel and we don't want Canadian aluminum and various other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=99.8s)]
*  things because we want to be able to do it ourselves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=104.56s)]
*  The president wants to be self-reliant. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=108.0s)]
*  This has been a key characteristic of the American people since the country was founded [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=110.76s)]
*  and the president's sticking to it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Is there anything he can say to you in the course of your meetings with him today that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=116.84s)]
*  would get you to lift tariffs on Canada? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=121.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  Why not? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Just the way it is. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Carney tried to draw his own line in the sand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=128.96s)]
*  He doesn't want to be a governor. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=133.82s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=137.8s)]
*  Canada won right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=138.8s)]
*  You know Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=139.8s)]
*  And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  it's not for sale, it won't be for sale ever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=149.68s)]
*  Canada's our friend, but Trump's taking this relationship to the next level. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=153.84s)]
*  He wants to put a ring on it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  I say never say never. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=160.96s)]
*  I've had many, many things that were not doable and they ended up being doable and only doable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=163.68s)]
*  in a very friendly way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=168.6s)]
*  But if it's to everybody's benefit, you know, Canada loves us and we love Canada. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  That's I think the number one thing that's important. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=175.96s)]
*  It would really be a wonderful marriage because it's two places that get along very well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=178.64s)]
*  They like each other a lot. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=183.12s)]
*  But we begin with good news ahead of the president's important trip to the Middle East and take [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=185.28s)]
*  a look. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=190.72s)]
*  We're going to, as you know, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=191.72s)]
*  We're going to UAE and Qatar. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=195.76s)]
*  And that'll be, I guess, Monday night. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=199.48s)]
*  Some of you are coming with us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=201.84s)]
*  I think before then we're going to have a very, very big announcement to make, like [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=203.4s)]
*  as big as it gets. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=207.64s)]
*  And I won't tell you on what, but it's going to and it's very positive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=209.6s)]
*  I'd also I'd tell you if it was negative or positive. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=213.32s)]
*  I can't keep that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=215.52s)]
*  It is really, really positive. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=217.16s)]
*  And that announcement will be made either Thursday or Friday or Monday before we leave. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=220.24s)]
*  But it'll be one of the most important announcements that have been made in many years about a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=225.84s)]
*  certain subject, very important subject. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=231.44s)]
*  Now this is much more than the looming truce between the U.S. and the Houthi rebels at [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=235.0s)]
*  Yemen that the president announced earlier today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  So pay close attention to the White House this week because big things clearly are in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=243.4s)]
*  the works. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=248.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, this does not apply to Canada. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=249.16s)]
*  Big things are not quite happening there, at least not yet. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=252.44s)]
*  Canada just elected a far left wing prime minister named Mark Carney. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=255.96s)]
*  We will introduce you to Mr. Carney in only a moment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=261.02s)]
*  But first, let's set the stage. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=263.64s)]
*  For months, President Trump has openly and pretty aggressively criticized the government [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=265.3s)]
*  of Canada. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  He frequently called on the country to become our 51st state. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  He mocked their old prime minister, little Justin, as I affectionately refer to him, calling [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=274.24s)]
*  him Governor Trudeau, and even imposed heavy reciprocal tariffs against our neighbors to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=278.84s)]
*  the north. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  And despite all of this, Canada's newly elected prime minister, in many ways, forced to swallow [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  his pride and travel to the White House and meet with the president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  Here's a simple truth to our friends in Canada. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=294.52s)]
*  And as the president did reiterate many times today, they are our friends from Canada. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  They will continue to be our friends. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=303.0s)]
*  Canada absolutely needs the United States for their very survival. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=305.36s)]
*  As the president rightly pointed out, right to Carney's face, we don't really need them [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  for anything. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=314.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=315.56s)]
*  We don't really want cars from Canada. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=316.56s)]
*  And we put tariffs on cars from Canada. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=319.68s)]
*  And at a certain point, it won't make economic sense for Canada to build those cars. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=323.04s)]
*  And we don't want steel from Canada because we're making our own steel and we're having [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=328.56s)]
*  massive steel plants being built right now as we speak. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=332.4s)]
*  We really don't want Canadian steel and we don't want Canadian aluminum and various other [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=335.76s)]
*  things because we want to be able to do it ourselves. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=340.48s)]
*  And there's no reason for us to be subsidizing Canada. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=344.04s)]
*  Canada is a place that will have to be able to take care of itself economically. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=348.08s)]
*  I assume they can. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=354.92s)]
*  We protect Canada militarily and we always will. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  We're not going to, you know, that's not a money thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=359.08s)]
*  But we always will. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=361.6s)]
*  But, you know, it's not fair. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=362.6s)]
*  But why are we subsidizing Canada $200 billion a year or whatever the number might be? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  It's a very substantial number. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=370.68s)]
*  Now President Trump is bluntly telling Canada what they need to hear for years. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  They have sadly ripped us off unfairly. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=377.92s)]
*  They don't make their required payments to NATO. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=381.16s)]
*  They rely on us for their national defense. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=383.36s)]
*  They put restrictions and tariffs and other taxes on America made products while enjoying [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  free access to our markets. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=391.4s)]
*  In fact, almost 100% of their major businesses rely on you, American customers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  They also often use our technology, our medical advancements without adhering to the same [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=400.17999999999995s)]
*  patent laws. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  And yet their leaders have often whined and complained about everything we do while hurting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=406.56s)]
*  our great American businesses, our industries. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=411.59999999999997s)]

*  do on the risk side. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=436.86s)]

*  They keep saying, oh, this is to predict future viruses by creating them. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1147.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, really scary. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1151.6000000000001s)]

*  It's been like what, 100 something days? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1154.92s)]

*  You know, in his first 100 days, all he did was find the coffee machine in the bathroom. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, not in that order. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1165.28s)]

*  I do feel bad, though. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  I did experiment on a dog once. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1173.8600000000001s)]
*  I feel bad. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1175.74s)]
*  But towards the end of my marriage, I knew my ex-wife didn't like me anymore. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1176.74s)]
*  She would drop subtle hints like she'd be like, I don't like you anymore. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1179.26s)]
*  And I'd wake him in the morning and she'd be like, oh, I made you a cup of coffee. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1182.26s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I'm not drinking that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1186.46s)]
*  So I'd give the dog a little sip, make sure he was okay. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1188.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1191.5s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1192.5s)]
*  Then I would drink it if he was good. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1193.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1194.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, that's not a bad experiment. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1195.8600000000001s)]
*  No, it's not at all. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1197.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1198.9s)]
*  That was a sad and tragic tale. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1199.9s)]
*  Paul, I don't know why I pursued that line of questioning with him. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1202.26s)]
*  Are you, what are you most interested in, the dog stuff, the pandemic stuff? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1207.5s)]
*  You have like your fingers and everything. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1212.74s)]
*  You've dealt with illegal immigration as a cop for many years. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1215.26s)]
*  You know, the pandemic thing interests me because the, you know, this is where we're [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1218.9s)]
*  going to hear from all the science people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1222.5s)]
*  You got to believe the science, all about the science, right? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1224.3000000000002s)]
*  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the ostensible purpose of these labs was to make sure we [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1226.74s)]
*  were ready for a big viral outbreak if one comes. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1230.62s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it didn't work. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1234.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1236.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1237.22s)]
*  It happened. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1238.22s)]
*  Like, you know, that was the whole point of them. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1239.22s)]
*  There's three of them in the entire country. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1240.22s)]
*  We funded it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1241.22s)]
*  And the real question is seriously, how is it that Fauci is making that decision? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1242.22s)]
*  How is it that Fauci is the one who said, you know what, we can give tens of millions [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1246.62s)]
*  of dollars to our primary global adversary, China? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1250.78s)]
*  Who decided that that was a good idea? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1255.26s)]
*  Of course it was going to come back and bite us in the ass. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1256.8200000000002s)]
*  And yet, as a reason, what? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1259.38s)]
*  There's no investigation. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1260.9s)]
*  He's got a pension for life. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1262.7s)]
*  He makes an ungodly amount of money. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1263.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1265.26s)]
*  Eight hundred grand. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1266.26s)]
*  He's the highest paid person in government. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1267.26s)]
*  How did he manage that? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1268.26s)]
*  So it seems to me like that's one that you have to talk about. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1269.26s)]
*  Doge, eight hundred thousand dollars to give the Chinese a bioweapon. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1272.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  He there needs to be a commission on the on the Biden cover up and a commission on [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1276.6200000000001s)]
*  covid. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1280.5s)]
*  They did Jan six, which was a one day tantrum. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1281.58s)]
*  This killed a million people. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1286.1799999999998s)]
*  You're familiar with viral outbreaks, Kennedy. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1289.46s)]
*  That's right, Greg. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1292.02s)]
*  I'm covered in microbes. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1294.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1295.9399999999998s)]
*  Thank God this studio isn't lit with black light. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1296.9399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1299.02s)]
*  Anthony Fauci is a horrible person and he was never pressed on this enough. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1300.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1304.3799999999999s)]
*  And there was there was an organization called the White Coat Waste Project. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1310.22s)]
*  And they were the ones who uncovered that there were thousands of dogs that were being [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1311.26s)]
*  given pneumonia. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1314.9s)]
*  They were injected with pneumonia until they bled to death. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1316.98s)]
*  And then they would do experiments on these dogs. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1320.3s)]
*  And we had known about it forever. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1322.18s)]
*  And no one really pressed Fauci on it. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1323.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1325.7s)]
*  They just took him at his word. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1326.7s)]
*  He's like, I'm the science. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1327.7s)]
*  These dogs were asking for it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1329.14s)]
*  You know, first of all, Beagles are very Aryan. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1331.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1335.3s)]
*  And they're disgusting. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1336.3s)]
*  Wear a mask. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1338.7s)]
*  Just just a horrible, vile person. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1339.7s)]
*  And then the mental illness and suicides that followed from the pandemic because he shut [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1343.82s)]
*  down the world. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1349.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is so immoral and authoritarian. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  And I hope to God that history is unkind to him. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1354.46s)]
*  I know that he's been pardoned by Biden. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1357.3s)]
*  But I was talking to a member of Congress that said that now when he goes before Congress [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1360.98s)]
*  because he has been pardoned, he no longer gets to plead the Fifth. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1365.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1369.98s)]
*  He has to answer questions. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1370.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1371.98s)]
*  So his ass should be dragged to the House and Senate every damn day to answer for the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1372.98s)]
*  Beagles and the lockdowns and school closures and church closures and all the rest of it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1377.58s)]
*  I mean, we don't even have time. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1383.1399999999999s)]
*  We don't even have time to look at his role in AIDS. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1386.66s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going back there. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1392.34s)]
*  Okay, if they gave Beagles pneumonia, maybe they should have given Anthony some of the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1394.74s)]
*  things that he was testing on people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1398.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1400.26s)]
*  All right, Tyrus. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1401.26s)]
*  It's funny to me that the party that's so worried about pronouns and what name you're [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1402.66s)]
*  called is okay with making bio weapons. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1408.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1411.34s)]
*  It just seems strange to me that your sticks and stones, that's not a problem. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1412.34s)]
*  It's the names that they're worried about. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1416.86s)]
*  And you always go, what was in it for him to be okay to partner up with China, a place [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1418.26s)]
*  that was notorious for nasty, disgusting labs, untrained people, but yet they put all kinds [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1424.24s)]
*  of money into it to build it up and make it airtight. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1431.3999999999999s)]
*  Even though that was something that was never supposed to be happening. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1435.12s)]
*  So it always goes back to the same thing. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1438.46s)]
*  Who profits from it? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1439.72s)]
*  His $800,000, I'm sure most of that was probably donated and paid taxes on the time because [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1440.9199999999998s)]
*  what he was making on the under is what we need to be thinking about. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1445.4399999999998s)]
*  He didn't make $800,000 to basically have a partnership with a foreign adversary that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1447.76s)]
*  is known for giving. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1453.06s)]
*  I mean, they were given dumbass Hunter Biden diamonds. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1454.06s)]
*  What do you think they were giving him for helping them making bio weapons? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1456.1399999999999s)]
*  It's not gain of fun. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1460.1399999999999s)]
*  It's bio weapons. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1461.18s)]
*  It's worse than mustard gas. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1462.3s)]
*  And that was something that America was supposed to, and the world was supposed to be an agreement [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1463.8s)]
*  like we don't do that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1467.26s)]
*  We don't use those type of things. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1469.06s)]
*  And if you did, you were worse than Hitler. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1470.46s)]
*  But yet here we are making stuff worse than what Hitler had. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1472.98s)]
*  And all the American people weren't, we were all, oh, no one knew. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1476.42s)]
*  And then when it broke out, it was like, oh, you can't ask questions, which again, you [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1479.44s)]
*  have this the last four years. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1484.04s)]
*  That was their time to shine in terms of fleecing this country and doing what they want to do. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  And all the old guard is making money. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's funny now that all of them are getting out. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1493.68s)]
*  All these old senators are suddenly retiring. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1495.9s)]
*  Fauci doesn't want to work anymore. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1497.96s)]
*  They're getting these blanket pardons. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1499.66s)]
*  The Biden family's pardon until like, what, 1812 or something like that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1501.0s)]
*  It's just, we have to stop using these polite words because they never used it with us. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1504.92s)]
*  I was a sellout. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1511.0800000000002s)]
*  You're Hitler. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1512.52s)]
*  You're frugal. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1514.64s)]
*  And think of the bad words they used on me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1515.64s)]
*  They continue to do that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1518.52s)]
*  And then we say things like gain of function and the average person's like, well, I guess [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1519.5600000000002s)]
*  it's not, no, bio weapons at the expense of the American people. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1522.8400000000001s)]
*  And a lot of people don't have grandparents today because of that son of a bitch. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsGIKO2ApE&t=1526.3200000000002s)]
