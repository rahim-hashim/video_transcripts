*  so maybe you wouldn't be too surprised [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=155.46s)]

*  for legacy contamination of coal tar all around the country [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=178.98s)]
*  because it's so toxic and it's so harmful [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=182.62s)]

*  in lockstep on something, but they're pretty close on this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=224.78s)]
*  in terms of their significant concerns, horror even. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=227.86s)]
*  Somebody said to me today, I can't think of any single [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=232.34s)]

*  Their career staff texting me saying this was just [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=238.82s)]

*  of ideology that has no science behind it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=251.3s)]
*  America is the sickest country in the entire developed world [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=254.22s)]

*  This, as Donald Trump just nominated [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=755.2199999999999s)]
*  four more cabinet members. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=757.18s)]
*  He's putting a cabinet together so fast, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=758.9799999999999s)]
*  he's like Jesus with a power tool. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=760.9799999999999s)]
*  Each represents part of the MAGA alliance [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=764.02s)]
*  that either comes off as impressive or downright shocking. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=766.14s)]
*  But that's the nature of the pirate ship. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=769.62s)]
*  You get all sorts, and as long as they're rowing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=772.02s)]
*  in the right direction, they're all aboard. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=774.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump and Biden's meetup at the White House [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=777.38s)]
*  revealed a glee among both of them [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=779.82s)]
*  that even the bitter, wound-licking media couldn't deny. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=782.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think Biden was just happy to spend time with anyone [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=786.3000000000001s)]
*  who isn't trying to put a sheet over his head. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=788.86s)]
*  So why is there such a feeling of optimism? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=792.7800000000001s)]
*  It's the difference between wanting and deciding. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=795.34s)]
*  In 2016, there were things Trump wanted, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=797.94s)]
*  to be the president, to have an impact, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  to move Michelle Obama's weight set to the basement. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=803.42s)]
*  Eight years later, though, the wanting has turned to deciding. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  Not just for him, but for Americans, too. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=811.42s)]
*  Because we've decided it's time for a big change. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=814.0999999999999s)]
*  This should have happened four years ago, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=816.9399999999999s)]
*  but that election was about as secure [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=818.38s)]
*  as the sex swing in Chris Christie's bedroom. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=820.2199999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=825.14s)]
*  It's like the whole country's transitioning, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=827.62s)]
*  except we're getting our balls back. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=830.5s)]
*  Woo! [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=833.9s)]
*  See, we all want stuff, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=840.38s)]
*  but there's a point when you have to decide. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=842.5s)]
*  Yes, I'm gonna make my bed. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=845.18s)]
*  Yes, I'm doing push-ups. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=847.02s)]
*  Yes, I'm finally getting that One Direction tattooed laser [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  off my back. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=851.9799999999999s)]
*  That's selling it on eBay. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=854.26s)]
*  So this was more than just an election, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=856.4599999999999s)]
*  it's a transformational moment. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=858.42s)]
*  Like Jackie Robinson allowed to play Major League Baseball, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=860.74s)]
*  or women being allowed to vote, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=863.82s)]
*  or Ilhan Omar saying, I do, to her brother. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=865.62s)]
*  We decided as a country to move forward, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=870.94s)]
*  and that means no more blaming the people today [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=872.94s)]
*  for the misdeeds of their ancestors. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=875.22s)]
*  That's like arresting my great-grandparents [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=877.82s)]
*  because I'm criminally good-looking. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=879.98s)]
*  The Dems were looking backward [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=887.1s)]
*  while doing things ass-backward, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=888.9s)]
*  and they got dumped like I did with Taylor Swift. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=891.22s)]
*  You would too. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=895.06s)]
*  She snores like Andre the Giant with a sinus infection. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=896.26s)]
*  But so many people are taking this personally [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=900.18s)]
*  as if it's a rejection of their entire way of thinking. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=902.5799999999999s)]
*  Now truly, I want Democrats to feel better. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=905.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm tired of seeing Rachel Maddow weeping at Home Depot. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=907.9s)]
*  And so many in the media are miserable, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=912.6999999999999s)]
*  and imagine being that distraught [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  and not having your own hair to pull out. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  But the only way to get over it [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=921.74s)]
*  is to get out of your own head. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=922.98s)]
*  Forget about identity. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=924.3s)]
*  Embrace the world around you. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=926.2199999999999s)]
*  Family, friends, the people you see [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=927.78s)]
*  as you go about your day. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=930.18s)]
*  Turn anxiety into curiosity. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  Instead of worrying about how tomorrow affects you, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=934.02s)]
*  become curious about how you can affect tomorrow. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=936.6999999999999s)]
*  Research shows that people who dwell on themselves [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=939.38s)]
*  experience more depression, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=942.38s)]
*  but people who turn outward [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=944.3s)]
*  replace that anguish with curiosity. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=945.8599999999999s)]
*  It's why I installed hidden cameras [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=948.42s)]
*  in the Fox and Friends bathroom. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=950.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=951.78s)]
*  See, identity politics is just a fancy word for me. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=953.42s)]
*  What do I want? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=957.8199999999999s)]
*  What hurts my feelings? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=959.3s)]
*  Obsessing over your identity feeds your ego [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=961.0999999999999s)]
*  and starves you of precious connections. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=963.26s)]
*  No wonder a political defeat feels like a wound. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=966.2199999999999s)]
*  But remove identity politics, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=969.2199999999999s)]
*  and the ego shrinks like Rachel Levine's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=970.62s)]
*  nuts in a cold plunge. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=973.06s)]
*  I mean, compare Trump supporters to their opposites. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=976.34s)]
*  RFK, Musk, Tulsi, Rogan, Tucker, Vivek. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=979.34s)]
*  They're all curious, adventurous types [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=983.1s)]
*  with outside interests. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=985.26s)]
*  They surf, falcon, hunt, fly fish, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=987.18s)]
*  leave dead bears in Central Park. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=990.54s)]
*  But they have no time for self-obsession. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=994.9s)]
*  They literally do not think about themselves. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=997.38s)]
*  Unlike the noted Never Trumpers, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1000.9399999999999s)]
*  who have wounded egos tattooed on their foreheads. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1003.7s)]
*  Kinzinger, Cheney, Morning Joe. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1006.58s)]
*  Geraldo's freaking out so bad, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1009.94s)]
*  the state took custody of his mustache. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1011.66s)]
*  Just look at the most unhinged outbursts on cable TV. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1015.98s)]
*  I think there are a lot of families out there [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1019.86s)]
*  who don't believe boys should play girl sports. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1022.14s)]
*  They're not boys. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1025.78s)]
*  I'm not gonna listen to transphobia at this table. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1026.7s)]
*  I am not gonna listen to them call a trans girl a boy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1028.66s)]
*  You're not gonna allow me to finish my explanation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1032.18s)]
*  When you use the words to slur, I'm gonna interrupt. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1034.22s)]
*  That's not how it is. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1036.98s)]
*  They're not boys. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1038.3400000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't give these 13 service members families [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1039.94s)]
*  the time of day. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1043.8200000000002s)]
*  Bulls**t, dude. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1044.66s)]
*  The time of day they would not. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1045.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but Donald Trump hates veterans. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1046.3400000000001s)]
*  He called them suckers and losers. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1050.5400000000002s)]
*  What is wrong with this country [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1053.42s)]
*  that they would choose a message of divisiveness, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1056.0600000000002s)]
*  of xenophobia, of racism, of misogyny [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1059.5s)]
*  over a message of inclusiveness? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1062.7s)]
*  So talk about emotional wounds [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1067.26s)]
*  because our outrage is rooted in identity. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1069.18s)]
*  But we're different. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1072.22s)]

*  How about you? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1138.5800000000002s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1139.42s)]
*  Totally, that you probably need a restraining order. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1140.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, I feel it all over too. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1143.22s)]
*  I feel it everywhere, it's electric. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1144.5400000000002s)]
*  And obviously, maybe it's because we work here at Fox, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1146.06s)]
*  but I feel it everywhere, too. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1147.96s)]
*  I feel it around where I live. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1149.46s)]
*  And I think it's also really palpable, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1150.76s)]
*  the dejection that is based on no actual foundation, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1152.46s)]
*  but only those identity politics that you're talking about [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1156.82s)]
*  because we're here in New York City. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1159.5s)]
*  And the biggest irony to me is there's two things [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1160.8999999999999s)]
*  about their dejection. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1164.46s)]
*  Number one, if they really cared about those identities, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1165.7s)]
*  then wouldn't they see that, number one, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1169.34s)]
*  all of these policies truly lifts all those? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1171.78s)]
*  If they really cared about the plight [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1174.68s)]
*  of the underserved in these communities, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  well then hang on, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  because it's gonna look real good from here on out. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1179.3200000000002s)]
*  And number two, where's the applause and the recognition [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1181.72s)]
*  for, for example, the first female White House Chief [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1184.44s)]
*  of Staff that President Trump just installed, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1186.78s)]
*  for the barriers that he breaks on a daily basis [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1188.98s)]
*  that he never gets any credit for [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1191.68s)]
*  because it's the wrong side. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1192.92s)]
*  And the second thing is that this is their legacy. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1194.24s)]
*  And this is what makes eating this cake taste so good to me, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1196.92s)]
*  that, for example, Nancy Pelosi saying, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1199.88s)]
*  I feel terrible, this was your legacy. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1201.8400000000001s)]
*  This was your fault. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1204.12s)]
*  The reason that the American people rose up [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1205.3999999999999s)]
*  and hit a hat trick and trifecta'd in the Republican Party [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1207.4799999999998s)]
*  is because all of you guys failed. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1211.04s)]
*  You made our seats, our streets terribly unsafe. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1213.32s)]
*  You made people, people died under your watch. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1217.08s)]
*  People lost their livelihoods, they lost their businesses, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1219.4799999999998s)]
*  they lost their scholarships, their hope for a future. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1222.0s)]
*  They lost a lot of things under your watch. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1224.1999999999998s)]
*  So for you to feel terrible, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1225.8s)]
*  you should feel terrible about those things, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1227.04s)]
*  not simply that the wrong side won. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1229.28s)]
*  And the fact that now, you know, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm always ranting and raving about our tax dollars. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1232.12s)]
*  The amount of waste that the bloated administration, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  the weaponization of the regulatory state, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1237.6399999999999s)]
*  the fact that that's all coming to an end, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  I could not be more thrilled. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1242.1999999999998s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1243.6s)]
*  I'm skipping down the sidewalk every day now. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1244.4399999999998s)]
*  That's... [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1247.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  That's great. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1248.76s)]
*  Jim, a lot of people are upset. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1251.76s)]
*  You have to be kind of vindicated [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1253.9599999999998s)]
*  because I've been following you in the last couple of years. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1256.8s)]
*  You take a lot of... [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1259.08s)]
*  Well, you know, it started with the vaccine. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1261.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1266.76s)]
*  Then it started with going after, you know, Biden, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1267.84s)]
*  just the fact that he's been dead since he showed up. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1272.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1276.24s)]
*  I still, to this day, there's no way you can convince me [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1277.08s)]
*  that's the real Joe Biden. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1280.4399999999998s)]
*  That's a remote control or a guy in a mask or what it is. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1282.56s)]
*  It's really nice to know that finally, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1287.8799999999999s)]
*  common sense is allowed to be spoken once again. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1291.24s)]
*  I don't have to go, well, I don't know if like people [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1296.12s)]
*  should be dressing like whores in front of four-year-old kids. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1300.08s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1303.08s)]
*  You're phobic, just going, whoa, whoa. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1305.36s)]
*  I know growing up in Long Island, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1311.04s)]
*  some guys would have banana-hacked in front of the kids. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1313.12s)]
*  We didn't call it education. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1317.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean... [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1318.76s)]
*  I mean... [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1319.6s)]
*  It's so true, because I really do think everybody quietly [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1320.4399999999998s)]
*  was disgusted by so many things, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1327.3999999999999s)]
*  but they couldn't say anything. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1329.1599999999999s)]
*  They couldn't say nothing. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1330.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1331.0s)]
*  So it feels good to just not get nothing to say. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1331.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1334.7199999999998s)]
*  Kat, RFK, what do you say? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1337.7199999999998s)]
*  That just happened a few hours ago [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1340.76s)]
*  when I made a rhyme out of it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1342.08s)]
*  That's how clever I can be. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1343.4399999999998s)]
*  Good one. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1344.6s)]
*  Yeah, people are going crazy about it, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1346.16s)]
*  but actually Obama was, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  we're considering him in 2008 for EPA. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1349.48s)]
*  And also just, I can't with all these people that are like, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1352.2s)]
*  oh, our precious standards of government. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1355.4s)]
*  It's like, what standards are you talking about? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1357.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1360.24s)]
*  I've also fought, like who cares [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1361.16s)]
*  if it got way weirder, quite frankly. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1363.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1365.56s)]
*  If he doesn't get through, why not Marianne Williamson? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1366.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1368.4s)]
*  I mean, okay, like she doesn't have any expertise in health. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but she's 72 and she looks great. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1372.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1374.84s)]
*  So she could be the department of passion. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1376.0s)]
*  She clearly knows something. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1378.12s)]
*  People really are freaking out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  I saw a Vanity Fair headline that called it [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1383.28s)]
*  a brick scary cabinet. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like, hey guys, who's the president right now? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1389.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1392.32s)]
*  Right now. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1394.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  Like we don't really even have a president right now. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1395.8s)]
*  So I really don't, it's not gonna be so easy [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  for me to get wrapped up. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1400.76s)]
*  And I love every single one of these picks. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1402.0s)]
*  No, but who, and? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1404.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1406.56s)]
*  And, like we don't have a president right now. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1407.4s)]
*  You don't, nobody, what is he's not doing anything? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1410.1200000000001s)]
*  I think we're gonna be okay. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1412.24s)]
*  Let's just get weird with it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1413.76s)]
*  Yeah, it goes back to the, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1415.16s)]
*  the analogy of the pirate ship or it feels like, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1420.1200000000001s)]
*  it's like it's an authentic Expendables or Avengers. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1422.64s)]

*  What movie? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1429.2s)]
*  Oh man, this. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1430.1200000000001s)]
*  The Dirty Dozen? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1432.0800000000002s)]

*  This is a war is about to, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1434.72s)]
*  let's hold off on the soiree and the bardian. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1436.96s)]
*  Because he's going to attempt to drain the swamp [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1440.0s)]

*  and being able to cousins and first cousins [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1464.6399999999999s)]
*  and lobbyist sons getting jobs and places [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1468.04s)]
*  and being pushed to be in charge of energy [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1471.28s)]
*  in China or Ukraine. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1473.72s)]
*  All of that's gonna come to an end. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1475.72s)]
*  And you think they're just gonna be like, okay. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1477.8s)]
*  So it's going to be, if he's picking these people, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1481.12s)]
*  every one of them has an ax to grind. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's a reason for that because this is going to be [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1487.08s)]
*  the fight for the American. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  It's one thing to get in, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1491.76s)]
*  it's another thing to actually make change. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  He's got the house, he's got the Senate. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1495.4399999999998s)]
*  So all this is great and we're all fired up. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1498.04s)]
*  But if he walks in there and doesn't do term limits [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1500.1999999999998s)]
*  in that first week, because that's how you stop all this stuff. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1502.4399999999998s)]
*  That's how you stop the career. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1505.32s)]
*  You got to hit the term limits and then you unleash the dogs. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1506.6s)]
*  And then you find out how much money they've been stealing [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1509.28s)]
*  from the American people. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1511.1999999999998s)]
*  Eventually the people who donated to the Democratic Party [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1512.4799999999998s)]
*  to raise it up to a billion dollars minus 20 [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  are gonna be like, they're gonna find out [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1518.72s)]
*  that they were being conned by the government, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1520.76s)]
*  by the progressive government. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1522.72s)]
*  So that's not, they're just gonna lay down and take it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1524.16s)]
*  It's gonna be terrible. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1526.3600000000001s)]
*  Pelosi's sad today because she's trying to figure out [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1527.88s)]
*  who she's gonna take out first, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1530.52s)]
*  who they're gonna come after first. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1532.16s)]
*  So he's smart in picking guys like Gates and guys [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1533.64s)]
*  because they're already flawed [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1536.28s)]
*  and they already have their issues, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1538.24s)]
*  but he's coming for your job. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1539.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's the Oakland. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1540.56s)]
*  So it's game on, but be alert. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1541.4s)]
*  It's the 1977 Oakland Raiders. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1543.96s)]
*  Yes! [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6bqg-dsDI4&t=1547.68s)]
