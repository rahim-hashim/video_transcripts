# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 5, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle. Thank you, as always, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=0.0s)]
*  for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=8.36s)]
*  All right. With today's executive order, Donald Trump has officially cemented his place in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=9.36s)]
*  history as the most pro-female president ever. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  The war on women's sports is over. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=17.6s)]
*  As trans lunatics are frenzied in defeat, we're going to talk to one of the winners [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=25.6s)]
*  in this battle. And as for Trump's bombshell Gaza proposal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=29.58s)]
*  President is willing to think outside the box, look for new and unique, dynamic ways [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=34.22s)]
*  to solve problems that have felt like they're intractable. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=39.54s)]
*  Middle East leaders say they were caught off guard, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=44.7s)]
*  he's here to tell us more. And what really has liberals fuming? That their taxpayer-supported [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  slush funds are being zeroed out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=55.26s)]
*  We will not shut up. We will stand up. We will speak up. We will rise up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=57.82s)]
*  But have Dems found their resistance legs? And that brings us to Trump waste removal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=67.26s)]
*  services. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  You ever seen what happens when addicts can't find their fix? Well, it's pretty ugly. They'll [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=76.38s)]
*  do and say almost anything to get their drugs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=85.76s)]
*  Listen, I need you to help me out, all right? I need you to give me some money, okay? I [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=88.64s)]
*  need you to give me like $5, like $20, something like that, because I'm in some trouble. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, official Washington has been addicted to spending for decades. And look, they use [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  our money for their own pleasure trips and they expect no consequences. Typical addicts, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=111.48s)]
*  no accountability. And when their supply is threatened, they rant, rave and babble. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Foreign aid isn't popular with the public. They don't know how much we spend on it. Well, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=123.0s)]
*  I say to that b****, that is where we have to make a stand, because without that, we [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=127.68s)]
*  have no country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=136.8s)]
*  We have no country without what exactly? Without the types of projects that USAID funds that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=139.12s)]
*  are totally unrelated to this president's priorities? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=146.32s)]
*  USAID awarded $2 million to strengthen trans led organizations to deliver gender affirming [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=149.16s)]
*  health care in Guatemala. USAID awarded $1.5 million for providing a gender sensitive response [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  to migration at the Venezuelan border. USAID awarded $4.3 million on October 1, 2023 to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=164.28s)]
*  a group to fund comprehensive health services for men having sex with other men in South [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=170.72s)]
*  Africa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=176.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, these folks are junkies, not Nancy Mace. The people want to spend the money. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=177.16s)]
*  Because without taxpayer money to waste, they turn into these complete sputtering fools. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=184.0s)]
*  They can't heal their own party, but they claim to be able to heal the world? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=188.92s)]
*  The Republicans, they are losing when they attack our healers. Our healers have been [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  stranded all over the globe. USAID has kept the peace in the globe. We are not colonizers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=200.72s)]
*  We are supposed to be a democracy. We honestly must ask this party to reevaluate its own [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=209.88s)]
*  relationship with God. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Her party, which fights for partial birth abortion and trans surgeries for minors, is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=221.8s)]
*  going to accuse others of being godless for not blowing billions on climate and gender [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=227.56s)]
*  boondoggles? Nice try. The definition of incoherent, a political movement that obsessed on this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=232.72s)]
*  We have to calm the rhetoric down. We have to make sure that we treat each other with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=241.68s)]
*  respect and condemn the violence whenever it occurs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=247.48s)]
*  He has increased his violent rhetoric. Donald Trump has about political opponents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=252.8s)]
*  But now the party's sounding like this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=260.56s)]
*  Let me tell you something, Mr. Trump, you and your little friend off of Twitter, you're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=263.28s)]
*  about to find out. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=269.08s)]
*  We are here to fight back. We have got to tell Elon Musk, nobody elected your ass. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=270.44s)]
*  We have to fight this in the courts. We have to fight this in the Congress. We have to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=279.64s)]
*  fight this in the streets. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=284.64s)]
*  Shut down the Senate. We are at war. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  For decades, many of us have complained about the do nothing Republicans, that every election [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=293.44s)]
*  season they promised to starve the beast. They bemoan the rise of the bureaucratic state. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=298.56s)]
*  They pledged to bring transparency to Washington. Wouldn't that be great? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=304.4s)]
*  But year after year, government spending only increased. Wack job programs kept getting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=308.56s)]
*  funded and the slush machine kept turning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=313.4s)]
*  But Trump 47 is changing all that. Having learned some pretty tough lessons from his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=317.56s)]
*  first term, President Trump knows he has no time to waste if he really wants to slash [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=322.2s)]
*  government waste. And he knew this would require unconventional thinking from someone [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=327.52s)]
*  who, like himself, is used to defying the critics. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk's blitz through the federal government and its spending has put official Washington [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  and its toadies on defense. They're scrambling now for an effective response. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  NBC is warning that Elon Musk and Doge are hacking the government with lightning speed, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=350.12s)]
*  no less. Only DC, by the way, would actually say that an effort to save taxpayer money [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=355.48s)]
*  where staff are working 120 hours a week, that's somehow called hacking to them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  Now this piece unwittingly is hilarious because we're supposed to be frantic because his team [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=370.36s)]
*  of really smart people is there pouring over office building leases, spending contracts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=374.8s)]
*  and employee performance with the stated intention of radical downsizing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=380.96s)]
*  You mean in all this free time between managing SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk is doing what [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=387.76s)]
*  President Trump committed to doing on the campaign trail? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=392.68s)]
*  He called it the Department of Government Efficiency for a reason. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  Although it is a humorous name, ironically, I think Doge will have a very serious and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=400.67999999999995s)]
*  significant impact on government waste and and foreign abuse, which is really astonishing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=408.16s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars, maybe as much as a trillion down a rat hole in DC every [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=417.16s)]
*  year. And now the Doge team is considering the elimination of entire departments and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  agencies that are not going to have any negative impact on the average American. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  Now earlier this week, we exposed the corruptocrats at USAID, but again, that's just the tip of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=433.78s)]
*  the bureaucracy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=439.34s)]
*  But will Trump really do what President Reagan once floated doing? Will he shutter the failed [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=441.73999999999995s)]
*  Department of Education? Sure sounds like it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  We're ranked number one in cost per pupil. So we spend more per pupil than any other [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=451.14s)]
*  country in the world. And we're ranked at the bottom of the list. We're ranked very [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=455.02s)]
*  badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=458.73999999999995s)]
*  This is making those who benefit ideologically or financially from a perpetually unaccountable [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=463.7s)]
*  bureaucracy very agitated, even very belligerent. They're becoming Musk is their new public [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=470.38s)]
*  enemy. Number one. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=477.29999999999995s)]
*  This dude is probably one of the most unintelligent billionaires I have ever met or seen or witnessed, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  which, you know, you can probably even glean that from watching these people on TV. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=489.62s)]
*  Anyways, all of that is to say is that they don't do their homework. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=494.38s)]
*  Anyways. Now, imagine being AOC and trying to convince voters that she's smarter than [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=500.34s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=509.66s)]
*  Now, nevertheless, the squad is fanning out, trying to stretch its clipped wings. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=513.7s)]
*  Note what happens when these brainiacs are asked simple questions. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  There are Americans who want the money that America spends abroad to be spent at home [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=522.66s)]
*  instead. Can you explain to those people why you think they should be interested in helping [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=527.5799999999999s)]
*  families like yours? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=533.2199999999999s)]
*  I think what is really important for the American people to understand is that this money [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=534.5s)]
*  really amounts to less than one percent of what our budget is as a country. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  It is money that goes to the most vulnerable around the world. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=545.5s)]
*  How arrogant can she be? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's just tens of dollars, tens of billions of dollars. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=553.26s)]
*  No biggie. No wonder America is in such massive debt. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=556.18s)]
*  Now, New York's senior senator was no more convincing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=560.74s)]
*  Doge is operating in many ways like a shadow government. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=564.42s)]
*  The American people will not stand for an unelected secret group [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=568.26s)]
*  to run rampant through the executive branch. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=574.4599999999999s)]
*  Being innovative is good. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=578.4599999999999s)]
*  But, Mr. Musk, this isn't a tech startup. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=581.3s)]
*  These are public institutions. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=584.7399999999999s)]
*  Now, we're supposed to believe that Chuck Schumer is now against unelected [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=587.5s)]
*  power. That's precisely what the bureaucratic state is. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=594.06s)]
*  It's what Musk wants to put it into. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=597.62s)]
*  Yeah, all those independent agencies that run around like the people elected them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=600.02s)]
*  OPM, CFPB, the USAID, outright without any oversight and waste money that Congress [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=603.54s)]
*  never specifically authorized. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=610.62s)]

*  They even tried that today on the Hill. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=629.5s)]
*  Who is this unelected billionaire that he can attempt to dismantle federal agencies, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=631.98s)]
*  fire people, transfer them, offer them early retirement and have sweeping reform [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=639.26s)]

*  Elon Musk to come before it as a witness at the earliest possible moment. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=654.42s)]
*  Democrats are itching to get back into power. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=659.42s)]
*  Why? To serve you? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=663.02s)]
*  No, they want to launch more investigations. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=664.9s)]
*  Yeah, reweaponize the government and they'll do it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=667.78s)]
*  They will try to bankrupt all of the Doge staffers. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=670.58s)]
*  They probably couldn't do it to Musk. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=674.7s)]
*  But look, if they could put him in jail, I have no doubt they would. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=676.62s)]

*  The bureaucrats or the people? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=693.46s)]
*  Trump, Vance and the Doge team believe that you should govern the country through [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=696.66s)]

*  Forty three million dollars on a gas station in Afghanistan that had no [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=867.74s)]
*  customers. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=871.38s)]
*  Still less though than what Biden paid for a charging station here. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=872.98s)]
*  One and a half million to promote gays lesbians and trans in Jamaica. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=876.86s)]
*  Jamaican me crazy. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=881.42s)]

*  That's just how it was described. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=895.38s)]
*  Seventeen million to promote inclusion in Vietnam. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=897.58s)]
*  It's just probably another way of saying it went to trans. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=901.02s)]
*  We carpet bond them and then we paid them the cross dress. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=904.78s)]
*  Twenty five million to promote green transportation in Georgia. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=908.66s)]
*  Not the state the country. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=912.54s)]
*  And it's not like we took the money and bought them electric cars. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  We just paid a shady agency to put up a billboard that says buy electric cars. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=917.42s)]
*  A million for Arab and Jewish photographers. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  Are you Jewish. Are you Arab. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=927.14s)]
*  Do you have cameras. Here's a check. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=928.62s)]
*  Eight million dollars to teach Sri Lankan journalists how to avoid binary gendered language. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=931.66s)]
*  Translation. We spent eight million so that a reporter in Sri Lanka doesn't write he or she. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=937.62s)]
*  Well at least nobody died right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=944.06s)]
*  Wrong. A hundred and twenty two million of the USAID money was given to terrorists. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=946.74s)]
*  The Taliban is taxpayer funded. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=952.66s)]
*  So was the Wuhan lab. So we're on a roll. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=955.42s)]
*  The people spending the money can't even tell you why they're spending the money. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=958.58s)]
*  USAID awarded two million dollars to strengthen trans led organizations to deliver gender affirming health care in Guatemala. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=963.58s)]
*  So to each of you this morning. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=972.3000000000001s)]
*  Does this advance the interests of American citizens paying for trannies in Guatemala to the tune of two million dollars. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=973.74s)]
*  Yes or no. Governor. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=980.7s)]
*  I have no position. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=984.82s)]
*  Of course you don't. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=986.3000000000001s)]
*  Two million dollars for sex changes in Guatemala. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=988.0600000000001s)]
*  Despite the blatant waste and corruption there's a sinister side to all of the gay lesbian and trans money we're funneling into other countries. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=991.58s)]
*  It's subversive. It undermines their traditional culture their religions and their governing authority. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=998.6600000000001s)]
*  It divides these countries. It distracts them and makes it easier for our government to exploit them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1004.6600000000001s)]
*  David Axelrod told Democrats who are defending this stuff. You're walking into a trap. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1011.1800000000001s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel says you don't have to fight every fight. Wasteful spending isn't the hill I'm going to die on. But trans operas in Colombia are the hill Democrats have chosen to die on. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1017.02s)]
*  Are they getting kickbacks. We're about to find out. Democrats warn Trump's unelected shadow government is dismantling their unelected shadow government. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1028.46s)]
*  It's how the Babylon B puts it. Democrats have been sending your tax dollars to the World Economic Forum so they can tell us to eat bugs. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1038.94s)]
*  The George Soros Prosecutor Fund got 26 million dollars of your money to what open jails USAID brags about overthrowing governments. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1048.2600000000002s)]
*  They bragged about supporting military coups and color revolutions in the Middle East Asia and Ukraine. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1059.74s)]
*  And we just found out the Biden administration was paying the press during the last four years. Politico received 26 million dollars from the federal government. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1066.74s)]
*  Eight million dollars just last year. The Biden administration was paying a DC insider publication that happened to never report anything bad about the Biden administration. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1079.22s)]
*  But what did they pay for besides good press. The government says it was for subscriptions to Politico Pro. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1090.46s)]
*  Well what's Politico Pro supposed to give you inside scoops or exclusive reporting about the federal government. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1099.66s)]
*  It's been around since 2010 but all of a sudden in 2021 the Biden administration starts buying hundreds of Politico Pro subscriptions. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1108.06s)]
*  And a subscription runs anywhere from 10,000 to seventy five thousand dollars a year. Those are like top tier country club dues for seventy five thousand dollars. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1117.78s)]
*  This exclusive reporting must be pretty good right now. No one ever read in Politico Pro that Biden was brain dead. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1129.6999999999998s)]
*  Now if I'm going to pay seventy five grand for journalism I want to know whose coke was in the White House. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1138.02s)]
*  Politico Pro isn't even for people in government it's for lobbyists. You pay seventy five grand a year for the name and email address of a regulator at the FDA. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1144.26s)]
*  So you can email him wine and dine him at Cafe Milano and then grease the regs for Pfizer or craft or whoever your client is. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1155.7s)]
*  You find out when the farm bills about the past so you can send your lobbyists into the back room and write the bill. It's not for people in the government. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1164.18s)]
*  What do people at the Department of Energy need to pay seventy five grand for to find out what's going on in the Department of Energy. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1172.46s)]
*  Mayorkas needs to know what's going on with the border bill. All he has to do is call Chuck Schumer. The phone calls free. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1181.3400000000001s)]
*  This doesn't make any sense. The whole thing is a racket. This was a bailout. Biden's government didn't need this. It's a payoff product. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1188.26s)]
*  Because when they started paying Politico they tanked the laptop. They covered up Biden's nap times. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1199.7s)]
*  The USAID chief Samantha Power Politico wrote a puff piece about her called her a celebrity. Have you ever heard of celebrity Samantha Power. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1207.5s)]
*  Politico didn't get paid to do journalism. They got paid to stop doing journalism. Now I read Politico. I read it every day. I like it. It's got good reporting in [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1218.82s)]
*  there. But I'm not funneling twenty six million dollars of taxpayer money over there in exchange for good coverage. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1228.78s)]
*  I'm sure a few people with the federal government have Wall Street Journal subscriptions for fifty nine dollars a year. Not seventy five [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1236.1399999999999s)]
*  thousand. And if you're trying to save a few dollars share your password and logins with your staff you don't get them all. Seventy five [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1244.1399999999999s)]
*  thousand dollar a year subscriptions. Primetime reached out to Politico and we didn't hear back. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1251.3799999999999s)]
*  The White House says the government paying journalists. That's getting doged. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1257.74s)]
*  So upon coming out here to the briefing room I was made aware of the funding from USAID to media outlets including Politico who I know has a seat in [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1264.42s)]
*  this room. And I can confirm that the more than eight million taxpayer dollars that have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1275.14s)]
*  Politico on the American taxpayers dime will no longer be happening. The Doge team is working on canceling those payments now. How critical is [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1283.1399999999999s)]
*  government funding to Politico's bottom line. Not sure. But on the day of the freeze they couldn't make payroll for a couple hours. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1290.82s)]
*  It's not just Politico. The New York Times got millions. BBC got money. PolitiFact was funded by the Biden administration. Biden was [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1299.58s)]
*  censoring you and funding independent fact checkers to call you a liar. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1309.22s)]
*  Kamala took your money and paid Sharpton. Biden took your money gave it to Politico gave it to donors to build solar panels. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1314.78s)]
*  The left somehow looks like one big astroturf to money laundering shell game. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1323.18s)]
*  Remember the CIA has a history of planning scoops with journalists. Disseminate propaganda to influence people's minds. And this is a [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1329.06s)]
*  major function of the CIA. You have contact with a journalist. You will give him true stories. You'll get information from him. You'll also [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1338.54s)]
*  give him false stories. You also work on their human vulnerabilities to recruit them in a classic sense to make them your agent so that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1346.66s)]
*  you can control what they do. 400 journalists cooperating with the CIA including some of the biggest names in the business to [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1355.58s)]
*  consciously introduce the stories into the press. Journalists were on CIA payrolls. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1364.1s)]
*  Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to a major circulation. American Journal. We do have people who [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1371.86s)]
*  submit pieces to other two American journals. So if intelligence agencies which is kind of what the USAID is is financing the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1389.06s)]
*  American media that state run media and if Kamala would have won the election the money would have kept flowing. Politico must have [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1398.8999999999999s)]
*  known that they wrote puff pieces about how fantastic she was. I wonder if that was connected. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1406.74s)]
*  Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Trump got elected and caught him. We're only in week three. Who else is getting paid. But first [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1412.74s)]
*  let's check in on the Democratic Party shall we. Which is now move. First they were in the denial stage after the election. They [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1422.1s)]
*  couldn't believe they lost. And they were in the grief and depression stage. Now they have officially entered the the rage and anger [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1428.58s)]
*  stage which is where they usually are with President Trump. Not much of a change which by the way I'm perfectly fine with if that's [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1437.26s)]
*  where they want to be. And I hate to break it to our friends in the radical new left wing socialized Democratic Party. But they [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1444.42s)]
*  they're they're screaming into a void at this point. Same with their their allies and co-workers in the state run legacy media mob. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1453.38s)]
*  They lost the election. Their approval numbers are nearing record lows and yet they continue to fight two losing battles. The first [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1461.3s)]
*  one is over illegal immigration outside of a tiny group of Democrats. Almost everyone in America wants Donald Trump to deport [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1467.98s)]
*  illegal immigrants. Those that are murderers rapists gang members cartel members known terrorists in our country. They're the only [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1475.66s)]

*  The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It's right now a demolition site. This is just a [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1695.5800000000002s)]
*  demolition site. Virtually every building is down. They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious. They [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1704.7s)]

*  Like Trump's terror threats and tough negotiations with Panama Venezuela Denmark Mexico Canada. This is likely just the first chapter [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1732.06s)]
*  in a complex ongoing art of the deal negotiation. But once again for the million time the Democratic Party has just overcome with [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1742.26s)]
*  hysteria. You decide. I think it's the craziest idea I've ever heard in my life. Two million people living in Gaza. A problem that Israel [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1750.06s)]
*  has. And now we're going to have. We want to own Gaza. You've got something like two million Gazans there. More than half of them do not [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1758.74s)]
*  support Hamas right now. But the moment you tell them that you've got to leave because of a U.S. plan backed by Israel every single one will [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1766.94s)]
*  join Hamas and fight. We have known that this is Trump's plan for the Gaza Strip. It is the definition of ethnic cleansing. It is part of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1774.34s)]
*  the culmination of what I view to be genocide of Palestinian people. It's delusional. It's also dangerous and it is disgustingly insensitive [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1785.02s)]
*  to Palestinian humanity. Clearly there is now it's an official foreign policy of the United States. The illegal occupation of a [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1795.54s)]
*  sovereign land ethnic cleansing which constitute both on both counts are crimes against humanity. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=1804.26s)]

*  instructions. If they do it they get obliterated. There won't be anything left. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2203.46s)]
*  Not. Not a bad plan. You know I also left instructions in case I'm assassinated. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2211.38s)]
*  That my ashes are to be spread on top of kill me lunch. Look the point is Trump doesn't just think outside the box. He leaves the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2222.34s)]
*  box on the curb for Don Lemon to sleep in. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2231.7799999999997s)]
*  And because everything follows a simple principle America first no bluffs given. It all makes sense. And there's less wiggle room [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2237.06s)]
*  than Joy Behar Spanx. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2243.8599999999997s)]
*  Compare that to the old administration and activists wish list far removed from Americans real concerns. Trans issues sanctuary [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2248.2599999999998s)]

*  It all translated to America last. So now Trump's crushing it. On Tuesday the CIA offered buyouts to its entire workforce [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2262.06s)]
*  which he'd just done to millions of federal workers. The upside their disguise skills will come in handy if you don't want [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2271.5s)]

*  And he's also withdrawing the US from the UN Human Rights Council. Who's on that council. Well Burundi China Somalia [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  Sudan having those countries on a council on human rights is like having J.B. Pritzker on the board at Weight Watchers. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2306.22s)]
*  Yeah. Trump also signed another order banning men from women's sports. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2317.2999999999997s)]

*  Nadler just used their only bathroom. Since the education department's inception reading and math scores have been dropping [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2358.42s)]

*  Munster. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2400.38s)]

*  he comes. They mutter world leaders scramble for selfies. Politicians come to kiss his ring. And no wonder he's a cross between [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2413.82s)]
*  Godzilla and the Energizer bunny. And when you're a legend the story around you does almost all the work for you especially when [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2421.54s)]
*  the story has a happy ending. As long as you do what daddy said. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2431.02s)]

*  And she's still a distraction despite her contractions. New York Times best selling author of Fox News. Get Dremm and her cat Jim. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2468.7400000000002s)]
*  Tom what do you make of this whole Gaza thing. It's like we're not putting troops on the ground but he seems to have just hijacked [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2474.54s)]
*  the conversation made people think past the sale that he's actually in charge. And somebody better use somebody better do something. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2488.62s)]
*  I'm going to just build something. That's what it is. And when he announced it at the press conference I almost thought he was just [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2497.94s)]
*  making it up on the spot. And then they went over to BB Net and Yahoo and I thought he was going to be like what are you talking [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2502.7799999999997s)]
*  about. But he was like I think it's a great idea. Unbelievable. But the you know I love that you know the reporter the Afghan [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2507.1s)]
*  reporter and after he said I didn't understand a word you said I love the way he wrapped it up instead of saying could you repeat [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2515.5s)]
*  the question. He said good luck live in peace. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2523.14s)]
*  The best answer. Just move on. You know I don't even know what. I cannot keep up with this presidency. I mean it's only a couple of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2529.14s)]
*  weeks in. I feel like it's you know that movie the Keanu Reeves movie where he's driving the bus and he can't stop driving. Yes. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2536.7s)]
*  That's what the presidency is. And the Democrats are the villain. And they're like if you stop the bus everyone will die. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2543.62s)]
*  Trump's like that's fine. Plowing through everything. They don't know what to do. The article you sent me today the New York Times [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2549.2599999999998s)]
*  article. They are they're all freaking out. It's written by all the Maggie Haberman and everybody else. They have so many people [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2557.2599999999998s)]
*  on the masthead. And it's said that you know in part by Mr. Trump Mr. Musk is waging a largely unchecked war against the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2562.4599999999996s)]
*  federal bureaucracy. And I'm like that's the bad part. You know it's like they don't know what to do. I just can't believe that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2569.18s)]
*  you couldn't remember the name of the movie Speed. That's like saying like what's that Scorsese movie about wise guys. Oh you [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2578.7799999999997s)]
*  mean good fellows. No it's about the wise guy. The heroes in it. What's that movie about Rocky Balboa. What's it called. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2588.62s)]
*  You're a screwed up guy. Julie. You know Tom makes a really good point that like we can't keep up with him but maybe that's how [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2598.74s)]
*  gets done these days. Do you find it arousing. I do. Yes. Yeah. No I'm so turned on right now. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2609.8999999999996s)]
*  But you ended your monologue with a happy ending and then you had my mind. No I think he's doing a lot of great things and I [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2619.1s)]
*  think he's living up to all his promises which I don't remember the last time that we had a president ever actually not even in his [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2626.98s)]
*  first term move this quickly in a matter of two weeks. I just want to talk about women and women's sports transgender women not [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2632.48s)]
*  being allowed or men biological male whatever you want to call that that group did not have to compete in women's sports. I [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2640.3s)]
*  think that's excellent. And that is something that this country really needed. I mean it's just been it's been so unfair. I'm a [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2648.1s)]
*  little bummed about it because I personally was looking forward to trying out for the women's team break dancing for the next [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2652.86s)]
*  year. But now I'm not going to qualify because as you know yes. Apple have you noticed it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2658.9s)]
*  I was not aware. I was not aware. All right. Loftus are you upset that you're now banned from competing in women's sports. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2668.1800000000003s)]
*  I got to come up with a plan B. Yes it was that I was going to do the break dancing thing but now that's off the table. I am loving [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2677.02s)]
*  every single moment of this presidency. It's like Christmas every day. Yes it's like all we asked Santa for even for Jews. Right. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2687.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like all we asked for was a wall. Yeah. Right. And Trump keeps going. No check under the tree. I think there's one more under [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2697.98s)]
*  there. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2712.02s)]
*  The Gulf of America. How did you know. Under the tree. There's one more. The Gaza Strip. Oh my God. It's a great idea. It's going to be [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2712.18s)]
*  awesome. But we got to rename it right. Something confusing like Mississippi North. Just just so no one really understands where we're [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2726.5s)]
*  going. But you'll have to throw a stand on the end of it like Mississippi North a stand so we can embrace the local culture. What about [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2735.62s)]
*  M.A. to Gaza. OK. But Maggaz a Maggaz a Gaza Maggaz a stand Gaza stand. You get. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2745.58s)]
*  My. Now you've got like a homeless problem in L.A. or Mississippi or Alabama. Lift them up. Drop them off there. They can open up a [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2757.02s)]
*  love's truck stop. They can work at the Gaza Strip. We'll have that place rocking and rolling by midnight. Baby. See. Cat. It's like he's [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2766.3s)]
*  oh he's opened this conversation up into a whole new world. I don't think it's going to lead to us moving and occupying there. But he's I [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2776.78s)]
*  feel like he just he forced everybody's hand. I don't think it will either. Although I'm sure he misses building things and his nation building [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2786.1s)]
*  would probably be prettier than George W. But yeah I mean I'm very much a huge non interventionist. Right. I don't want American tax dollars [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2793.38s)]
*  spent on this stuff. I want boots on the ground. I also lived through four years of Trump before. Yeah. And I think that what I used to do I [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2801.46s)]
*  think he just throws stuff out there sometimes. And I think what I maybe did more than once in the last Trump term is I would then react [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2808.62s)]
*  based on that thing. And a lot of times you let time go on. You're like oh this isn't going to happen or is this for some other reason. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2815.94s)]
*  Because now he's saying he also doesn't want boots on the ground. He also doesn't want American tax dollars spent over there. Now how it works [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2823.02s)]
*  without those two things. I don't think it does. But he didn't start this conversation. I remind you of the North Korea thing where the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2830.18s)]
*  thing we were trying to solve was their desire to drop a missile on us. And so he says you know we could build something here. And that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2838.06s)]
*  didn't happen. But what did happen is he removed the threat of the table. He's like we'll build it. But he did get the threat removed [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2844.82s)]
*  from the table. And that was like the first thing he did. And people forget about that. But I won't forget it. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCVx6D-r6Sc&t=2852.2599999999998s)]
