# Fox News Highlights - May 5th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs)
*  Meet the unimpressed. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the liberals like to say that Donald Trump has no respect for norms, as they call them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=6.0s)]
*  And they think an exchange between President Trump and NBC's Kristen Welker confirms their point. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=11.0s)]
*  You said in a recent interview you could bring him back, but you won't. Are you defying the Supreme Court? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=17.0s)]
*  No, I'm relying on the Attorney General of the United States, Pam Bond, who's very capable, doing a great job. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=24.0s)]
*  Because I'm not involved in the legality or the illegality. I have lawyers to do that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=30.0s)]
*  And that's why I have a great DOJ. They're not viewing the decision the way you said it. They don't view it that way at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=36.0s)]
*  They think it's a totally different decision. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=44.0s)]
*  One hundred percent. Look, he's not a lawyer, but he has lawyers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=46.0s)]
*  And they believe they're following what the Supreme Court is directing. The legal team is working this through. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=50.0s)]
*  Ben Welker and everyone at NBC thought they had him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=56.0s)]
*  But when you listen to the clip, he says, no, he is not defying the court. But she doesn't accept that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=60.0s)]
*  She keeps interrupting and pushing for the answer she wants, that Trump is somehow trying to create a constitutional crisis. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=66.0s)]
*  Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=72.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=78.0s)]
*  Well, the Fifth Amendment sets us up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=82.0s)]
*  I don't know. It seems it might say that. But if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or two million or three million trials. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=84.0s)]
*  Now, let me translate for all of you out there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=92.0s)]
*  Donald Trump answered, I don't know, to her interpretation of the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=95.0s)]
*  He was responding to her. It would have been absurd for Trump to have accepted his gospel, Welker's view of the Fifth Amendment, and illegals. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=102.0s)]
*  Why should you think that a hostile reporter without a law degree, by the way, is framing anything fairly? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=110.0s)]
*  And as usual, his instinct was right about her and the question. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=116.0s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States, Mr. President? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=121.0s)]
*  I don't know. I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=124.0s)]
*  What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=135.0s)]
*  Asked and answered. He said, I have brilliant lawyers and they're going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=140.0s)]
*  That good enough for them? Of course, the headlines and the banners across multiple networks all day long, all yesterday, took this as Trump saying he doesn't know whether he'll follow the Constitution. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=148.0s)]
*  Donald Trump kind of playing fast and loose with what the Constitution and the Supreme Court require him to do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=159.0s)]
*  This is really a scary moment. He's already demonstrated his willingness to disobey court orders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=166.0s)]
*  President Trump has also raised eyebrows for casting doubt about his responsibility to uphold the Constitution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=172.0s)]
*  Raised eyeballs. Now, after watching these media types closely for far too long, frankly, watching their feigned and farcical outrage over Trump, the only question to ask is, are there any serious journalists left at these networks? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=177.0s)]
*  Because from these interviews, it seems they are clearly not interested in learning anything. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=194.0s)]
*  They're only interested in presenting their narrative and getting to an aha moment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=201.0s)]
*  I think a tariff is going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=207.0s)]
*  But you said some dolls are going to cost more. Isn't that an acknowledgement that some prices will go up? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=210.0s)]
*  I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=214.0s)]
*  I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=222.0s)]
*  We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=228.0s)]
*  We don't have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don't need. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=233.0s)]
*  Remember when the media used to be against materialism? Now they're for it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=239.0s)]
*  Well, and from all this, NBC hopes that Americans conclude en masse that Trump's a billionaire trying to steal Christmas. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=243.0s)]
*  As the Grinch took the tree, as he started to shove, he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=252.0s)]
*  He turned around fast and he saw a small hoo. Little Cindy Lou, who was no more than two. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=259.0s)]
*  She stared at the Grinch and said, why are you taking our Christmas tree? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=267.0s)]
*  Cartoonish interviews from a press that has become a caricature of itself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=276.0s)]
*  Now, for years under Biden, they didn't sweat needless inflation. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=283.0s)]
*  Prices were through the roof everywhere. It was caused by his overspending. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=288.0s)]
*  But now. Prices are already going up on some popular tires, strollers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=293.0s)]
*  This is such a dishonest interview already. Prices are down on groceries. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=299.0s)]
*  Prices are down for oil. Prices are down for oil energy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=304.0s)]
*  Prices are down at tremendous numbers for gasoline. Even mortgage rates are going down. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=308.0s)]
*  You campaigned on a promise to bring prices down on day. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know why they strollers are going up. What kind of a thing? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=318.0s)]
*  I'm saying that gasoline is going down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=322.0s)]
*  Gasoline is thousands of times more important than a stroller. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=324.0s)]
*  Some. But what do you say? Well, of course, the media, they think that the Americans are too short sighted [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=328.0s)]
*  and ignorant to understand that any disruption we're seeing now or we'll see is temporary, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=336.0s)]
*  that the prize at the end of all of this is trade stabilization and a reindustrialized America [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=341.0s)]
*  that will lead to really sunny days ahead, much more long term sustainability. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=348.0s)]
*  Now, he's talking ultimately about the survival of the United States vis a vis China, but the media, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=355.0s)]
*  they're hung up on Trump hats. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=361.0s)]
*  The Trump Organization is selling hats that say Trump 2028. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=364.0s)]
*  Are you seriously considering a third term, Mr. President? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=368.0s)]
*  It's something that to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=374.0s)]
*  There are many people selling the 2028 hat, but this is not something I'm looking to do. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=377.0s)]
*  I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=383.0s)]
*  Foiled again. The media, I don't know what to do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=390.0s)]
*  Now, we really need to establish some type of mental health charity for these pundits who are masquerading as reporters. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=395.0s)]
*  They keep trying and they keep failing. But listen closely, read between the lines. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=403.0s)]
*  They do not sound like they actually preferred a closed border. They liked an open border. Watch. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=410.0s)]
*  You declared a national emergency on the southern border. When will you know that the emergency is over? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=418.0s)]
*  Are you planning to lift it? The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=424.0s)]
*  And we have some judges that want everybody to go to some of them. Of course, the radical judges are the huge problem here. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=431.0s)]
*  He's right. How do we remain a country when the president cannot remove people who are here illegally? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=437.0s)]
*  It's a good question. But the NBC anchor doesn't care to grapple with good questions, real questions, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=445.0s)]
*  because she believes the emergency is not that we have millions here under fraudulent asylum claims, taking up school spots, taking up funds from local budgets. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=451.0s)]
*  She believes the emergency is that Trump wants to do something about it. So for the press, deportation is the crime, not the act of entering the country illegally. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=463.0s)]
*  Now, if the borders open to millions of illegals, if some terrorists slip through, if some rapists make it in, well, those are just the necessary costs of being, you know, being us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=474.0s)]
*  A superpower that has more money and more privilege than we deserve. They believe it is immoral to pressure China on trade. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=485.0s)]
*  They think it's immoral to hit Europe with tariffs, even as they protect their own industries. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=495.0s)]
*  So is it any wonder that public trust in the media has cratered over the years? According to Gallup, it's at the bottom of the barrel rank just above Congress. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=501.0s)]
*  So you may ask after hearing all this, what is the point of doing these interviews? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=511.0s)]
*  Well, unlike Joe Biden, who hid and was hit in from the media, President Trump obviously believes it's important that the American people hear directly from him, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=516.0s)]
*  even with questions from the establishment media that are blatantly slanted. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=526.0s)]
*  And when the public sees how willing the reporters are to simply lie about Trump's intentions or purposely misconstrue them, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=531.0s)]
*  I think you realize once again that the press really isn't interested in the truth at all. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=540.0s)]
*  They prefer advancing their own narrative instead of reporting on real world problems. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=546.0s)]
*  And with each interview, they're writing their own professional obits. And Trump, he just keeps chugging along. And that's the angle. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=552.0s)]
*  Just on the racetrack, journalism got outjockeyed at the White House. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=561.0s)]
*  I want to keep people fairly, whether they voted for me or not. I want to have a unified country. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=565.0s)]
*  It's very hard because the media is so fake, including, like even the way you ask questions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=572.0s)]
*  Every question is asked in a negative vein. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=577.0s)]
*  There's a toy company that took a toddler's, you know, whatever. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=579.0s)]
*  But you don't talk about the fact that gasoline is down at numbers that nobody believes possible. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=584.0s)]
*  We try to make sure every question is fair, Mr. President. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=590.0s)]
*  Look, every question you ask says a very negative slant. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=594.0s)]
*  No, no, but I'm just curious. Are you? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=597.0s)]
*  I'm fine for responding to you. I don't think you're very difficult at all to respond to, to be honest with you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=599.0s)]
*  You know what? You should ask some positive things. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=604.0s)]
*  No one expects NBC to be a suck up. It's NBC. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=606.0s)]
*  But they have to acknowledge some good things are happening. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=610.0s)]
*  And the fact that they can't do that proves who they're rooting for. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=613.0s)]
*  And it's not America. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=617.0s)]
*  Prices are already going up on some popular items. Tires, strollers. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=619.0s)]
*  This is such a dishonest interview already. Prices are down on groceries. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=624.0s)]
*  Prices are down for oil. Prices are down for oil energy. Prices are down at tremendous numbers for gasoline. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=629.0s)]
*  Inflation is down across the board since Trump's been reelected. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=638.0s)]
*  And NBC is cherry picking two products. But for years gave Joe a pass. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=642.0s)]
*  Trump gets sworn in and NBC starts checking price tags like a penny pincher at a flea market. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=647.0s)]
*  Small businesses say they are being hurt by the Chinese tariffs. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=652.0s)]
*  And some could be forced to shut down. Many businesses are being helped. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=657.0s)]
*  Are you considering tariff relief for small businesses? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=660.0s)]
*  Why do you always mention that, you know, you pick up a couple of little businesses. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=663.0s)]
*  What about the car business? They're going to make a fortune because of the tariffs. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=667.0s)]
*  Do you know that the union, the head of the union, who was no fan of mine, Fain, Sean Fain, I guess his name is, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=671.0s)]
*  He didn't endorse me. The teamsters did. A lot of people did. A lot of unions did. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=677.0s)]
*  But he didn't. He couldn't stand me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=682.0s)]
*  Now he's saying, wow, what's Trump's done for the automobile? I can't believe it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=684.0s)]
*  He said, we've been waiting 40 years for somebody to do what Trump is doing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=689.0s)]
*  So why don't you mention the big car industry instead of mentioning somebody that's doing strollers? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=693.0s)]
*  The media worshiped Barack for bailing out Detroit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=700.0s)]
*  Bin Laden is dead. General Motors is alive. That was the Obama Biden re-election pitch, remember? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=703.0s)]
*  But now Trump saving the car business and he's not even doing it with taxpayer dollars. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=710.0s)]
*  And the media wants to talk about something else with four wheels, strollers, even though they don't want you to have a baby to push them in. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=714.0s)]
*  Then Kristen Welker made a confession. She wants the border unsecured. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=722.0s)]
*  Border crossings are at their lowest level ever recorded. Is the border. Is the border now secure? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=728.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's really secure. Isn't it a beautiful thing when you say it's the most secure it's ever been in the history of our country? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=736.0s)]
*  Isn't that a nice statement? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=743.0s)]
*  Well, I'm curious to know what it means. You declared a national emergency on the southern border. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=745.0s)]
*  The order is still in place, even though you're saying what you said means we have the most secure border we've ever had. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=751.0s)]
*  And I guess the question becomes, when will you know that the emergency is over? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=758.0s)]
*  Are you planning to lift it at some point? Is it necessary? Because obviously the military is involved. Will you lift that that emergency? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=762.0s)]
*  Welker thinks the border is too safe. Can we go back to Biden when there was no national emergency and we just let everybody in? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=769.0s)]
*  Trump's emergency powers are what's keeping the border secure. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=776.0s)]
*  During the pandemic, they never asked Biden, when are you going to give up your emergency powers? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=781.0s)]
*  But Trump's only allowed to yield power for what, 100 days? He's fixing things too quickly? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=786.0s)]
*  Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=791.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=799.0s)]
*  Well, the Fifth Amendment says it's not. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=802.0s)]
*  I don't know. It seems it might say that. But if you're talking about that, then we'd have to have a million or two million or three million trials. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=804.0s)]
*  Even given those numbers that you're talking about, don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States, Mr. President? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=812.0s)]
*  I don't know. I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me. And they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=818.0s)]
*  NBC took that and said, yep, we told you he's a dictator. They ran this headline. Trump asked if he has to uphold the Constitution, says, I don't know. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=829.0s)]
*  New hoax alert. New hoax alert. New hoax alert. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=839.0s)]
*  The I don't know hoax. Trump says he's not a lawyer, but his brilliant lawyers are going to follow the orders of the Supreme Court. Get ready to get sick of that hoax. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=844.0s)]
*  Trump's got a mass deportation mandate. Lower court judges can't let us commit national suicide. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=853.0s)]
*  Biden let our country get invaded and the court never stepped in to stop it. Trump was elected to stop the invasion. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=861.0s)]
*  And now the court step in. So the invasion doesn't get stopped? No, no, no. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=869.0s)]
*  You can't have a functioning sovereign country if you let millions of people invade, give them lawyers and squatters rights. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=874.0s)]
*  Twenty million migrant trials. It took Diddy almost a year before jury selection. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=881.0s)]
*  But Welker wasn't finished. What do you say to those who believe you are taking the country down an authoritarian path? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=888.0s)]
*  Well, there you go again. Why don't you ask it a different way? Many people wanted to come into our country. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=897.0s)]
*  Many people love Trump. I won the election. They didn't win the election. I got a lot more votes than they did. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=902.0s)]
*  I think there was a lot of hanky panky going on, but it was too big to rig. That's the good news. It's too big to rig. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=908.0s)]
*  But let me just say, so when you make these statements about people say this, well, you know, they had their chance at the election and they lost big. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=913.0s)]
*  So you should ask the question differently. You should say, what about the people that want to be in this country? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=921.0s)]
*  What about the people that love this country? When journalists pretend they're not biased, they're obviously lying. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=927.0s)]
*  And that proves their bias. But they're not just biased against Trump. They're biased against the country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=933.0s)]
*  Welker then said, all right, let's cut to the chase. You're running for a third term, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=939.0s)]
*  Are you seriously considering a third term, Mr. President, even though it's prohibited by the Constitution? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=944.0s)]
*  Or is this about staying politically viable? I will say this. So many people want me to do it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=951.0s)]
*  I have never had requests so strong as that. But it's something that to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=957.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything else. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=965.0s)]
*  But there are many people selling the 2028 hat. But this is not something I'm looking to do. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=969.0s)]
*  I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=975.0s)]
*  It feels like the media really wants Trump to run again, doesn't it? Just so they can say, see, we told you he's Mussolini. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=980.0s)]
*  They want to be right so badly the Democrats are begging for Trump to throw them in jail. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=987.0s)]
*  AOC says handcuff me, Homan. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=992.0s)]
*  He was going to threaten to refer me to DOJ because I'm using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutionally guaranteed protections. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=995.0s)]
*  And he may want to do it again today. And so that I say, come for me. You're going to have to come for me. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1007.0s)]
*  AOC has a persecution fetish. She wants to be a political prisoner so badly for the attention so that she can be right about Trump for once. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1013.0s)]
*  And the mugshot. That mugshot helped Trump win the White House. And AOC has her eye on the prize. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1022.0s)]
*  Trump should just arrest her just to make her the nominee. So Vance or whoever can smoke her. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1028.0s)]
*  Hollywood says Trump's going to destroy the world. Here's Sean Penn. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1034.0s)]
*  I do think it's a reasonable theory that Donald Trump is not unlike the spouse of someone who leaves him perhaps for another who then murders their former partner because if they can't have her, nobody can. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1040.0s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump and his solipsism may have that relationship with the world and that this destruction is in part a power play and also a literal intention of his final out. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1054.0s)]
*  I think he might try to destroy the world before he ages out of life. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1067.0s)]
*  Trump's making peace deals in Europe and in the Middle East. Sean Penn 20 years ago would have had a MAGA hat. Probably with a cigarette stuck to his lip, obviously. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1073.0s)]
*  They said the world was going to end eight years ago when Trump got elected and now it's going to end again. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1083.0s)]
*  And the world was going to end from global warming too. But guess what? Antarctica gained ice for the first time in decades. Look at that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1089.0s)]
*  Gore said the ice sheets would be gone. And NBC says the FBI director's popping bottles with models in the club. Except he's not. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1097.0s)]
*  Let's circle back to a segment from Friday show. Frank Fugluzzi was on that morning during this hour discussing the work of administration officials. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1106.0s)]
*  At the end of that segment, Fugluzzi said that FBI director Cash Patel has reportedly been more visible at nightclubs than at his office at FBI headquarters. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1113.0s)]
*  This was a misstatement. We have not verified that claim. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1122.0s)]
*  Not a great weekend for journalism. The other big scandal this weekend, Trump posted a picture of himself as the Pope. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1125.0s)]
*  The Catholics were not so happy about the image of you looking like the Pope. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1134.0s)]
*  Oh, I see. You mean they can't take a joke. You don't mean the Catholics. You mean the fake news media. Not the Catholics loved it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1139.0s)]
*  I had nothing to do with it. Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the Pope and they put it out on the Internet. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1146.0s)]
*  That's not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was A.I. But I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1153.0s)]
*  Actually, my wife thought it was cute. She said, isn't that nice? I think it's a fake news media that, you know, they they're fakers. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1163.0s)]
*  Melania thought Trump looked cute as Pope. Now that is love. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1170.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the White House posted a juiced up photo of 47 with a red lightsaber. May the fourth be with you. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1175.0s)]
*  Happy May 4th to all the radical left lunatics who are fighting so hard to bring Sith Lords, murderers, drug lords, dangerous prisoners and well-known MS 13 gang members back into our galaxy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1182.0s)]
*  You're not the rebellion. You're the empire. Trump has a special place for him. He's bringing back Alcatraz. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1195.0s)]
*  It represents something very strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. Our country needs law and order. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1202.0s)]
*  Alcatraz is I would say the ultimate Alcatraz Sing Sing and Alcatraz. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1209.0s)]
*  The movies. But it's right now a museum, believe it or not. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1215.0s)]
*  A lot of people go there. It has the most violent criminals in the world and nobody ever escaped. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1220.0s)]
*  One person almost got there, but they, as you know, the story, they found his clothing rather badly ripped up. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1228.0s)]
*  And it was a lot of shark bites, a lot of a lot of problems. Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1235.0s)]
*  The media and the Democrats woke up today and were forced to talk about Alcatraz. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1242.0s)]
*  Please don't send foreign criminals to Alcatraz. You see what Trump's making him do? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1247.0s)]
*  They look loony and he looks like a creative problem solver. Trump's even solving a problem for balls in the White House. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1252.0s)]
*  You're going to make and build a ballroom which they've wanted for probably 100 years at the White House. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1261.0s)]
*  And it'll be a world class, beautiful ballroom, a ballroom that could cost millions of dollars. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1268.0s)]
*  He says he will pay for it himself. You will fund it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1274.0s)]
*  I'm not going to ask the government for money. Would a dictator do that? I don't think so. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1278.0s)]
*  Biden built a new situation room, made you pay for it. And then when they found the cocaine, blame the construction workers. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1283.0s)]
*  Trump's hoping to get that ballroom built soon because the NFL draft is coming to D.C. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1290.0s)]
*  I'm pleased to reveal that the 2027 NFL draft, that's a big thing, will be held right here in our nation's capital, Washington, D.C. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1296.0s)]
*  on the National Mall. And you get a little glimpse of it. I was just saying to Roger, I don't think there's ever been anything like that. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1307.0s)]
*  That's a good idea. In fact, maybe we could use it for other things also. I have an idea. It's going to be beautiful. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1315.0s)]
*  It's going to be something that nobody else will ever be able to duplicate that, I don't suspect. It's very exciting. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1322.0s)]
*  So we have a military parade and the NFL draft coming to Washington. What did Biden bring to D.C. besides crime? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1328.0s)]
*  And by the way, when I was in D.C. the other day for the Musk interview, there's no more homeless at the train station. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1335.0s)]
*  Union Station used to be crawling with homeless. I didn't see a single sleeping bag. Even Trump's old enemies say he's doing a good job. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1341.0s)]
*  And he's actually friendly, unlike Barack. He never did my show when he did every other show. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1349.0s)]
*  I had to go on the air and beg him on my 60th birthday in his eighth year in office and shame him into it basically. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1357.0s)]
*  And he finally did. But you know, it was at the White House, it was in the interview room. It wasn't fun. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1366.0s)]
*  He must have had someone around him saying, you know, I'm a very dangerous person, Louis. That's the thing. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1373.0s)]
*  I'm a dangerous person who nobody can trust because I might tell the truth about something or ask a hard question. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1378.0s)]
*  As far as like just feeling free to just speak exactly how I feel. Yes, I felt freer to do that with Trump than Obama or Clinton. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1384.0s)]
*  This isn't a dictatorship. It's a counterrevolution. And journalism can't keep up. They're stuck protecting the status quo. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1394.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's planning for the future. Who's the next horse? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1402.0s)]
*  Do you think the MAGA movement can survive without you as its leader? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1407.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. What gives you? I think it's so strong and I think we have tremendous people. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1411.0s)]
*  I think we have a tremendous group of people. We talked about a number of them. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1416.0s)]
*  You look at Marco, you look at J.D. Vance, who's fantastic. You look at I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1421.0s)]
*  No, I think we have a tremendous party. And you know what? I can't name. I can't name one Democrat. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1429.0s)]
*  I mean, I look at the Democrats. They're in total disarray. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1433.0s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. And tonight there is one person who got paid to lie for Joe Biden at the White House and then got paid even more than that. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1443.0s)]
*  And now circle back. Jen Psaki is trying to rewrite history after enthusiastically endorsing Biden's mental and physical fitness for years. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1450.0s)]
*  We're going to take you down memory lane and we'll circle back later with a message for Jen Psaki. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1460.0s)]
*  Plus, I regret to inform you, Michelle Obama is once again complaining about the burden of living in the White House. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1465.0s)]
*  Take a look. It's expensive to live in the White House. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1472.0s)]
*  Many people don't know. I mean, much is not covered. You're paying for every food, every bit of food that you eat. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1476.0s)]
*  You know, you're not paying for housing and the staff in it, but everything, even travel. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1484.0s)]
*  Well, today we'll analyze their finances just a little bit and see if it was worth their while. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1489.0s)]
*  Jimmy Fela also will respond in our other news of the day segment and stay tuned. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1494.0s)]
*  I think you'll like it. But first, our top story promises made, promises kept. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1500.0s)]
*  Take a look. Border crossings are at their lowest level ever recorded. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1505.0s)]
*  Is the border good? Is the border now secure? Yeah, it's really secure. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1511.0s)]
*  It's absolutely when you say that, doesn't it just sound good after being abused for years by an incompetent president that allowed people to go to the border? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1516.0s)]
*  Criminals from all over the world, murderers and insane people from mental institutions and insane asylums. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1525.0s)]
*  Isn't it? Isn't it a beautiful thing when you say it's the most secure it's ever been in the history of our country? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1532.0s)]
*  Isn't that a nice statement? I would have liked to have heard her answer anyway. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1539.0s)]
*  They said it would never happen. Now, not only is the border secure, but NBC News is saying that it's the most secure border in the history of our country. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1543.0s)]
*  And now not only is the border secure, but NBC News is well, for once allowing the president to tell the truth. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1552.0s)]
*  Obviously, Democrats either open the border on purpose or they are the most incompetent people to ever walk the planet. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1558.0s)]
*  This is the single most preventable national security disaster ever. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1565.0s)]
*  But it's up to President Trump to clean up their mess. And his work is only getting started with border crossings down to almost nothing. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1571.0s)]
*  The White House is getting creative. A brand new program from the DHS now offering to buy a one way plane ticket out of the U.S. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1578.0s)]
*  Pay a thousand dollars to illegal immigrants willing to self deport. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1588.0s)]
*  This initiative could save all of you billions and billions of dollars in court costs between what we pay in education, health care, of course, the criminal justice system and other ICE related expenses. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1593.0s)]
*  And that's not all. President Trump also offering to help Mexico destroy the violent cartels now designated as terrorist organizations. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1607.0s)]
*  Take a look. Mexico is saying that I offered to send U.S. troops into Mexico to take care of the cartels. He wants to know, is that true? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1616.0s)]
*  Do you think I'm going to answer that question? That's why I'm asking. I will answer it. It's true. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1625.0s)]
*  As promised, President Trump is ready and willing to use all options to secure our country, protect all of you from fentanyl, gang violence, murder, rape and other heinous violent crimes. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1633.0s)]
*  Naturally, Democrats are up in arms for whatever reason. Apparently, they really don't want the border to be secured. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1645.0s)]
*  They don't want anyone deported, seemingly for any reason. For weeks, Congresswoman AOC has been distributing materials on how to evade ICE and avoid deportation. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1651.0s)]
*  Now, some have accused the Congresswoman of actually aiding and abetting and law breaking. Doesn't seem to care. She's now trying to taunt. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1661.0s)]
*  Borders are. Tom Homan. Good luck in this fight. Take a look. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1669.0s)]
*  Tom Homan, then acting director of ICE, said that he was going to threaten to refer me to DOJ because I'm using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutionally guaranteed protection. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1673.0s)]
*  And you may want to do it again today. And to that I say, come for me. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1688.0s)]
*  Of course, liberals believe that illegals have constitutional rights. Tom Homan has indeed referred the leader of the Democrats to the DOJ. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1694.0s)]
*  But as you can see, top Democrats, they continue to advocate for the rights of illegal immigrants over the safety of you and your family. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1701.0s)]
*  In fact, fake news CNN, who could never find the courage to investigate Biden's cognitive decline, just traveled all the way to a cartel hotspot in western Mexico to come face to face with a member of the notorious Sinaloa cartel in order to ask him, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1709.0s)]
*  How do you feel about being labeled a terrorist organization by the Trump administration? I wonder how he's feeling. Let's look. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1727.0s)]
*  According to the Trump administration, you are a terrorist. The cartels have been labeled a foreign terrorist organization. What do you make of that? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1735.0s)]
*  What's your message to Donald Trump if he's watching this? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1749.0s)]
*  If he didn't have any followers, then he would have stopped. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1765.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is now in state prison, brutally stabbing three correctional officers there. On Sunday, young members of Trende Aragua assaulted a pair of NYPD officers in Times Square in New York City. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1795.0s)]
*  In California, three illegal immigrants were charged with a horrific murder. They are accused of killing a man during a home invasion. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1807.0s)]
*  One of these suspected killers was facing two ICE detainers because of his criminal record, but was shielded by California's sanctuary city policies. Great job, Gavin. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1815.0s)]
*  This is who Democrats are protecting. Not you, not your kids, not your grandkids, not law-abiding citizens. They are protecting criminal, illegal aliens and fighting tooth and nail to keep them in your neighborhood. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1825.0s)]
*  If you want to know more about these crimes and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoi9XF_6Hs&t=1845.0s)]
