# Fox News Highlights - May 30th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0)
*  The Doge father brought a chainsaw to Washington and after 130 days he's saying goodbye. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=0.0s)]

*  Numbers have just come out which are rather extraordinary and I thought I'd play a tape [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=15.76s)]
*  of one of the people who I've respected over the years from you know Joe Kiernan and Rick [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=19.8s)]
*  Santelli this just came out and we'll just play that for a second. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=26.68s)]
*  Personal income is up eight tenths of a percent that is almost triple the expectations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Trump wants to be a Fox News anchor he throws the soundbites argues with guests. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=38.76s)]
*  Welcome to Oval Office primetime tonight but it was Elon's day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=44.32s)]
*  He's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=50.64s)]
*  he stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation and we appreciate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=55.44s)]
*  it and I just want to say that Elon has worked tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=61.84s)]
*  and consequential government reform program in generations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=67.6s)]
*  A hundred and seventy five billion dollars in waste was doged. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=71.84s)]
*  Government computers were modernized and two percent of the workforce accepted very generous [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=76.16s)]
*  packages but we'll always remember Elon when we see the shiny red Tesla. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=81.44s)]
*  Caroline and Margot took it out for a spin last night and if you look closely Stephen [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=86.96s)]
*  Miller is in the back. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=91.36s)]
*  Forty seven gave Musk a key to the White House and said he'll be back and forth because [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=93.44s)]
*  Doge is his baby. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=97.72s)]
*  Just because Musk is leaving doesn't mean Doge is going anywhere. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  Big balls is embedded. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  This is not the end of Doge but really the beginning. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=109.52s)]
*  It was a limited time thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=112.08s)]
*  It's 134 days I believe which ends in a few days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=113.52s)]
*  So that comes with the time limit. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=116.56s)]
*  But the Doge team will only grow stronger over time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  The Doge influence will only grow stronger. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  It's likened to a sort of Buddhism. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=127.44s)]
*  It's like a way of life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=129.96s)]
*  So it is permeating throughout the government and I'm confident that over time we'll see [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=132.16s)]
*  a trillion dollars of savings and a reduction in a trillion dollars of waste of production. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=136.84s)]
*  Elon was in good spirits but he had a black eye. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=143.76s)]
*  Who hit him? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=146.84s)]
*  Must have been a lefty. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=148.12s)]
*  Is your eye okay? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=150.04s)]
*  What happened to your eye? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=151.04s)]
*  I noticed there was a bruise there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=152.04s)]
*  Well it wasn't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=153.04s)]
*  I wasn't anywhere near France. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=154.04s)]
*  So. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=155.04s)]
*  But. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=156.04s)]
*  Yeah I was just walking around with the lex and I said go ahead punch me in the face and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=157.04s)]
*  he did. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=165.32s)]
*  I thought even a five year old punching you in the face actually. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  That was exed? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  Ex could do it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Like Musk said he wasn't the only one this week to take a beating. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=173.4s)]
*  This week there was a video on Morta Plain that showed the first lady of France slapping [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=177.56s)]
*  her husband Emmanuel Macron. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=183.12s)]
*  Do you have any world leader to world leader marital advice on this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Make sure the door remains closed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=193.16s)]
*  That was not good. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=195.12s)]
*  I spoke to him and he's fine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=198.12s)]
*  They're fine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=201.24s)]
*  They're two really good people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=202.24s)]
*  I know them very well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=204.12s)]
*  And I don't know what that was all about but I know them very well and they're fine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=205.8s)]
*  What's worse getting a black eye from your wife or your kid? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=212.76s)]
*  Probably your wife. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=216.4s)]
*  CNN says it was Washington that gave him the black eye. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=217.4s)]
*  He has a black eye. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  But don't you think that black eye is also going to become a metaphor for a thousand [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  articles about his time in Washington? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=226.0s)]
*  This is a guy who was able to conquer basically every industry that he set out to succeed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=228.56s)]
*  in and Washington DC may be the only one where he's going away with a black eye. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=233.24s)]
*  Stelter doesn't think Musk succeeded in Washington because Stelter thinks anyone who leaves Washington [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=238.84s)]
*  failed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Musk did more in 130 days than politicians do in three decades and then he went back [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  to building cars and rockets. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  He's not just sulking like he lost a campaign. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=252.44000000000003s)]
*  The New York Times on Musk's last day called him a drug addict. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=255.68s)]
*  Quote, he told people he was taking so much ketamine that it was affecting his bladder. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=260.36s)]
*  He took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms and he traveled with a daily medication box [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  that held about 20 pills including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=270.68s)]
*  Our very own stupid son of a bitch asked Elon about the Times allegation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=276.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=281.28s)]
*  So there is a New York Times report today that accuses you of blurring the line between... [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=282.28s)]
*  Is the New York Times, is that the same publication that's got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=289.04s)]
*  on the Russia gate? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=296.44s)]
*  Is it the same organization? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=297.92s)]
*  I gotta check my Pulitzer counters. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=300.08s)]
*  I think the judge just ruled against the New York Times for their lies about the Russia [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=304.28s)]
*  gate hoax and that they might have to give back that Pulitzer Prize. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=309.44s)]
*  That New York Times, let's move on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  There was an actual drug addict who last spring was kind of running the country and the Times [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=316.61999999999995s)]
*  didn't notice. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=322.2s)]
*  They found cocaine in the White House and the Times never cared and they never accused [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=323.55999999999995s)]
*  Hunter but they were accusing Musk with no evidence. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  CNN jumped in and defended the Times. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=332.24s)]
*  I think we have to revisit it and not let it stand alone because he talks about the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=335.48s)]
*  Russia hoax. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=338.76s)]
*  We just have to be very clear that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=339.76s)]
*  The Mueller report did not find collusion but Mueller was very clear he did not exonerate [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=349.92s)]
*  Yeah, so CNN admitted we were right about Biden's brain, the border inflation, but they [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=350.92s)]
*  just won't let go of the Russia hoax. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=354.96s)]
*  MSNBC said Musk's more deadly than the Vietnam War. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=358.72s)]
*  He talked about bringing the woodchipper to USAID. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=364.16s)]
*  They have a tracker. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=367.8s)]
*  300,000 deaths. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=369.8s)]
*  According to a Boston University professor, because of the aid cuts so far, 200,000 of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=374.72s)]
*  them children. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, Vietnam War, you all remember that? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  60,000 US service members died. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=382.52s)]
*  This is five times more deaths. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=385.02s)]
*  Cutting spending is a war crime in Washington. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=388.74s)]
*  Musk dozed Sesame Street in Iraq and they're calling it an atrocity. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=391.85999999999996s)]
*  Anyone who dies in Africa, now it's Elon's fault. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, if there's 300,000 deaths since Doge, where are the bodies? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=399.44s)]
*  Why doesn't MSNBC have videos of mass graves? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  A professor is making up numbers so MSNBC can accuse them of genocide and Democrats [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=407.46s)]
*  can open an investigation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=412.46s)]
*  That's exactly how hoaxes start. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=414.7s)]
*  I think some crimes may have been committed over the past three or four months and they [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=417.62s)]
*  are going to come to light one way or another. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=421.06s)]
*  We're going to come to light even if it takes us getting into power again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=424.06s)]
*  But we will subpoena people and find out. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  Elon puts his five companies on ice for four months to help cut pork and make government [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  more efficient. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  And Democrats firebombed his cars and called him a Nazi and accused him of taking drugs. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  Oh, and there's a cherry on top. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=439.62s)]
*  If they take the house back, they're going to make his life hell and find his companies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=441.9s)]
*  They've already made the world's wealthiest man the Republican Party's biggest donor. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=446.62s)]
*  And they keep going. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  They've made themselves the enemy in his eyes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  You think Musk can let this slide? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  I think the fundamental moral flaw of the left is empathy for the criminals and not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=459.82s)]
*  empathy for the victims. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=465.26s)]
*  Empathy for the criminals, but not empathy for the victims. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=468.06s)]
*  And there's been way too much of that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=471.18s)]
*  That needs to stop. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=473.14s)]
*  To the president's point, there's been immense judicial overreach that is unconstitutional. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=474.22s)]
*  That was never intended. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=479.3s)]
*  And it's undermining the people's faith in the legal system. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=482.66s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=485.3s)]
*  It's gone too far. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=487.3s)]
*  The country's begging the Democrats to get it together so we can work together for the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=488.66s)]
*  good of the country. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=493.06s)]
*  Building and maintaining human civilization's serious business. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=495.02s)]
*  We can lose this country like that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=498.88s)]
*  The Roman Empire, the British Empire, here one day, gone the next. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=501.52s)]
*  What does it say about how serious the Democrats are when they make Kamala Harris A.I. czar [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=506.64s)]
*  and spend trillions on windmills that don't work? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=511.94s)]
*  Wall Street's starting to get it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=515.52s)]
*  Here's JP Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=517.4s)]
*  The Biden administration is giving all its money to EVs and cars and wasting a lot of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=520.36s)]
*  money on green stuff, which isn't going to work and all that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=524.24s)]
*  Do you think people in rural cities, do you think people in inner cities thought they [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  were getting anything? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=531.68s)]
*  Do you think that those people think that the American government is fair and competent [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=533.68s)]
*  and that this was in their best interest? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=537.4799999999999s)]
*  Their schools don't work. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=539.2399999999999s)]

*  And you heard that just now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=541.2399999999999s)]
*  So we've got to acknowledge it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=543.68s)]
*  And I also call it blue tape. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=545.2399999999999s)]
*  Because Republicans, you generally don't like red tape. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=547.52s)]
*  You understand the devastation of it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  But most Democrats, they love it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=552.52s)]
*  They want more of it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=554.4s)]
*  And they want to make it so confusing you can't even meet the rules. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=555.56s)]
*  You get punished and fined afterwards. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=558.12s)]
*  If we doge the Democrats, we'd make America so efficient. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  Imagine what we could accomplish. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=564.4s)]
*  Elon's building robo-taxis. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=566.72s)]
*  I saw him in LA last weekend. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=568.88s)]
*  Computerized cars are just picking people up and taking them to dinner. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=570.92s)]
*  He's building tunnels in Vegas and building rockets to go to Mars, putting chips in people's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  brains to cure ALS. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=580.52s)]
*  It's an incredible privilege to be a part of this and have someone like Elon Musk, one [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=583.64s)]
*  of the most powerful men in the world, so involved, so interested in affecting my life [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=592.16s)]
*  and people with disabilities right now. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=600.88s)]
*  I just can't even put it into words. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  And the guys and gals at Neuralink, they are the hardest workers that I've ever met in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=605.84s)]
*  my life and they have such passion for helping people. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=611.84s)]
*  We're in the beginning of the AI revolution and the world's about to change, change big. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=614.04s)]
*  We have a pioneer who broke the mold like Rockefeller or Ford or Jobs. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=619.96s)]
*  Elon's not perfect, nobody is, but he's not a villain. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=625.6s)]
*  He's a legend. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=629.76s)]
*  And if we want successful public servants to serve the country like they used to instead [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=631.24s)]
*  of lazy lawyers who get elected to Congress and spend all day fundraising and making up [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=636.24s)]
*  laws, we have to support them, whether they're on the right or the left. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=640.24s)]
*  We shouldn't fight just to fight because they're on the other side. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=644.92s)]
*  If there's a Democrat billionaire who wants to upgrade the old computers in Washington, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=648.76s)]
*  we'll back that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=653.16s)]
*  We have to be grateful when people help us instead of when they help themselves. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=655.04s)]
*  This country has to come together so that we don't get left behind. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=660.28s)]
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=665.28s)]
*  All right, who knew what? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=667.08s)]
*  What did they know? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=668.4s)]
*  Did they know it? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  And who was really in charge of your country for the last four years? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=670.92s)]
*  Now remember earlier this week, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, he sounded [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  the alarm over Biden's use of the auto pen. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=679.8s)]
*  He did it right here on this show. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=684.04s)]
*  Here's a reminder. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=685.68s)]
*  Who was giving the authority for use of the auto pen? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=687.68s)]
*  Remember Sean, there was more activity in the last 100 days of the Biden administration [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  than the first three and a half years of the Biden administration. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  Many of the far reaching executive orders were signed during the last 100 days and they [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  were all signed by the auto pen. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, the auto pen. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=708.04s)]
*  Three and a half years, more than the last 100 days. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=711.04s)]
*  Did Joe know about it? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=714.52s)]
*  We like answers. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=716.36s)]
*  Anyway, for years we on this program, we made it important to tell you the truth about Joe [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=717.36s)]
*  Biden, his obvious, very obvious cognitive decline. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=722.56s)]
*  We started reporting on it in 2019. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=727.16s)]
*  We'll get to that in a minute. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=729.16s)]
*  All the state run legacy media mob and Democrats, they were lying to you day in and day out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=730.16s)]
*  Cheap, fake videos. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=737.28s)]
*  They weren't cheap, fake videos. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=738.28s)]
*  Now finally, the truth has been revealed about this abuse of the office of the presidency [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=739.56s)]
*  and the subsequent coverup, which has now quickly become the biggest presidential White [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=745.64s)]
*  House scandal in our country's history. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  Now the media will ignore that too. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=754.1999999999999s)]
*  The left so hated Donald Trump. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=756.28s)]
*  They hated him so much that they were willing to put your national security at risk. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=758.4s)]
*  And as one aid even admitted to fake Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, even act undemocratically [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=763.88s)]
*  and democracies in peril, they said before the election. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=770.64s)]
*  And meanwhile, it was by them just to stop Donald Trump and just show proof of life occasionally. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=773.88s)]
*  You know, he doesn't really have to run things if he's reelected. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  We'll just, you know, trot him out every once in a while. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=784.12s)]
*  Let everybody know he's alive and let him go back and take a nap. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=787.28s)]
*  And by the way, let unknown people run the country. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=791.0s)]
*  Almost every Democrat White House staffer, so-called journalist, I said in 2007, journalism [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=794.4s)]
*  is dead. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=800.92s)]
*  Everyone in the fake news media mob, they all work to deceive the American public because [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=802.24s)]
*  they don't like Donald Trump and they don't like the American people and their choice. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=807.92s)]
*  You all deserve answers. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=812.8s)]
*  And finally, we are starting to get some. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=814.56s)]
*  We will be unrelenting on this show. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=817.2s)]
*  We're going to get to the bottom of all of this. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=818.88s)]
*  Now, according to fake Jake and Alex Thompson's book, Biden needed a script just to get through [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  cabinet meetings with one cabinet member telling Tapper and Thompson, quote, the cabinet meetings [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=827.0s)]
*  were terrible and at times uncomfortable. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=832.38s)]
*  And they were from the beginning. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=835.5s)]
*  I don't recall a great cabinet meeting in terms of his presence. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=836.88s)]
*  So they were all scripted and no kidding. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=840.88s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=844.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=846.1600000000001s)]
*  Joe couldn't even conduct the full meetings himself. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=848.12s)]
*  Remember, he had to turn it over to Dr. Jill, his wife. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=849.9599999999999s)]
*  She wasn't elected to any position. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=853.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  This is the first time Jill has joined us and go to the show. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=856.8399999999999s)]
*  How important issue is what she's about to speak to the both of us today at the top of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  our meeting. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=865.48s)]
*  Jill's going to give an update on the House initiative, White House initiative to fundamentally [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=866.48s)]
*  change the approach and the fun and how we approach and fund women's health services. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=872.6s)]
*  So I'd like to turn it over to Jill and for any comments she has. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  It's all yours, kid. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=882.84s)]
*  All yours, kid. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=886.2s)]
*  He reads a script. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=887.2s)]
*  You know, the speech writers, according to the book, shrank not only the vocabulary, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=888.2s)]
*  but they shrank the speech because they knew he was incapable of getting through this. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  Now here's a question a lot of people probably are not going to like that I ask. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=896.72s)]
*  What did his family know? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=901.6s)]
*  What did his wife know? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  What did his children know? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  What did his grandchildren know? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=906.76s)]
*  They had to see far worse than the rest of the country. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=908.52s)]
*  You probably only saw Joe at his best. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=910.96s)]
*  They would be complicit. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=914.44s)]
*  Also, to me, tough questions need to be asked of every single family member, starting with [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jill and Hunter. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  Now yesterday, when asked about Jill Biden potentially testifying before Congress, White [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  House press secretary Caroline Levitt had this to say. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=928.52s)]
*  Is the president satisfied with aides only sitting for these transcribed interviews or [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  would he also like to see some kind of testimony from the former first lady, Dr. Biden? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=939.28s)]
*  I think, frankly, the former first lady should certainly speak up about what she saw in regards [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  to her husband and when she saw and what she knew, because I think anybody looking again [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=950.08s)]
*  at the videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=955.84s)]
*  sense can see this was a clear cover up. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=960.52s)]
*  And Jill Biden was certainly complicit in that cover up. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  There are documentation, video evidence of her clearly shielding her husband away from [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  the cameras. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=972.28s)]
*  They were just on the view last week. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=973.28s)]
*  She was saying everything is fine. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=974.96s)]
*  She's still lying to the American people. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=976.36s)]
*  She still thinks the American public are so stupid that they're going to believe her [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=978.24s)]
*  lies and frankly, it's insulting and she needs to answer for it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=981.68s)]
*  Remember, Joe, he would shake like air. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=985.68s)]
*  Nobody's there. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=987.88s)]
*  And then somebody would have to come out. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=988.88s)]
*  Oh, no, come on. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=990.52s)]
*  Walk off this way, Joe. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=991.52s)]
*  We went on. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=993.68s)]
*  That went on for four years. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=994.68s)]
*  What we're seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg as it relates to the scandal. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=995.68s)]
*  And frankly, this is like the dumbest lie ever told. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1000.8s)]
*  Democrats, their allies and the state run legacy media mob, they simply asked you not [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1004.76s)]
*  to believe your lying eyes for years. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1010.22s)]
*  Joe Biden's cognitive decline was readily apparent to everyone from the moment Biden [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1013.88s)]
*  jumped in the presidential race. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1020.04s)]
*  We identified it in 2019. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1022.66s)]
*  His struggles were clear, unambiguous. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1025.24s)]
*  They were obvious. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1028.12s)]
*  This was not the same guy that was Obama's vice president, not the same guy that was [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1029.56s)]
*  a senator. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1034.64s)]
*  He didn't walk the same. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1035.64s)]
*  He didn't look the same. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1036.64s)]
*  He didn't sound the same. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1037.64s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1040.12s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1041.68s)]
*  Let's take a look at some of, well, the lowlights. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1043.52s)]
*  If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1045.8s)]
*  We choose truth over facts. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1052.0s)]
*  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1054.52s)]
*  Play the radio. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1057.76s)]
*  Make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1058.76s)]
*  make sure the kids hear words. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1064.56s)]
*  It's time for America to get back up on its feet and once again fight for the proposition [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1066.52s)]
*  that we hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1071.76s)]
*  Sounds corny. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1074.0s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1075.0s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1076.0s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1077.0s)]
*  All men and women created by the, you know the thing. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1079.56s)]
*  You know how we talk about it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1083.8799999999999s)]
*  Are we the people? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  The record player, truth over facts created by the thing, you know, the God, the creator [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1087.04s)]
*  of everything. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  Democrats, the media mob lied to you over and over again. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1095.4399999999998s)]
*  They claimed that they showed you the real Joe Biden, but they did not. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1099.24s)]
*  On this program, we take great pride in telling you the truth. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1103.72s)]
*  We showed you the real Joe Biden. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1107.26s)]
*  We sounded the alarm starting in 2019 about his struggles. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1109.16s)]
*  We did it from the very beginning. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1113.36s)]
*  We have the tape to prove it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1115.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1116.74s)]
*  There is a panic. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1117.74s)]
*  All Joe being Joe, the verbal mishaps are piling up by the second, raising serious questions [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1119.32s)]
*  among Democrats about his viability. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1126.18s)]
*  It is fair for every American to ask whether or not this 78-year-old has the strength, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1128.84s)]
*  the stamina, the focus and the capacity to handle what is by far the toughest job in [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1134.84s)]
*  the world. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1140.32s)]
*  Now to me, quid pro quo Joe seems to be in a rapid state of decline and not up to the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1141.32s)]
*  rigors needed even on a campaign. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1145.72s)]
*  Only after his disastrous debate with President Trump last June, when it became apparent he [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1148.6799999999998s)]
*  had no chance of winning reelection, oh, all of a sudden they noticed everything we've [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  been telling you from 2019 onward. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1158.28s)]
*  The left reversed course and state the obvious. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1161.72s)]
*  No, they did it from political expediency. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1165.04s)]
*  This was a man completely incapable of doing what is the hardest job in the world. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1168.32s)]
*  Amid the growing evidence of the biggest coverup in White House and presidential history, Biden [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1174.72s)]
*  reemerged today to deliver a Memorial Day address nearly a week late. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1180.16s)]
*  Let's just say he didn't exactly ease anyone's concerns. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  Our politics have become so divided and so bitter. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1191.72s)]
*  All the years I've been doing this, I never thought we'd get to this point. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  But we are. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1198.8000000000002s)]
*  Our troops don't wear a uniform that says I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1200.72s)]
*  It says I'm an American. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1204.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm an American. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1206.88s)]
*  That's who I am. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1207.88s)]
*  Every nation was founded on geography, ethnicity, some unifying principle, but not an idea. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  The idea of what America was founded on, we hold these troops to be self-evident. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1217.04s)]
*  But all men and women are created equal. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1221.28s)]
*  And down by the creator of certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of that, we made it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1223.52s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1228.72s)]
*  American democracy has endured for nearly 250 years. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1229.9199999999998s)]
*  Every generation, every generation, every generation has to fight to maintain that democracy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1234.8s)]
*  Every time, every generation. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1243.28s)]
*  Now, after screaming those remarks, he spoke to reporters and launched into more rambling, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1246.08s)]
*  mumbling, bumbling, bizarre moments. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1253.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1255.4399999999998s)]
*  So what was it important to tell you? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  I feel like everybody expects. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  I've done it all because I'm demoralized. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  I do it every day and year. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  And there's also been a lot of discussion recently about your mental and physical capabilities [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1263.9199999999998s)]
*  while you were in office. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  You can see that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1271.28s)]
*  I'm mentally incompetent and I can't walk. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1272.32s)]
*  I can beat the hell out of both of them. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1274.48s)]
*  Do you want to reply to any of those reports and also to the fact that there are some Democrats [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1276.48s)]
*  who are now questioning whether you should have run for reelection in the first place? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1281.84s)]
*  Why are you running against me now? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1285.76s)]
*  Do you have anything to say to the press secretary about [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1288.24s)]
*  what happened to your wife yesterday at the briefing? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1291.6s)]
*  I don't know anything about the press secretary. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1297.6s)]
*  He can't even climb stairs. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1301.2s)]
*  He can't even stand up straight. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1303.04s)]
*  He can't even ride a bicycle. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1304.56s)]
*  He's going to beat up people. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1306.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1307.6s)]
*  Republicans, they need to get to the bottom of this. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1308.3999999999999s)]
*  This is serious. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  The country, you deserve the truth and we need to hold everyone involved in this cover-up. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1312.0s)]
*  They need to all be held accountable. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1318.72s)]
*  The House Oversight Committee and their chairman, James Comer, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  is trying to do just that after sending letters last week demanding [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1323.92s)]

*  and everybody that dealt with him understood that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1372.0s)]
*  And I guess it came out during the debate loud and clear. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1374.32s)]

*  Well, it turns out they can't even get the words right. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1817.28s)]
*  As the Washington Post notes, several Dems are calling out the party [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1819.6s)]
*  for being too reliant on deliberately confusing jargon. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  The kind of fancy talk that makes everything more complicated than it needs to be. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1826.08s)]
*  Much like the scarves worn by Mr. Furly. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1830.8s)]
*  They simply distract and camouflage what's less appealing beneath the surface. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1835.44s)]
*  They do it to show off, but also to confuse. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  And they expect you not to admit you're confused because then you'll be seen as stupid. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1843.28s)]
*  And boy does this work on libs who rely so heavily on social status and acceptance from the in-crowd. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  Words like social equity, gender affirming care, and reproductive justice. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1854.56s)]
*  They're designed to sound smart and get nods of approval from other know-it-alls [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1859.6s)]
*  while covering up the idiotic ideas behind them. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  As Kentucky Democratic Governor Andy Beshear said, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1866.8s)]
*  Democrats speak like professors and started using advocacy speak [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1869.76s)]
*  that was meant to reduce stigma, but also remove the meaning and emotion behind words. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1873.6000000000001s)]
*  It makes Democrats or candidates using this speech sound like they're not normal. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1878.64s)]
*  So you get that? The speech makes them sound not normal. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1884.48s)]
*  But how can you sound normal if the ideas at their root are abnormal? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1889.28s)]
*  So what if they replace the obtuse language with real words? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1894.72s)]
*  Then you'd end up in a worse place, revealing truly terrible ideas for everyone to see. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1898.4s)]
*  The reason you needed the flowery language around identity politics, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  social justice, and gender ideology is because those ideas are so unbelievably f***ed. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1906.96s)]
*  Which is why the left focuses only on the how and not the what [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  of the beliefs that contaminate their party. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  Right, Petey? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1922.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a condescension that is imputed to Democrats [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1923.0400000000002s)]
*  that I think we really need to deal with. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1926.24s)]
*  So much of politics is not just how you make people feel, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  how you make people feel about themselves. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  And so much of what they think of you comes down to what they think you think of them. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1938.4s)]
*  And largely because of our very justified horror at the abuses of Donald Trump as a candidate [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1944.16s)]
*  and as a president, we've said and done things that make voters feel like we're [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1950.8s)]
*  talking about them when we're talking about him. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1956.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, he said nothing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1958.5600000000002s)]
*  But he's right on one thing, snobbery. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1961.92s)]
*  But take that away, what's left? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  Seriously, is there a non-patronizing way of pushing the same ideas? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1967.76s)]
*  Please tell me the humble way of telling me you're going to let dudes crush girls in sports. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1971.76s)]
*  Please respectfully convince us that DEI works and punishing criminals doesn't, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1976.72s)]
*  or that kids should have their puberty blocked, or that Kamala wasn't as dumb as plant soil. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1982.0s)]
*  It doesn't work because like Joe Biden, their ideas can't stand on their own. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1988.8s)]
*  It's not just the messaging, it's the message and the messengers and both suck. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=1994.0s)]
*  Why did Trump succeed? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2000.0s)]
*  People say he spoke with the vocabulary of a sixth grader. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2001.76s)]
*  True, because his ideas were solid. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2004.64s)]
*  You can't get more bare bones than this. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2007.52s)]
*  We're going to build a wall. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2010.64s)]
*  Sleepy Joe, the worst president in history. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2012.88s)]
*  There are only two genders, male and female. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2015.28s)]
*  Drill, baby, drill. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2021.52s)]
*  No, get those lights off. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  Turn off the lights. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2029.04s)]
*  Turn off the lights. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2031.2s)]
*  Tomorrow, oh, I'm going to come. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2032.96s)]
*  See, good ideas don't need fancy language. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2034.48s)]
*  Work hard. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2036.8s)]
*  Don't spend money you don't have. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2037.84s)]
*  Take care of your family and community and never turn your problems into someone else's. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2039.6s)]
*  And always, always delete your browser history. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2044.08s)]
*  Smart people say complicated things simply. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2048.8s)]
*  Arrogant people say dumb things in a complicated way. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2051.12s)]
*  And morons say things like, you're watching CNN. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2053.84s)]
*  So when you're watching CNN, you're watching CNN. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2059.04s)]
*  So when you hear terminology straight from the faculty lounge at Harvard, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2061.68s)]
*  you know the ideas are as deadly as Jerry Nadler's seat cushion. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2065.12s)]
*  So I really don't know how the Dems survive once they kill off their rhetoric. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2070.96s)]
*  Because once they take away the loony language of envy, power, and grievance, what's left? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2075.44s)]
*  It might be nothing or perhaps something worse. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2081.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2085.12s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2085.9199999999996s)]
*  Brooke, a pleasure to see you. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2091.68s)]
*  Thanks, darling. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2098.08s)]
*  And thank you for laughing at my Jewish joke. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2098.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I was going to say, I feel very marginalized and oppressed [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2100.72s)]
*  by your Holocaust and breast jokes. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2105.52s)]
*  I don't think this is a safe space for well-endowed Jewesses. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2108.72s)]
*  My truth is not your truth. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2113.9199999999996s)]
*  And the whole point of these ideological [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2115.9199999999996s)]
*  word salads, as you said in the beginning, is to avoid a real conversation. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2121.44s)]
*  So you don't have to engage in a conversation. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2125.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's almost become these ritualistic incantations. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2127.04s)]
*  And while the Democrats are taking a good look because they realize Americans are not dumb, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2132.08s)]
*  and we're not buying this anymore, it seeped into our culture. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2137.76s)]
*  And it's in movies. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  It's all over the Netflix. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2143.92s)]
*  It's in our schools. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2145.52s)]
*  Our K through 12 curriculums are seeped in this woke, progressive [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2147.28s)]
*  and they're still indoctrinating our children. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2153.12s)]
*  So we need a whole revamp of the educational system. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's not just the Democratic Party platform. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2160.0s)]
*  I actually think it's very, very scary and dangerous. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2162.08s)]
*  Well said. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2165.68s)]
*  See? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2166.48s)]
*  She did that using a first grade vocabulary. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2169.68s)]
*  So Mike, I've noticed something really weird. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2175.76s)]
*  I don't think the right has fancy jargon. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2178.56s)]
*  That actually, well, that's completely true. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2182.88s)]
*  And I actually think that's a strong suit because it makes you faithful to honesty. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2186.16s)]
*  You have to be honest because you don't have this sophisticated academic [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2191.84s)]
*  Jenga tower of BS to hide what you're doing. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2196.32s)]
*  And so it actually makes you less able to pull off slimy, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2198.8s)]
*  covert political operations because you can't dress stuff up. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  But it speaks to the voters. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2206.96s)]
*  And this is where we are now. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2208.56s)]
*  We're watching this mean girl scene play out where the Democrats are [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2209.7599999999998s)]
*  sad that fetch has not happened. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2213.9199999999996s)]
*  But it actually plays a key role in the operations that they do, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2216.72s)]
*  which is why I totally agree with what you said about [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2220.8799999999997s)]
*  if you think things are bad for them with this language, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2223.8399999999997s)]
*  imagine what happens when it goes away. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2226.96s)]
*  When the disinformation governance board came out, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2228.7999999999997s)]
*  that was the first time they called their censorship work. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2231.6s)]
*  Honestly, what it was disinformation governance. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2234.2400000000002s)]
*  DHS already had those operations run out of their cyber security [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2236.8s)]
*  and infrastructure security agency, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2242.0s)]
*  which is a name that puts you halfway to sleep before you finish saying it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2244.32s)]
*  And they define cyber security to include misinformation on the internet. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  But the moment they were honest about what it was, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2251.68s)]
*  public support collapse, congressional investigations, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2254.0s)]
*  nobody likes pedophiles. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2256.88s)]
*  But if you say minor attracted person, that does not, you know, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2258.56s)]
*  the problem is the pig. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2262.24s)]
*  You can't either saying, oh, we put cashmere on the pig. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2264.24s)]
*  We should dress it up in a silk dress. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2266.96s)]
*  Nobody likes criminals. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2268.96s)]
*  When you say justice involved person, you're still supporting criminals. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2270.16s)]
*  And so I think your point is exactly right. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2273.68s)]
*  They need this line. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2276.0s)]
*  It is so true. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2276.72s)]
*  It is like once you show it, you place the spotlight on like trans and sports. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2277.6s)]
*  Nobody liked it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2284.96s)]
*  So they had to talk about equity and equality and that these were real women. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2285.84s)]
*  And then you find out it's all. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2291.52s)]
*  Yeah. Once you translated the trans fabric, then all of a sudden you were like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2293.76s)]
*  what's left is a steaming pile of horse crap. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2298.7200000000003s)]
*  I find it so ironic to you guys because as an attorney, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2301.52s)]
*  you have to take these like continuing legal education courses, right? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, once a month, you have to sit down for an hour. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2307.36s)]
*  And usually it's a deep dive into some type of subject matter. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2309.36s)]
*  It's a specific criminal statute or something. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2312.08s)]
*  Are you doing that? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2314.08s)]
*  No, this month, this month, though, literally this week, it was words matter. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2314.96s)]
*  So they're forcing attorneys to sit down for an hour and listen to words matter. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2321.36s)]
*  And they say apply small language shifts to improve connections one word at a time [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2324.88s)]
*  because that whole legal bar is still stuck in the old days of knowing that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2330.56s)]
*  Well, if I say the wrong thing, if I say Indian instead of indigenous, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2335.52s)]
*  I'm going to get canceled. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2338.8s)]
*  If I say, sir, instead of ma'am, I'm going to get kicked out of Disneyland. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2340.0s)]
*  The ramifications were so real from the left because they canceled and expelled [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2343.44s)]
*  anyone who used the wrong word. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2348.0s)]
*  So not only can they not defend their ridiculous ideas using plain speak [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2350.4s)]
*  because the ideas are out of this world, but also if they dare to use any different words, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2354.48s)]
*  they were going to get kicked out. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2360.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had to use the approved language, Tyrus. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2361.28s)]
*  It is interesting. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2365.0400000000004s)]
*  Brooks said like they it prevents a real conversation. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2365.84s)]
*  I think that's deliberate because they lose every conversation. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2369.76s)]
*  Well, the Democratic Party can be best described as a woman who's a narcissist [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2372.48s)]
*  who claims to be on the spectrum. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2377.68s)]
*  They have all the bases covered. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2382.16s)]
*  You can't call them out on anything because it's not them. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2384.72s)]
*  It's the spec. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2387.52s)]
*  So we see that it's called reactive abuse is what the Democratic Party says. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2388.8s)]
*  They say a bunch of things, they do a bunch of things and it picks and prods at us. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWEwmniBJK0&t=2393.68s)]
