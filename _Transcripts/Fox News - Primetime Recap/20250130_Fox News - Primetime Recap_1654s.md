# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 29, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA)
*  Aha takes Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1.76s)]
*  First, he laid out the facts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=4.88s)]
*  My uncle was president, 3% of Americans were obese. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=8.24s)]
*  Today, 74% of Americans are obese or overweight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=13.08s)]
*  No other country has anything like this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=18.16s)]
*  In Japan, the obesity rate is still 3%. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=20.96s)]
*  And epidemics are not caused by genes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=25.28s)]
*  Genes may provide the vulnerability, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=29.12s)]
*  but you need an environmental toxin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Something is poisoning the American people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  A compellingly accurate opening statement by Trump's HHS secretary nominee, R.F.K. Jr. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=38.72s)]
*  Now, we can save countless lives and save billions in health care costs [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=44.72s)]
*  if we focus on Americans' health before they get sick. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=50.32s)]
*  And sick they are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=54.56s)]
*  Now, beyond the obvious scourge of obesity that he referenced there, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=55.92s)]
*  according to the latest figures, more than 38 million Americans have diabetes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  That's about 1 in 10. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=63.84s)]
*  And about 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=65.28s)]
*  Depression, that's been soaring, reaching new highs, nearly 29%. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=69.92s)]
*  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=74.8s)]
*  exceeded only by heart disease. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=77.6s)]
*  One in every five deaths in the U.S. is due to cancer. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, these numbers, and especially types of cancers that haven't really been hitting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=83.84s)]
*  young people to the extent that they are now, it's heartbreaking. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=88.4s)]
*  Now, much of this, we're going to learn, is entirely preventable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=92.16s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. wants Americans to get back to basics. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=96.4s)]
*  And he brushed off kind of the anti-vaxxer accusation pretty well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=100.16s)]
*  But Democrats, they never let the facts get in the way of a good smear operation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  The receipts show that Mr. Kennedy has embraced conspiracy theories, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=109.27999999999999s)]
*  quacks, charlatans. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  This is the profile of someone who chases money and influence wherever they lead, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  even if that may mean the tragic deaths of children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=126.72s)]
*  This is a job where it is life and death [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=130.48s)]
*  for the kids that I used to work for in the Denver public schools. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=134.64s)]
*  It's too important for the games that you're playing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=137.92s)]
*  And the Oscar for best actor in a political drama goes to Michael Bennett. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=141.76s)]
*  Now, seriously, if one had to diagnose the condition [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  afflicting today's Democrat Party, what would it be? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=151.76s)]
*  Because their minority status and President Trump's popularity, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  it's triggered their acute political psychosis. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy has questioned the scientific basis for germs causing disease [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=162.48s)]
*  and the power of vaccines and antibiotics. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=166.88s)]
*  I've never questioned that, Senator. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=168.88s)]
*  Well, I will submit that for the record. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=171.2s)]
*  Senator, you're asking me not to sue vaccine companies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=172.88s)]
*  No, I am not. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=176.88s)]
*  Yeah, you are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=178.32s)]
*  That's exactly what you're doing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, no one should be fooled here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Are you supportive of these onesies? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=184.16s)]
*  I'm supportive of vaccines. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=186.16s)]
*  Are you supportive of this clothing, which is high quality? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=187.68s)]
*  Which is militantly anti-vaccine? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=191.68s)]
*  I am supportive of vaccines. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders actually had him on my radio in my car today. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=198.32s)]
*  I think that blew my speaker on the passenger side. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=202.0s)]
*  It's just more ALH, angry liberal hyperbole. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=207.68s)]
*  The head of the HHS must believe in science and believe the experts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=212.56s)]
*  The first hundred people you'd find would be less dangerous at the head of HHS [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=219.36s)]
*  than Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=226.4s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. wants to conduct the Tuskegee experiments on all of us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=228.24s)]
*  I truly believe that if he runs HHS, that millions will die. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  Democrats colon, millions will die. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Look, the Democrats, they're in a quandary here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=244.56s)]
*  Because after years of claiming the mantle of the health care protectors, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=247.04s)]
*  they're now scrambling to take down the nomination of a true health care crusader, R.F.K. Jr. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=252.24s)]
*  Plus, let's face it, a party that holds a sacrosanct, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=258.88s)]
*  the genital mutilation of children, and the in utero mutilation of babies [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=261.92s)]
*  has zero credibility on protecting health and saving lives. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=267.52s)]
*  And I'm not even raising the COVID issue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=271.92s)]
*  Now, to be clear, R.F.K. Jr. is certainly not a conservative. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=274.64s)]
*  Not on a lot of the issues that I care about, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=278.24s)]
*  and he's never run a big institution before. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=279.92s)]
*  But since when has that ever bothered Democrats before in cabinet picks? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=282.8s)]
*  Can anyone say Mayor Pete? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=288.4s)]
*  Oh, South Bend is big though. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=291.68s)]
*  And what R.F.K. Jr. lacks in managerial experience, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  he makes up for with an unwavering dedication to improving America's spiraling health [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  with more common sense approaches. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=304.56s)]
*  Now that alone has helped galvanize millions of Americans into the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=307.12s)]
*  Maha movement, Make America Healthy Again movement. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=310.64s)]
*  And those people wonder why a country so rich with so many experts can be so unhealthy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=313.84s)]
*  What's at stake is American health. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  We can either continue along the path that we've been on, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=323.84s)]
*  or we can go a different way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=326.56s)]
*  And the way that R.F.K. Jr. is proposing is that we actually get to the root causes [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=327.84s)]
*  of this chronic disease epidemic that we're seeing that's impacting our children. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=332.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate that this has become such a political issue because [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=336.48s)]
*  R.F.K. has been appointed by Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=339.44s)]
*  There's a mass majority of Americans that want to see serious change in health. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=341.36s)]
*  And I think R.F.K. really helped. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=345.12s)]
*  We want him to make it easier for parents to shop for their families. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=347.04s)]
*  Yeah, parents want answers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=351.76s)]
*  They don't want more obfuscation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=353.6s)]
*  So industry experts, lobbyists that make huge money, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=356.24s)]
*  and they're paid by big pharma and big food, and of course our own government, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=361.2s)]
*  have all failed us in the health care arena. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=366.48s)]
*  So it's time for a fresh start. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=369.44s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=371.76s)]
*  What a time to be alive. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=372.56s)]
*  It was Kennedy's America and we were fit and healthy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=374.32s)]
*  Obesity was just 13%. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  60 years later, half the country's fat, sick, sad, and lonely. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  Our economy modernized and workers sit inside all day in front of screens. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=384.4s)]
*  Without sunlight and movement, we became depressed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=388.64s)]
*  So we ate our feelings. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  The more we ate, the more companies injected our food with addictive chemicals, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=393.52s)]
*  which made us eat more. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=397.44s)]
*  And our poor gut health impacted our mental health. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  As our bodies and minds deteriorated, doctors prescribed us pills. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=402.32s)]
*  So the sicker we got, the richer the food and drug industries got. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=406.4s)]
*  Insurance companies grew bigger and so did our government debt. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  Our children look like sumo wrestlers. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=413.68s)]
*  And the army can't recruit because no one can pass the cardio and push-up test. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=416.64s)]
*  Suicide rates and drug overdoses have hit all-time highs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=421.2s)]
*  Congratulations, America. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=425.28s)]
*  We're the sickest developed country on earth. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  People are happier, skinnier, and live longer in Panama, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  a country we're about to invade. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=434.0s)]
*  So they'll soon be as fat and sick as we are. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=436.08s)]
*  When we were skinny and healthy in the 60s, we didn't have diet coke. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Low-fat yogurt and sugar-free snacks. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=442.88s)]
*  They didn't even exercise in the 60s. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=445.76s)]

*  President Trump has promised to restore America's global strength [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  and to restore the American dream. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=534.16s)]

*  A healthy person has a thousand dreams. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=543.76s)]
*  A sick person has only one of the Make America Healthy Again movement. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=546.72s)]
*  This movement led largely by maha moms from every state. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=552.64s)]
*  You can see many of them behind us today and in the hallways and in the lobbies. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=556.8s)]
*  It is one of the most transcendent and powerful movements I've ever seen. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=562.88s)]
*  I will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=567.52s)]

*  RFK is like a public service announcement. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=599.68s)]
*  It's like what we did with cigarettes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=602.08s)]
*  No one banned smoking. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=603.84s)]
*  They just educated you on what it does to you. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=605.12s)]
*  And funny enough, the same companies that put addictive chemical additives into cigarettes [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=608.0s)]
*  also put it into food. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=613.6s)]

*  and the safest pharmaceuticals. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  And no one should lie to us about the science. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=621.36s)]

*  No, I'm asking you. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=645.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=646.8s)]
*  President Trump has asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=647.68s)]

*  Our 60% increase in Medicaid over the past four years [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=660.72s)]

*  Everybody in Washington has conflicts of interest, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=738.96s)]

*  from cyber attacks in their health care files? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=972.96s)]
*  I will. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=974.96s)]
*  I will commit not firing anybody who's doing their job. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=975.44s)]
*  Politicians are more worried about saving the jobs of bureaucrats [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=980.48s)]
*  than saving the lives of American children. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=983.52s)]
*  This issue is so much deeper than politics. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=986.08s)]
*  This is not just a economic issue. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  It's not just a national security issue. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=993.36s)]
*  It is a spiritual issue and it is a moral issue. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=995.36s)]
*  We cannot live up to our role as an exemplary nation, as a moral authority around the world. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=999.12s)]
*  And we're writing off an entire generation of kids. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats who always use kids as human shields for their policies. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1009.36s)]
*  Can't do this. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  Got to save the kids. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  Can't do that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  Got to protect the kids. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1015.2s)]
*  Suddenly they don't care about the kids. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1016.72s)]
*  You remember growing up your fourth grade class, maybe one kid headed inhaler, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1019.36s)]
*  maybe two or three kids were a little chunky? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1024.8s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1027.84s)]
*  When I launched my campaign, it was about uniting Americans, Democrats, and Republicans. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1030.0s)]
*  There's no issue that unites more than this chronic health epidemic. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1035.12s)]
*  There's no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1040.08s)]
*  These are our kids. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1044.08s)]
*  66% of them are damaged. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1046.08s)]
*  I know what a healthy kid looks like because I had so many of them in my family. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1048.72s)]
*  I didn't know anybody with a food allergy growing up, peanut allergy. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  Why do five of my kids have allergies? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1058.56s)]
*  By no means is Bobby Kennedy perfect. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1062.32s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1064.7199999999998s)]
*  He's had his demons. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1066.08s)]
*  He's said things. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1067.28s)]
*  We've all gone through stuff. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1068.08s)]
*  But some of our best leaders have flaws. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  RFK Jr. is the only one with the skills, knowledge, and experience to get inside of this government [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1072.7199999999998s)]
*  and help America reverse this chronic disease epidemic. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1077.52s)]
*  Our citizens voted to make America great and healthy again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1081.2800000000002s)]
*  RFK Jr. was a major part of this winning coalition. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1085.5200000000002s)]
*  His endorsement helped Donald Trump sweep the battlegrounds and win the popular vote. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1089.2800000000002s)]
*  He helped bring in Democrats, independents, and moms to the movement. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  This country is thirsty for radical change. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1098.16s)]
*  And if Democrats don't vote for Bobby, I get it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  It's Washington. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1102.64s)]
*  That happens. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  But if he doesn't get confirmed because of Republicans, then that's the real disease. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1104.0s)]
*  And let's just say it will make me deeply disappointed in them. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1110.72s)]
*  And they would never want to do anything to disappoint me. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1123.3600000000001s)]
*  And tonight, buckle up for another big interview. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1124.16s)]
*  Only hours ago, I traveled back to the DC swamp. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1126.72s)]
*  I sat down with the vice president, JD Vance. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1129.5200000000002s)]
*  We're going to bring you that exclusive interview in just a moment. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1132.16s)]
*  Also tonight, after Caroline Levitt's shock and awe debut, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1135.2s)]
*  a star was born in the White House briefing room. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1139.68s)]
*  All members of the state-run legacy media mob, they wasted no time launching their [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1142.88s)]
*  predictable vile attacks. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  Wait until you see what Joyless Behar, Whoopi Goldberg all had to say. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  And Caroline, she will join us with her response. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  That's straight ahead. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1157.44s)]
*  But first, President Trump, he just is just nonstop continuing to deliver on promise after [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1158.48s)]
*  promise after promise. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1165.68s)]
*  In this case, to secure our borders. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, he signed the Lakin Riley Act, surrounded by members of her loving family, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1168.96s)]
*  including her mother, who made a heart-wrenching statement. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1174.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1177.68s)]
*  Our family will forever be grateful for the prayers of the people across our nation [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1179.92s)]
*  and for helping to get this legislation into law. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1184.4s)]
*  We also want to thank President Trump for the promises he made to us. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1187.92s)]
*  He said he would secure our borders and that he would never forget about Lakin. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1192.64s)]
*  And he hasn't. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1198.96s)]
*  He's a man of his word. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1200.4s)]
*  We trust that he will fight for the American people. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1202.24s)]
*  Most importantly, I want to thank our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1208.16s)]
*  because without his sacrifices, Lakin's story would have ended on that horrific day [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1212.0s)]
*  that she was taken from us. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1216.88s)]
*  Where's Selena Gomez? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1220.24s)]
*  Where's that post? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  A beautiful tribute. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  A sad loss to a young woman's life. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1224.32s)]
*  Not only to an amazing young woman whose life was cut short by a Harris, Biden, Mayorkas, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1227.04s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrant, but also to all of the innocent Americans, all the Lakin Rylies, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1232.4s)]
*  all of the people that have been murdered, all the Americans that have been raped, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1239.04s)]
*  all the Americans that have been victims of violent crimes at the hands of these [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1243.2s)]
*  unvetted illegals. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1247.68s)]
*  You might not forget about 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungary, or that 13-year-old girl [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1249.52s)]
*  raped in broad daylight in a park in Queens, New York that was videotaped, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1254.24s)]
*  or that 37-year-old mother of five, Rachel Morin, whose young children, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1258.4s)]
*  they will never ever see their mother again. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1263.76s)]
*  Remember, these names, we scrolled these names all throughout the election. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1266.4s)]
*  Nobody else in the media talked about it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1271.28s)]
*  We did almost every night. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  And these are people, the names of people that were murdered and raped [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1275.28s)]
*  and victims of violent crime. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1278.64s)]
*  If you add up all the victims of these crimes at the hands of Harris, Biden, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1280.72s)]
*  unvetted illegals, the number is in the thousands. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1286.48s)]
*  And the blame for that is directly on Biden, Kamala Harris, and Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1290.24s)]
*  They all have, and I've said it before and I'll say it again, they have blood on their hands. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  And they lied to all of you. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1302.64s)]
*  They lied to the entire country. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1304.96s)]
*  And sadly, there will likely be more blood and even an attack on our homeland [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1307.28s)]
*  as a result of their failure by allowing known terrorists into the country. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1312.72s)]
*  But we don't know where they are. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1317.12s)]
*  For years, by the way, four years, they sat in their air-conditioned offices, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1318.96s)]
*  didn't bother to go down to the border, did nothing but lie to all of us [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1323.12s)]
*  while allowing a full-scale invasion at our southern border, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  the worst self-induced national security crisis by far in our country's history. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1332.24s)]
*  Thankfully, President Trump is following through on his promises to clean up this mess [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1338.72s)]
*  that the Biden White House left behind. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1345.12s)]
*  And during the signing of the Lake and Riley Act, he also announced an executive order [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1347.28s)]
*  allowing up to 30,000 of the most violent, criminal, illegal aliens to be sent to Gitmo. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1352.24s)]
*  But Trump didn't stop there. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1359.6s)]
*  He also signed an executive order pledging to cancel student visas [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1361.12s)]
*  for the pro-Hamas protesters who disrupted college campuses all across our country, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1365.52s)]
*  the virulent anti-Semitism we witnessed. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1371.1999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the effects of the president's crackdown on illegal immigration [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  are being felt all across the country. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1377.84s)]
*  In an early morning raid today, DEA agents arrested four suspects in Colorado [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1380.08s)]
*  with purported ties, you know, to one of these violent cartel gangs [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  and the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1390.32s)]
*  The arrest came just one day after federal law enforcement officials [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  conducted immigration raids in New York City. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  DEA agents said this critical operation would not have been possible [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1399.4399999999998s)]
*  without President Donald Trump's leadership. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  Now an alleged ringleader of that violent Tren de Aragua gang is off the streets. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1407.12s)]
*  And DHS Secretary Kristianos was there when it happened [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  and has now revealed he was trying to buy grenades. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1416.1599999999999s)]
*  And thanks to Biden and Harris and Mayorkas, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1420.0s)]
*  this is likely the tip of the iceberg. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1423.2s)]
*  This will be their long-term legacy. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1425.36s)]
*  But in the meantime, thankfully, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1428.0s)]
*  he is launching an investigation asking sanctuary city mayors [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1432.16s)]

*  How many times on this show have we said they're aiding, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1439.28s)]
*  they're abetting the law breaking, they're helping in human trafficking. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1441.44s)]
*  And as borders are, Tom Homan said, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1445.2s)]
*  local politicians who obstruct the mass deportations, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1447.6s)]
*  they themselves could face charges. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1452.8799999999999s)]
*  But predictably many on the left wing and the left wing state-run media mob [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1455.28s)]
*  and Democrats, once again, they go back to their tried and true nine-year-old mantra. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1459.36s)]
*  Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, fascist, racist, Nazi. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1465.6799999999998s)]
*  This is what the Democrats and the state-run legacy media mob have become. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1471.28s)]
*  This is who they have been now for 10 years. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1475.76s)]
*  Just take a look at how they conducted themselves [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1479.04s)]
*  during RFK's confirmation hearing from earlier today. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1481.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1484.48s)]
*  There's no issue that's united us more than this chronic health epidemic. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1486.0s)]
*  There's no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1490.96s)]
*  These are our kids. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1494.96s)]
*  66% of them are damaged. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1496.96s)]
*  I don't think anybody is going to be able to do this like I have. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1499.6s)]
*  Because of my peculiar experience, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1504.88s)]
*  because I've litigated against these agencies, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1508.32s)]
*  when you litigate against them, you get a PhD in corporate capture. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1510.64s)]
*  And how to unravel it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1514.08s)]
*  I've written six books about these agencies. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1516.24s)]
*  I know a lot about them and I know how to fix it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1519.84s)]
*  And there's nobody who will fix it the way that I do [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1522.56s)]
*  because I'm not scared of vested interest. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1526.48s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1528.96s)]
*  He did an amazing job on Capitol Hill. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1531.36s)]
*  Just like all the other cabinet officials that went before the US Senate, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1533.44s)]
*  they didn't really lay a glove on them. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1537.68s)]
*  They're just angry. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1539.28s)]
*  Despite spending more money on health care than any other country in the world, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1540.4s)]
*  the overall health and well-being of the American people is not in a good place. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1543.76s)]
*  President Trump, RFK, no, we can't be strong if our people are all sick. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1548.48s)]
*  But the Democrats at today's hearing must have missed the memo [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1553.52s)]
*  because they acted like a group of overgrown, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1556.88s)]
*  petulant children throwing a temper tantrum. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1559.52s)]
*  And at one point, Bernie Sanders screaming about baby onesies. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1562.48s)]
*  Can't make this up. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1568.3200000000002s)]
*  Will you commit not to fire anyone in the health arena [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1570.16s)]
*  who currently works on protecting Americans from cyber attacks in their health care files? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1575.2800000000002s)]
*  I will. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1579.8400000000001s)]

*  You're asking me, Senator, you're asking me not to pursue vaccine. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1614.8s)]
*  No, I am not. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOdZod0R2VA&t=1619.2s)]
