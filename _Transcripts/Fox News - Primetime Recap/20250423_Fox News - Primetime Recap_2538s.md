# Fox News Highlights - April 22nd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM)
*  Parents say no to woke insanity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=3.2s)]
*  Donald Trump promised to make America great again, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=5.5s)]
*  but he wasn't just talking about the economy or our health. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=10.8s)]
*  Public education also needs rescuing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=14.0s)]
*  Sex and gender radicals, we know they're working overtime [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  to sideline parents, subvert their authority, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  and keep them in the dark, if at all possible, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  about what their kids are learning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=27.5s)]
*  But today at the Supreme Court, a case out of the far left [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  Montgomery County, Maryland, should give us hope [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=33.9s)]
*  that slowly but surely, we may be reclaiming [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=36.9s)]
*  the high ground in our schools. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=40.4s)]
*  First, understand this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=43.1s)]
*  Montgomery County, Maryland school board members [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=44.2s)]
*  think that parents have no right, none, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=47.2s)]
*  to object to their children being exposed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  to sexually inappropriate, most would say deviant, materials. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=53.8s)]
*  Second, liberal parents love having their sons and daughters [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  steeped in this filth, but the parents objecting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  are actually themselves a diverse group. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=66.6s)]
*  Hundreds of parents complained, mostly families [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=70.2s)]
*  from Muslim faith and Ethiopian Orthodox [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=74.0s)]
*  who were objecting when they spoke to the board. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=78.0s)]
*  The board accused them of using their religious beliefs [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=80.8s)]
*  as another reason to hate, accused a young Muslim girl [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=84.1s)]
*  of parroting her parents' dogma, and then accused the parents [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=88.6s)]
*  of aligning with racist xenophobes and white supremacists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=92.7s)]
*  Okay, this is sick stuff. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=97.7s)]
*  By the way, do you think those folks came legally [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=100.1s)]
*  from their homeland to come here to have their kids [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=103.6s)]
*  taught like that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=107.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=108.8s)]
*  That's not what they thought they were getting in America. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=109.7s)]
*  But the books in this curriculum are for, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=112.7s)]
*  remember, kindergarten through fifth grade. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  To give you an idea what five-year-olds [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=118.3s)]
*  in Montgomery County are learning, look no further [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=119.7s)]
*  than Pride Puppy, about a dog going to the pride parade [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=121.8s)]
*  with its family. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=126.2s)]
*  At the end of the book, there's even a search [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=127.2s)]
*  and find word list. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=129.3s)]
*  It includes the words intersex, drag queens, lace, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=131.1s)]
*  and leather, lovely. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=135.1s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh today pressed the Montgomery County attorney [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=137.1s)]
*  about why they simply didn't allow students to opt out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=140.3s)]
*  Every other school board in the country has opt-outs [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=144.5s)]
*  for all sorts of things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  The county has opt-outs for all sorts of things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  The other Maryland counties have opt-outs [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=151.5s)]
*  for all sorts of things. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=153.4s)]
*  And yet for this one thing, they changed in mid-year [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  and say no more opt-outs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm just not understanding feasibility. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  With respect to these books as they were deployed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  in the classroom, there was high absenteeism in some schools. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  For example, dozens of students being opted out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=169.4s)]
*  I love saying the books deployed, but that's it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, they force total compliance, no opt-out, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=177.4s)]
*  because total indoctrination is their goal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  Montgomery County offers a free public education to parents [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  only if their children use books featuring same-sex relationships [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=190.6s)]
*  and transgender issues. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=194.3s)]
*  That burdens parents of multiple faiths [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=196.0s)]
*  whose religious duty is to shield their young children [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=198.6s)]
*  from such content. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=201.5s)]
*  100% right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=204.5s)]
*  But congratulations, Montgomery County. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=205.8s)]
*  You're now known as the religious bigotry capital [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=207.9s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=211.4s)]
*  You're so intolerant, you even lost Justice Kagan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=212.4s)]
*  I, too, was struck by these are, you know, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=215.9s)]
*  young kids, picture books, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=219.6s)]
*  and on matters concerning sexuality. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=221.2s)]
*  I suspect there are a lot of non-religious parents [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=225.4s)]
*  who weren't all that thrilled about this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=227.9s)]
*  And then you, you know, add in religion, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=229.9s)]
*  and that's, you know, even more serious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=232.6s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this case isn't even close. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=240.4s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=242.8s)]
*  The ruling should be 9-0 in favor of the parents. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=243.4s)]
*  But then again, the Constitution, religious liberty, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=246.6s)]
*  parental rights, they don't seem to matter as much [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=249.3s)]
*  to certain justices who sound like they're frustrated [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=253.1s)]
*  by MSNBC pundits. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=256.5s)]
*  The parent can choose to put their kid elsewhere. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=257.9s)]
*  You don't have to send your kid to public school. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=262.2s)]
*  I'm struggling to see how it burdens [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=265.1s)]
*  a parent's religious exercise [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=267.5s)]
*  if the school teaches something [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=269.6s)]
*  that the parent disagrees with. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=272.4s)]
*  You have a choice. You can homeschool them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=274.2s)]
*  Okay, it sounds like Justice Jackson, God bless her, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=277.5s)]
*  studied a different con law than I did in law school. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=280.7s)]
*  I'm not sure what she studied. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=283.4s)]
*  It's unconscionable that a sitting Supreme Court justice [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  would contend that it is constitutionally permissible [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=289.3s)]
*  to penalize Christian or Muslim parents [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  for exercising their religious liberty rights. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=296.8s)]
*  Go private. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=299.8s)]
*  That is the smug response on my local parenting blog [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=301.6s)]
*  to parents who cannot, in good conscience, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=305.8s)]
*  risk their children being taught lessons about sexuality [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=309.1s)]
*  that violate their most fundamental religious beliefs. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=313.0s)]
*  The board has essentially told us [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  that we do not get a final say in our children's education. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  No notice, no consent, no choice. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=324.9s)]
*  These mothers are awesome, by the way. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=329.2s)]
*  Congratulations for having the guts to speak out. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=331.7s)]
*  But it gets a lot worse because these leftists [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=335.7s)]
*  are trying to intimidate other parents [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=338.0s)]
*  from resisting their school's sexual propaganda. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=339.9s)]
*  Because the sense is you oppose them [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=343.4s)]
*  and they're going to somehow maybe even take it out on your kids. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=347.2s)]
*  Maybe kid won't get a recommendation [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=349.7s)]
*  to go on to the next school. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=351.2s)]
*  Or they're just going to paint you as a cruel anti-rainbow hater. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  There are kids who go home to rainbow families [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  showing the beautiful diversity that exists. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=361.9s)]
*  And we know that a number of our kids are LGBTQ+. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=364.6s)]
*  And the reality that we're talking about today [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=370.1s)]
*  is people want to erase us from books. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=372.5s)]
*  They want to erase us from existing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  And are we going to let them erase us? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  No, we are not. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  There's not an eraser big enough, okay? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=385.8s)]
*  These people should not be allowed anywhere near [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  children or education. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=393.0s)]
*  Not only because they don't respect parents' rights, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=394.9s)]
*  because they're also really dumb. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=397.5s)]
*  People don't live just one lives. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=399.4s)]
*  They have many identities that intersect. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=401.1s)]
*  And we must look at this interconnectedness of people's race, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=403.9s)]
*  gender, sexual orientation, disability, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=407.8s)]
*  religion, immigration status, and more. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=410.4s)]
*  When we teach lessons and we share beliefs, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=413.1s)]
*  we must do so to bring people together and not divide them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=416.1s)]
*  Our schools need to be places of joy, safety, and visibility. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=420.2s)]
*  For all! [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=425.9s)]
*  Oh, visibility. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=428.4s)]
*  Ah, be an ally. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=430.5s)]
*  Look, there's nothing safe about learning [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=432.5s)]
*  with these people in charge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=434.3s)]
*  American history, Western civilization, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=436.2s)]
*  the great works, human biology. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  They want the truth buried and replaced by their warped worldview [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  where children are treated like sexual silly putty [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=447.6s)]
*  to be molded by teachers who can undo the damage [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=450.3s)]
*  done by traditional parents. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=453.7s)]
*  And by the way, all their platitudes they mouth about diversity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=456.3s)]
*  But what they really demand is conformity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=460.5s)]
*  No child should be shielded from the reality of human diversity. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=464.3s)]
*  To allow students to opt out of learning about people [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=474.5s)]
*  different from themselves is to teach them that ignorance is a virtue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=477.9s)]
*  A diverse education is not indoctrination. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=482.5s)]
*  It is illumination. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=486.3s)]
*  Oh my goodness, is that painful? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=490.0s)]
*  Well, from the sound of things at oral arguments today, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=491.6s)]
*  and you can never totally predict, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=494.1s)]
*  but it seems like a majority of justices aren't buying any of this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=495.2s)]
*  And when the court's decision is handed down in June, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=498.8s)]
*  you should expect the usual eruptions from all the usual suspects [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=501.8s)]
*  who somehow landed jobs in schools. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=505.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=508.7s)]
*  The prognosis is in. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  50% of the people in the world have Trump derangement syndrome [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=513.3s)]
*  and they still have a really hard time understanding [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=517.8s)]
*  why he's back in the White House. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=520.4s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=521.9s)]
*  He was elected with a majority. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=524.2s)]
*  Let's get over the derangement syndrome. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=526.1s)]
*  Let's focus on the policy and get stuff done [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=527.7s)]
*  because I've got to tell you, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=530.7s)]
*  there's a lot of people that go out of their minds. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Wonderful should have been a doctor [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=535.0s)]
*  because he just accurately diagnosed half the globe as cuckoo. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  And if you've ever been around someone crazy, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=540.7s)]
*  you know there's nothing you can do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=542.9000000000001s)]
*  Crazy's going to crazy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=544.6s)]
*  You can't let it affect you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=546.2s)]
*  So when I hear Al Gore say he's living under the Third Reich, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=548.6s)]
*  he must really believe that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=552.1s)]
*  because he believes he invented the internet. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=553.7s)]
*  I understand very well why it is wrong [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=557.2s)]
*  to compare Adolf Hitler's Third Reich to any other movement. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=559.4s)]
*  It was uniquely evil, full stop. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=565.6s)]
*  But there are important lessons from the history [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=567.1s)]
*  of that emergent evil [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  and here is one that I regard as essential. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=570.5s)]
*  The Nazis, and I quote again, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=573.0s)]
*  attacked the very heart of the distinction [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=574.6s)]
*  between true and false. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration is insisting [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  on trying to create their own preferred version of reality. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=582.4s)]
*  Al Gore and the people like him can't accept that Trump won. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=587.3s)]
*  And the reality is he's president again. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=590.8s)]
*  And Gore never was. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  Trump's living in reality. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=597.0999999999999s)]
*  He's living in the White House. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  He preferred that version and made it a reality. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=602.0s)]
*  It's people like Gore who can't accept reality, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=605.4s)]
*  who can't accept that Trump won. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=608.3s)]
*  And that's where we are today. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=611.0s)]
*  These people have convinced themselves [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=613.1s)]
*  that when they're not in power, they're gonna die. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=615.4s)]
*  Or if you don't do what they tell you to do, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=618.7s)]
*  like buy an electric car, you're gonna die. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=621.1s)]
*  But nobody's dying. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=624.4s)]
*  They never do. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=625.8s)]
*  So even though we can't change crazy, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=627.4s)]
*  we can tell them to chill. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=629.9s)]
*  Some in our leadership class seem stricken by self-doubt [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=632.4s)]
*  and even fear of the future. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=635.7s)]
*  To them, humanity is always one bad decision [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=638.0s)]
*  away from catastrophe. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=640.9s)]
*  The world will soon end, they tell us, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=642.8s)]
*  because we're burning too much fuel [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=644.4s)]
*  or making too many things or having too many children. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=646.6s)]
*  And so rather than invest in the future, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=649.9s)]
*  they too often retreat from it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=652.8s)]
*  Well, President Trump rejects these failed ideas. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=654.4s)]
*  When a crazy guy comes up to you [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=658.8s)]
*  and says something bad's about to happen, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  you don't take him seriously. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=662.5s)]
*  You say, I'm sorry. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  You slowly back away. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=666.6s)]
*  But when half the world is screaming [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=668.7s)]
*  something bad's gonna happen, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=670.2s)]
*  you can't let yourself get worked up. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  You just have to learn to live with these people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  You learn to live with crazy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=678.3000000000001s)]
*  The stock market was up a thousand points today. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=680.7s)]
*  But they keep saying we're on the brink of a recession. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=683.4s)]
*  Well, the CEO of Chevron, kind of a big deal, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=686.6s)]
*  says no, we're not. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=690.0s)]
*  We're not even close. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=691.1s)]
*  You don't think we're headed into a recession [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=693.4s)]
*  in your plans at this point? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=695.2s)]
*  You know, there's no signs that we see at this point [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=696.5s)]
*  that we're in or close to a recession. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=699.3s)]
*  They said the world was gonna side with China [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=702.6s)]
*  and China was gonna eat our lunch. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=704.7s)]
*  No one wins a trade war, they said. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=706.9s)]
*  So why are all these countries flying here [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=710.1s)]
*  to do deals with us? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=711.7s)]
*  You have the entire trade team meeting [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=714.0s)]
*  with 34 countries this week alone. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=716.2s)]
*  We are moving at Trump's speed [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=719.2s)]
*  to ensure these deals are made on behalf [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=721.0s)]
*  of the American worker and the American people. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=723.8s)]
*  34 countries. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=725.8s)]
*  Well, they say China's the big kahuna. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=727.3s)]
*  They have a billion people. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=729.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, we just found a billion more. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  We're especially excited to formally announce [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=736.0s)]
*  that America and India have officially finalized [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=738.8s)]
*  the terms of reference for the trade negotiation. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  I think this is a vital step. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, they say we are living in Nazi Germany, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=747.0999999999999s)]
*  so how do you explain all these countries [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=748.9s)]
*  flying here to have lunch and invest? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  Is India a Nazi collaborator? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=753.2s)]
*  See what I mean? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=756.5s)]
*  The Europeans just announced [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=758.1s)]
*  a $50 billion manufacturing investment here. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=759.5s)]
*  12,000 jobs made in America. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=762.7s)]
*  Does that sound like a recession? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=765.6s)]
*  Is that chaotic? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=767.6s)]
*  Maybe the process can seem chaotic to some people [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=769.9000000000001s)]
*  because it's never been done before, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=773.1s)]
*  but the results aren't. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=775.0s)]
*  Trump's the first president in 40 years [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=777.1s)]
*  to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  Democrats are jealous that he's doing things [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=781.1s)]

*  That's what's making him crazy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=786.5s)]
*  Their dirty little playbook was to say [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=789.2s)]
*  they were gonna do stuff, never do it, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=791.1s)]
*  and then just keep running on it again and again and again [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=793.3000000000001s)]
*  so they can be politicians for life [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  and get rich insider trading and taking half the week off. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=799.5s)]
*  But Trump's fixing the problems and finding their fraud, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=803.6s)]
*  so the jig's up. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=807.0s)]
*  And when they say the world's gonna end, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  yeah, their world's ending. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=810.6s)]
*  Their reality's over. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=813.4s)]
*  And they never thought it would happen. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=815.9s)]
*  So they're having a hard time coming to grips with reality. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=817.8s)]
*  Clinical psychiatrists call this a psychotic break [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=821.5s)]
*  when you sever yourself from reality [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=825.2s)]
*  and live in a different world [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=827.4s)]
*  that you've created in your own mind. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=828.9s)]
*  These are the people we're dealing with. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=831.6s)]
*  They said we couldn't just shut down the border [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=834.2s)]
*  without Congress, remember? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=836.1s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=837.8s)]
*  He did it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=839.0s)]
*  And we just saw the lowest border crossings [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=840.4s)]
*  in the history of March. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=842.5s)]
*  They're down 99.9% from Joe. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=844.1s)]
*  The White House says you can't get much better than that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=848.3s)]
*  Trump's proving that the president has more power [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=851.8s)]
*  than they wanted you to know. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=854.8s)]
*  And they're terrified next time they're in power, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=856.6999999999999s)]
*  voters are gonna expect more. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, Trump did it, why can't you? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=861.8s)]
*  Trump closed the border, cut trade deals, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=864.1s)]
*  lowered gas prices, slashed waste. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=865.9s)]
*  Why can't you? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=868.3s)]
*  Voters are gonna expect results now. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=870.4s)]
*  And the crazy people who usually run the show [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=873.1s)]
*  don't want voters expecting results [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=875.9s)]
*  because that means voters are gonna judge them. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=878.1s)]
*  And politicians, they like to be the judge. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=881.1s)]
*  Once you flip it on them, it's game over. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=884.3s)]
*  They're all about debating the process. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=887.3s)]
*  It's gotta be done this way. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  No, it has to be done this way. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=891.1s)]
*  Oh, we're gonna sue, no, we're gonna have a commission, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  we're gonna have legislation. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=894.1s)]
*  That keeps everybody arguing and distracted and lawyered up. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=896.4s)]
*  Why do you think they're flying to El Salvador [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=900.8s)]
*  to undeport MS-13? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=902.6999999999999s)]
*  Even though he ended up out of the country, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  they didn't like the process. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=908.1s)]
*  The El Salvador four are still down there [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=911.4s)]
*  waiting to get margaritas with a gang member. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  But he's in jail because he's a gang member. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=916.9s)]
*  So now they're just doing CNN hits from the hotel. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=920.4s)]
*  Why did you feel it was important [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=924.3s)]
*  to travel to El Salvador now? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=926.0s)]
*  Well, the main thing is that in this country, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=928.5s)]
*  everybody is entitled to due process. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=930.5999999999999s)]
*  This is bigger than just Gilmore Garcia. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  This is about due process in the United States. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=934.9s)]
*  Due process is not an optional. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=936.8s)]
*  That is a must right in the United States of America. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=940.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is following the same authoritarian playbook [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  as others around the world [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=946.3s)]
*  and by just not following the law. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=947.8s)]
*  The El Salvador four don't care about due process. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=951.0999999999999s)]
*  They just want to slow down the process. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=953.3s)]
*  Trump deported these bad hombres so fast [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=956.8s)]
*  that it's making Democrats look feckless. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=959.4s)]
*  So they want every illegal alien gang member [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=962.0999999999999s)]
*  to get a lawyer, a hearing, and a year of appeals at least. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  And then they want to make Trump look like [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=968.0999999999999s)]
*  he's breaking the law. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=969.8s)]
*  Remember, that's what they tried the last election [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=971.4s)]
*  and it didn't work. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  What's the definition of insanity? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=974.9s)]
*  Trying the same thing over and over again [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=977.0s)]
*  and expecting a different result. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=978.8s)]
*  Barack Obama deported three million illegals. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=981.4s)]
*  No one called him a dictator and no one said citizens are next. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=985.0999999999999s)]
*  Obama's people didn't even think it was controversial. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=989.5s)]
*  Will this administration continue to oversee [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=993.5s)]
*  the deportation of 400,000 people a year? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=995.8s)]
*  As long as Congress gives us the money [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  to deport 400,000 people a year, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1000.0999999999999s)]
*  that's what the administration is going to do. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1002.0s)]
*  That's our obligation under the law. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1003.5s)]
*  We will be strategic about how we do it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1005.4s)]
*  And the number of those folks who are either criminals [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1008.3s)]
*  or recent arrivals will continue to go up. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1011.1s)]
*  But yes, this is our obligation under the law. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1014.4s)]
*  We must enforce it and we will do that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1016.9s)]
*  Barack Obama drone-striked an American citizen overseas. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1019.7s)]
*  What has more due process? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1025.4s)]
*  Your president murdering you with a missile without a hearing [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1027.1s)]
*  or your president flying an illegal alien home? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1030.5s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1034.3s)]
*  But what happens when you stand next to a crazy person? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1036.2s)]
*  You look good. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1039.2s)]
*  You don't even have to do anything except not act crazy. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1040.7s)]
*  And the funny thing about crazy people [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1043.9s)]
*  is that they don't know they're crazy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1045.9s)]
*  So Republicans are offering to pay for any Democrat [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1048.2s)]
*  who wants to go to El Salvador. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1051.0s)]
*  Just one condition. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  They have to live stream the whole thing [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1054.9s)]
*  and snap plenty of selfies. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1057.0s)]
*  It's like handing a crazy person an iPhone. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1059.8s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1062.2s)]
*  but you're going to laugh. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1063.6000000000001s)]
*  And the so-called smart Democrats, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, the strategists, they're all in. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1067.8999999999999s)]
*  They say, let's all go to El Salvador. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1071.3s)]
*  Deep breath, deep breath. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1075.8999999999999s)]
*  Going to try not to scream about all of this, but just... [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1077.2s)]
*  I'm going to scream about it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1079.5s)]
*  Okay, good. Good. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1080.7s)]
*  Thank you, because I can't anymore. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1082.0s)]
*  My head's going to pop off my body. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1084.1s)]
*  I'm like, I'm so pulsing with rage right now over this. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  It's like, if we are not willing to stand up here, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  then I don't know what we are fighting for [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1094.8999999999999s)]
*  or what we stand for or who we are. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1096.2s)]
*  This never happened when Nancy was in charge. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1098.1s)]
*  She wouldn't let her members fly to foreign countries [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  for photo ops with MS-13. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1102.5s)]
*  The guy has MS-13 tatted on his knuckles. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1105.1s)]
*  Even Nancy knows better than that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1108.5s)]
*  She had everybody disciplined. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1111.0s)]
*  And if you got out of the line, she'd cut your throat. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1112.5s)]
*  Now Hakeem's running the show, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1115.6s)]
*  and he's afraid of his own base. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1116.8999999999999s)]
*  So the base is out of control. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1119.8s)]
*  AOC's beefing with Federman Dave Hogg, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1121.7s)]
*  scrapping with Carville. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1124.1s)]
*  Colleagues are trying to coup Schumer. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1126.3s)]
*  If Al Green had shaken that cane at Trump, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1129.1000000000001s)]
*  and Nancy was there, she would have grabbed it [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1132.2s)]
*  and broke his kneecaps. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1133.9s)]
*  She'd never tolerate Jasmine Crockett [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  and her little shenanigans. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1137.7s)]
*  Pelosi was the psych warden, kept all these kooks in line. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1139.5s)]
*  And unlike the first term, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1144.7s)]
*  Trump's not even bothering with these people. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  He's focused on the big stuff, like peace, trade, and borders, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1148.3s)]
*  and letting the results speak for themselves. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1151.9s)]
*  We're going to go to the Fox News YouTube page [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1156.3s)]
*  to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1158.7s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1162.0s)]
*  But we begin with Chuck Schumer praising Donald Trump. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1164.1000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1167.5s)]
*  I was born in Brooklyn, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1169.1000000000001s)]
*  the same place where Donald Trump's family comes from. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1170.5s)]
*  His father and my grandfather [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1173.7s)]
*  were builders together in Brooklyn. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1178.7s)]
*  Even when he was much younger, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1179.7s)]
*  you knew that he was going to go places. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1181.1000000000001s)]
*  Schumer and Mr. Trump are good friends. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1183.5s)]
*  They both have a passion for life, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1186.1000000000001s)]
*  and you get that immediately, talking to him. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1187.7s)]
*  Obviously, a few years ago, before Trump was president, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1191.1000000000001s)]
*  but he was kind of right. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1193.9s)]
*  Now, Schumer has nothing nice to say. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1195.4s)]
*  He's already at his lowest popularity rate in New York state, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1197.5s)]
*  according to the just-released Sienna poll out today. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1201.5s)]
*  AOC, by the way, on the rise big time. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1204.9s)]
*  So, question tonight is, are Chuck's days numbered? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1207.7s)]
*  But if there is one constant in the Democratic Party, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1211.6s)]
*  it's that they don't really truly believe in anything. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1215.0s)]
*  Everything they say, everything they do, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1218.8s)]
*  is about their own political power. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1221.2s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1222.9s)]
*  In 2017, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1224.5s)]
*  bashed Trump on Twitter. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1228.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1230.0s)]
*  Saying, quote, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1230.5s)]
*  we should be focused on deporting MS-13, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1231.6s)]
*  not scholarship winners. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1235.9s)]
*  That's the same guy that last week, you know, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1237.6s)]
*  went to visit the deported, suspected MS-13 gang member [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1240.1999999999998s)]
*  to bring him back to this country. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1244.1999999999998s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen threw a fit, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1246.8s)]
*  even got on that plane to El Salvador, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1249.1999999999998s)]
*  demanding his immediate return. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1251.1999999999998s)]
*  That would be political grandstanding at its worst. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  And this is the same Chris Van Hollen, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1256.3999999999999s)]
*  couldn't even pick up a telephone [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1258.6999999999998s)]
*  and speak with the families of young women [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1260.1s)]
*  who were raped and murdered in his state [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1262.3s)]
*  by unvetted, illegal immigrants. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  And just yesterday, another illegal immigrant [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1268.3s)]
*  was charged with the murder of a 23-year-old woman [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  whose body was found in a Maryland forest. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1274.4s)]
*  Will he pick up the phone now? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1277.4s)]
*  But we have yet to see any kind of hysteria [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1279.1000000000001s)]
*  from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1281.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he's just very worn out. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  He's probably very tired from his big trip to El Salvador. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1285.8s)]
*  But the hypocrisy doesn't end there. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1289.3s)]
*  Let's go to Earth Day. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1291.7s)]
*  Of course, Al Gore, forcing his way [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1293.7s)]
*  back into the spotlight, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1296.9s)]
*  this time he is honoring our planet [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1298.5s)]
*  by comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1301.3000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1304.3000000000002s)]
*  I understand very well why it is wrong [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1305.9s)]
*  to compare Adolf Hitler's Third Reich [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1308.1000000000001s)]
*  to any other movement. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1310.2s)]
*  It was uniquely evil, full stop. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1312.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1314.3000000000002s)]
*  But there are important lessons [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1315.8000000000002s)]
*  from the history of that emergent evil. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1317.3000000000002s)]
*  But it was Habermas's mentor, Theodore Adorno, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1319.2s)]
*  who wrote that the first step [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1323.8s)]
*  in that nation's descent into hell was, and I quote, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1326.9s)]
*  the conversion of all questions of truth [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1331.9s)]
*  into questions of power. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1335.7s)]
*  He described how the Nazis, and I quote again, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1339.7s)]
*  attacked the very heart of the distinction [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1342.1000000000001s)]
*  between true and false, end quote. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1345.3s)]
*  The Trump administration is insisting [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1350.0s)]
*  on trying to create their own preferred version of reality. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1352.6s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, I shouldn't compare people to Hitler, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1359.3999999999999s)]
*  but I'll do it anyway. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1361.1s)]
*  Now, just like most of his other colleagues [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1362.3s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1364.5s)]
*  Al Gore is a complete fraud and hypocrite. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1365.8999999999999s)]
*  He's like the original climate hysteria [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  hypocrite of all time. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1374.6s)]
*  Everything he says is a ploy to get money and power. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1375.8999999999999s)]
*  So tonight, time for a quick Hannity history lesson. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  I promise you're not going to hear it [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1382.3s)]
*  anywhere else in the media. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1383.5s)]
*  Let's go back to 2007. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1385.0s)]
*  That same guy, Al Gore, warned of a planetary emergency. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1386.8999999999999s)]
*  He said the planet has a fever [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1391.8s)]
*  and that humanity could soon be in peril. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1394.0s)]
*  That, of course, was false. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  In 2009, Gore said that 75% of the entire polar ice cap [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1399.0s)]
*  will melt in the next five to seven years. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1403.3999999999999s)]
*  That was also totally false. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1406.8s)]
*  By 2015, the ice caps even expanded in many areas. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1408.6999999999998s)]
*  He also warned about the extinction of the coral reefs. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1412.8s)]
*  Whoops, but in 2019, the reefs grew by 2%. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1416.0s)]
*  This came after decades of dire, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1419.5s)]
*  varying claims about climate change, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1421.8999999999999s)]
*  climate cooling, climate warming. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1424.6999999999998s)]
*  Then, you know, if it snows, you have an excuse. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1426.8s)]
*  If it doesn't snow, if there's an earthquake, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1429.3s)]
*  if there's not an earthquake, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1431.1999999999998s)]
*  if there's a hurricane, if there's not a hurricane, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1432.3s)]
*  always have an excuse for something. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1434.6s)]
*  Now, this came after years of wild claims [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1436.6s)]
*  about climate change. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1438.5s)]
*  Let's take you back to 1975. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1439.8s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1441.9s)]
*  That's Newsweek. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1442.8s)]
*  They predicted a cooling world [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1444.0s)]
*  with an ice age by the mid-1980s. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1446.0s)]
*  Obviously, they were wrong. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1449.0s)]
*  In 1995, The New York Times reported [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1450.2s)]
*  that beaches on the east coast of the US [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1453.0s)]
*  would be wiped out by 2021, four years ago. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1455.5s)]
*  In 2006, Time Magazine claimed [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1459.5s)]
*  that the Earth was at a tipping point [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1462.3s)]
*  and that we all should be very, very worried. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1464.7s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1467.5s)]
*  Democrats, they never actually believed that. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1468.8s)]
*  Al Gore, of all people, look at this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1471.5s)]
*  This was a Hannity exclusive video. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1474.3s)]
*  Film jetting all over the country in a private jet. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1476.2s)]
*  That jet seats about 14, 16 people. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1480.0s)]
*  There's only two people on it and the pilots. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1482.9s)]
*  So the same thing with Biden's climates are. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1485.4s)]
*  John Kerry, I need important work [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1488.2s)]
*  and I need to get there quickly. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1491.2s)]
*  That's why I get to take a private jet [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1492.6999999999998s)]
*  and I want you to get rid of your SUV. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1494.8999999999999s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1497.3s)]
*  Just this week. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1498.3s)]
*  I love this. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1499.3s)]
*  AOC, Bernie Sanders. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1500.6s)]
*  Look at him right there. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1502.8999999999999s)]
*  That's a nice plane they're getting out of there. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1503.8999999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1505.5s)]
*  They were filming stepping off their private jet. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1506.3s)]
*  I'm not against private jets [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1508.8999999999999s)]
*  but don't lecture everybody about their SUVs [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1510.1s)]
*  or their caravans for crying out loud. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  And remember in 2019, it was AOC claiming [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1514.6999999999998s)]
*  that the world was going to end in 12 years. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1517.8999999999999s)]
*  Why? Because of rising CO2 levels. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1522.0s)]
*  But now she's riding around leaving a huge carbon footprint [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  with a private jet for her and her mentor, Bernie Sanders. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1529.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, environmental activists in New York, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1532.7s)]
*  they painted Wall Street's iconic bull [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1535.4s)]
*  to show their dedication to the climate cult and socialism. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  But then frantically, they cleaned up their mess [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1541.1000000000001s)]
*  when the cops arrived on the scene. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1543.3000000000002s)]
*  They don't actually care enough about their cause to go to jail. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1545.1000000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, if you're in Minnesota [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1549.1000000000001s)]
*  and you damage private property, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1551.7s)]
*  no consequences in Tim Wall State [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1553.6000000000001s)]
*  so long as your cause aligns [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  with the radical left Democratic extremists. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1558.2s)]
*  For example, a far left Minnesota state employee [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1560.8s)]
*  was just gifted a get out of jail free card [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1564.2s)]
*  by a woke district attorney [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1567.0s)]
*  after allegedly causing more than $20,000 in damage [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1568.6000000000001s)]
*  to several Tesla vehicles. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1573.2s)]
*  Sounds like domestic terrorism to me, but what would I know? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1575.5s)]
*  Make no mistake, at the end of the day, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1578.5s)]
*  this has nothing to do with the earth cooling, global warming, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1580.5s)]
*  which has evolved into the generic climate change. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1583.8s)]
*  So if it gets warm, they have a name for it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1586.3s)]
*  If it gets cold, they have a name for it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1589.5s)]
*  If it snows, they've got a name for it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1591.2s)]
*  If it doesn't snow, they have a name for it. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1593.1s)]
*  Look at this list. It's the Green New Deal. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1595.2s)]
*  Look, everything on this list [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1598.0s)]
*  has nothing to do really with climate. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1599.8s)]
*  Climate warming, climate cooling, climate changing [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1602.1s)]
*  is the left's mechanism for Marxism, statism, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1605.8s)]
*  as represented by that list. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1610.0s)]
*  To each according to their need, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1612.5s)]
*  from each according to their ability. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1614.6s)]
*  The only thing Democrats really care about [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1616.9s)]
*  actually is political power and you being dependent on them. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1619.2s)]
*  And this is the result. Look at this heartbreaking video. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1623.2s)]
*  This is a little girl in San Francisco [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1626.3s)]
*  attempting to ride her scooter down a sidewalk [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1628.3s)]
*  that's lined with strung out drug addicts. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1631.0s)]
*  Great job, Gavin. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1633.2s)]
*  Now Democrats want to control every aspect of your life [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1634.7s)]
*  on top of what they already control. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1637.5s)]
*  You know, they've done so well giving you [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1639.7s)]
*  nearly $40 trillion in debt. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1642.0s)]
*  The worst schools, in spite of spending more money [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1644.4s)]
*  in the entire industrialized world, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1647.2s)]
*  they brought Social Security and Medicaid [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1649.7s)]
*  to the brink of bankruptcy. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1651.9s)]
*  And by the way, how's law and order [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1654.4s)]
*  and safety and security working out in your town, in your city, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1656.4s)]
*  since the defund, dismantle, no bail laws [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1661.2s)]
*  were implemented by the left? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1664.2s)]
*  Now even leftist Governor Newsom, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1666.1000000000001s)]
*  he's now trying, good luck, Gavin, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1668.6s)]
*  to distance himself from the very decisions [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1670.8s)]
*  that created this horrible scene. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1674.1s)]
*  But just this week, his parole board, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1677.0s)]
*  they ordered the release of a man [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1679.1s)]
*  who was convicted of beating a toddler to death, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1680.6s)]
*  a two-year-old toddler to death [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1683.8s)]
*  after spending just 15 years in prison. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1685.7s)]
*  And by the way, Newsom should know that his party's base, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1688.5s)]
*  they don't take too kindly to self-reflection. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1691.7s)]
*  Just look at what happened to Rom-Rombo-Deadfish-Emanuel [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1694.6s)]
*  when he dared to lightly criticize [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1698.1s)]
*  the Democratic Party's radical agenda. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1699.8999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1701.8999999999999s)]
*  We were really south on kitchen table issues. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  We weren't really good about the family room issues. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1706.5s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1708.8999999999999s)]
*  I disagree with you 100 million percent. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1710.1999999999998s)]
*  The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1712.5s)]
*  and that's the smallest room in the house. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1715.1999999999998s)]
*  That is such a ****. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1716.5s)]
*  That is total ****. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  That is buying into the right-wing media narrative, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1719.1s)]
*  and I'm so sick of Democrats like you [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1721.8s)]
*  selling out and saying this. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1724.5s)]
*  Wow, Rom has not left us enough. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1726.9s)]
*  He's pretty left. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1729.1000000000001s)]
*  Democrats are in big trouble. Why? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1730.3000000000002s)]
*  Because their radical ideology, it has failed miserably. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1732.1000000000001s)]
*  Even some in Hollywood can see the handwriting's on the wall. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1736.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1739.7s)]
*  This is where I would push back. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1740.9s)]
*  When I see this kind of insight and passion [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1742.7s)]
*  being directed at the current administration [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1747.5s)]
*  and the lack of this kind of insight and passion [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1750.1000000000001s)]
*  being directed at the previous administration, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1752.5s)]
*  where again, I'm not talking about you. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1754.9s)]
*  I'm talking about left-leaning news media organizations [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1757.1000000000001s)]
*  who are kind of like, la, la, la, la, la, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1760.9s)]
*  everything's fine. Look, the environment's... [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1762.9s)]
*  I mean, look, the economy's great. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1764.7s)]
*  La, la, la, immigration's not that much of a problem. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1766.7s)]
*  And really, being Cleopatra, Queen of denial. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1768.9s)]
*  Thank you. Boom. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1772.9s)]
*  So you know the Democrats have gone too far [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1774.5s)]
*  when they get a wake-up call from San Francisco? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1776.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yesterday, local Dems there called on the National Party [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1779.5s)]
*  to move towards the center, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1784.1s)]
*  claiming there's a reckoning to be had in the party. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1786.3s)]
*  And they aim to save it by rejecting what they deride [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1789.1s)]
*  as performative politics and virtue signaling [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1791.5s)]
*  and embracing quality of life issues. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1794.3s)]
*  Now, I know what you're thinking. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1797.1s)]
*  San Francisco? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1798.6999999999998s)]
*  The hotbed of progressivism long mired by [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1800.6999999999998s)]
*  rampant homelessness, drug use, crime, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1803.5s)]
*  and Jefferson Starship? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1805.6999999999998s)]
*  The same deep blue city that became the breeding ground [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1807.6999999999998s)]
*  for such brilliant political minds [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1811.7s)]
*  like Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1813.5s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, and the Unabomber? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1815.9s)]
*  We're talking about the same San Francisco, right? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1820.3s)]
*  Well, let this be a warning for Dems. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1823.7s)]
*  If SF is telling you that you have a problem, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1825.7s)]
*  you better listen. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1828.7s)]
*  It's like if Kamala told you, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1830.5s)]
*  hey, maybe you don't need another shot of Jameson. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1831.9s)]
*  Or Jay Pritzker saying, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1837.3s)]
*  Hey, go easy on the nacho cheese. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1838.5s)]
*  Or Trey Gowdy telling you, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1841.7s)]
*  yeah, you need a new barber. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1843.7s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1848.3s)]
*  He is a cartoon. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1850.7s)]
*  Now, if the left truly wants to move to the center, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1853.3s)]
*  they don't need a lecturer from a city [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1855.5s)]

*  It's an issue that feeds the false dead-end [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1867.1s)]
*  sense of oppression. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1869.8999999999999s)]
*  Dems cater to victimhood [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1871.5s)]
*  and talk around the edges on every issue. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1872.8999999999999s)]
*  While Donald Trump gets to the heart of them, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1875.3s)]

*  The border's wide open. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1878.6999999999998s)]
*  Inflation's at a record high. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1880.1s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell has a mild gravitational pull. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1881.6999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, the left remained a hollowed-out party, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1886.1s)]
*  nurturing the identity politics cult [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1888.3s)]
*  until it ate them from within. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1890.1s)]
*  Then, Dems now need to stop supporting the bad guys. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1892.8999999999999s)]
*  Not everyone is a lionized victim [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1896.1s)]
*  that will magically move the masses in opposition to Trump. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1898.3s)]
*  People relate to Robin Hood [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1901.8999999999999s)]
*  because he fought corrupt politicians and high taxes, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1903.5s)]
*  not because he looted Nike. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1906.3s)]
*  Take the Maryland dad, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1910.5s)]

*  who the left elevated to folk hero status, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1941.7s)]
*  or Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-West hobgoblin, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1944.1000000000001s)]

*  Not to mention Michael Brown, Smollett, George Floyd. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1949.9s)]
*  If Jeffrey Dahmer were alive today, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1953.7s)]
*  the left would call him an environmentalist [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1955.7s)]
*  for reducing the carbon footprint. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1957.7s)]
*  Lastly, if the Dems truly want to fix things, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1960.7s)]
*  they got to drop the act, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1963.3s)]
*  because Dems are desperately attempting a rebrand, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1964.9s)]
*  and like Jesse's hair, it's fake. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1967.5s)]
*  They're calling it dark woke. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1970.9s)]
*  It's an attitude the New York Times calls provocative and edgy, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1973.1000000000001s)]
*  and it's why you have most Dems cursing [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1976.7s)]
*  like they just discovered the Too Live crew. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1978.5s)]
*  They see this as a way to win back voters [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1980.9s)]
*  and connect with Trump's bluntness. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1982.9s)]
*  But if you have to act edgy, you're not. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1984.9s)]
*  Being provocative works for Trump, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1987.9s)]
*  because that's who he is. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1989.9s)]
*  Well, that and you created a world so PC, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1991.5s)]
*  we desperately needed him. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1994.1000000000001s)]
*  So you can't be woke and provocative. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1996.1000000000001s)]
*  That's like being a marathon runner and interesting. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=1998.3000000000002s)]
*  But this dark woke BS reveals once again [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2001.9s)]
*  the Dems are as lost as Biden [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2007.5s)]
*  coming back from a bowling alley's men's room. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2009.1000000000001s)]
*  They still want trans kids. They still want open borders. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2012.5s)]
*  They still want to burn down police stations. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2015.3s)]
*  Just now, they've added swearing, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2017.5s)]
*  because they're out of ideas. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2020.3s)]
*  And why? Well, look under the hood. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2021.9s)]
*  What's the engine for their idea creation? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2023.9s)]
*  It's identity politics, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2026.5s)]
*  which both prevents you from thinking beyond [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2027.9s)]
*  your already doomed but shared assumptions, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2030.5s)]
*  but acts as a barrier against thinking of new ideas [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2033.7s)]
*  and escaping that prison. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2037.1s)]
*  This is why a new idea can't get out of bed. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2039.1s)]
*  It's strapped to the gurney with a cast of the view [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2042.1s)]
*  sitting on its chest. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2044.8999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like a drug addiction, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2046.3s)]
*  one that demands all of you. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2049.2999999999997s)]
*  So what if you lost your job and your wife? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2051.2999999999997s)]
*  All you need is me. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2053.2999999999997s)]
*  And if you ever leave me, you will die. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2054.5s)]
*  That's identity politics. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2056.5s)]
*  It shrinks your world to a small confined space, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2058.1s)]
*  convincing you that the beautiful world outside is the threat. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2060.7s)]
*  So for the Dems, this isn't a difficult challenge. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2064.5s)]
*  It's a shift in thinking. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2066.9s)]
*  Now, where you look at every failed idea you had [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2068.7s)]
*  and see what they have in common. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2071.9s)]
*  You know, for a drunk, it's always that first drink. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2073.9s)]
*  For a Democrat, it's fear, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2076.3s)]
*  a fear that their entire mindset is wrong. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2077.9s)]
*  It's hard to let go of that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2080.5s)]
*  But just try it for one day and see what happens. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2082.3s)]
*  Let's welcome... [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2085.9s)]
*  Here he is! [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2087.3s)]
*  His crowd work is asking audience, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2089.7000000000003s)]
*  why are you leaving? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2092.9s)]
*  Writer and comedian Joe DeVito. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2094.3s)]
*  He likes to perform prostate exams after hours. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2098.3s)]
*  Chief patient officer at the wellness company, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2101.9s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pizzeria. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2103.9s)]
*  She's got a black belt and makes audiences melt. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2107.3s)]
*  Financial analyst, Heather Zomalaga. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2110.1000000000004s)]
*  And in high school, he was most voted, most, most... [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2114.3s)]
*  Shut your mouth! [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2117.7000000000003s)]
*  In high school, he was most voted, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2122.1000000000004s)]
*  most likely to knock up your aunt. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2124.1000000000004s)]
*  New York has missed out on the community. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2128.3s)]
*  Give it up for the New York City Cubs! [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2131.3s)]
*  Is that you, Joe? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2134.3s)]
*  That's you, Joe. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2136.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's you. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2138.3s)]
*  I added that bad part. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2140.3s)]
*  So, Joe, what do you make of the dark woke? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2142.3s)]
*  More like dork woke. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2145.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2147.3s)]
*  They already tried this with the dark Brandon. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2149.3s)]
*  And they had Joe Biden with mood lighting, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2152.3s)]
*  which didn't work because you can't have a light near him [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2155.3s)]
*  because he'll walk toward it. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2157.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2159.3s)]
*  I... [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2161.3s)]
*  I do laugh at the idea that San Francisco moderates... [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2163.3s)]
*  What is the San Francisco moderate? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2166.3s)]
*  Is that a drag queen who puts the toilet seat back down [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2168.3s)]
*  when the other lady is moving? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2170.3s)]
*  I think the problem is the Democrats, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2172.3s)]
*  they keep picking the worst people to be their heroes. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2174.3s)]
*  I mean, they literally picked a gang member [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2178.3s)]
*  whose first name starts with the word kill. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2180.3s)]
*  Yes! [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2183.3s)]
*  So, yeah, it's just... It's crazy. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2185.3s)]
*  And he's a bad... He's like... [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2187.3s)]
*  He's not even MS-13. He's like MS-18. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2189.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2191.3s)]
*  So that's who they picked. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2193.3s)]
*  And now, you know, you see them all heading down to El Salvador. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2195.3s)]
*  But why him? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2198.3s)]
*  Because we still have American citizens [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2200.3s)]
*  who were held hostage in Gaza. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2202.3s)]
*  I don't see them booking that flight. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2204.3s)]
*  So that shows you... [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2206.3s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2208.3s)]
*  And it's not... [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2210.3s)]
*  It's not... It's not... [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2212.3s)]
*  They keep saying we need to rebrand. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2214.3s)]
*  It's not rebranding. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2216.3s)]
*  It's... If you keep... You need to keep rebranding. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2218.3s)]
*  Your product sucks, okay? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2220.3s)]
*  You can't keep saying, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2222.3s)]
*  flaming bag of... now in designer colors. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2224.3s)]
*  It's like, no, it's a deeper problem. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2226.3s)]
*  It's a good point about MS-13. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2228.3s)]
*  I'm gonna wait till they're MS-21 before I ask them out. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2230.3s)]
*  Go ahead, Drew. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2233.3s)]
*  I want to talk about Darko, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2235.3s)]
*  because I want to do a public service here. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2237.3s)]
*  I want to inoculate the public and the audience [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2239.3s)]
*  without a syringe. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2241.3s)]
*  I'm gonna inoculate you against propaganda. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2243.3s)]
*  There are two words that are propagandistic. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2245.3s)]
*  Every time you hear them, assume propaganda. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2247.3s)]
*  Chaos. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2249.3s)]
*  Brent Scott Adam points that out. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2251.3s)]
*  And dark. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2253.3s)]
*  Those are thoughtful propaganda. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2255.3s)]
*  Do not fall for it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2257.3s)]
*  And whenever you hear people saying, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2259.3s)]
*  you are an oligarch, for instance, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2261.3s)]
*  it's coming from an oligarchy. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2263.3s)]
*  What you should hear instead of you are, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2265.3s)]
*  is I am. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2267.3s)]
*  They're always the way narcissists work. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2269.3s)]
*  The system has always been like that. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2271.3s)]
*  They are accusing and projecting of exactly [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2273.3s)]
*  what they're doing every time. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2275.3s)]
*  It's been all through the last eight years. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2277.3s)]
*  And here we are again. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2279.3s)]
*  And last thing about San Francisco, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2281.3s)]
*  yes, you're right, if they're calling you, you are in big trouble. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2283.3s)]
*  But what they're saying is, you need to consider becoming a Republican. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2285.3s)]
*  Think of what the headline was. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2287.3s)]
*  And they say that kind of stuff in California. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2289.3s)]
*  And they go, no, no, no, we didn't really mean it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2291.3s)]
*  And they don't do anything. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2293.3s)]
*  How soon will they have to put out a retraction? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2295.3s)]
*  How are you? You seem like you're dozing over there. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2297.3s)]
*  Dr. Drew saw me in the lobby at the hotel. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2301.3s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, please, I hope he didn't see. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2303.3s)]
*  I have no hair, no makeup, no hair. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2305.3s)]
*  So he can't get over it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2307.3s)]
*  And I was like, maybe he didn't see me. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2309.3s)]
*  And he goes, hey, I know you. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2311.3s)]
*  We're doing a show together tonight. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2313.3s)]
*  I was like, oh no, my God. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2315.3s)]
*  And she said, well, I have my juice. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2317.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2319.3s)]
*  And you said, just leave it on the counter. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2321.3s)]
*  And we'll call you in three days. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2323.3s)]
*  And let you know if you got anything. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2325.3s)]
*  I always hated that. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2327.3s)]
*  When you had to walk out with the little container [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2329.3s)]
*  and it's warm and you feel like you got to put it on the counter. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2331.3s)]
*  Heather, this is what happens when you take me off course. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2333.3s)]
*  The thing about this dark woke stuff is [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2337.3s)]
*  it's not organic. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2339.3s)]
*  It is like the opposite of organic I'm finding is propaganda. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2341.3s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2343.3s)]
*  Right. Well, I do like, they're calling it [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2345.3s)]
*  new pragmatism. Is that the name? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2347.3s)]
*  I do like that they're trying to move [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2349.3s)]
*  more to the middle or the center. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2351.3s)]
*  They've realized, to Joe's point, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2353.3s)]
*  that the brand and the messaging [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2355.3s)]
*  is not working. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2357.3s)]
*  And so I don't know if you mentioned this. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2359.3s)]
*  I should listen better. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2361.3s)]
*  The YouGov poll says AOC [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2363.3s)]
*  has 61% approval ratings [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2365.3s)]
*  for Democrats, right? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2367.3s)]
*  The highest of any Democrat unless [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2369.3s)]
*  they've been elected president. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2371.3s)]
*  So if your new brand ambassador [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2373.3s)]
*  is going to be AOC, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2375.3s)]
*  then I think it's more than just [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2377.3s)]
*  the messaging and the branding. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2379.3s)]
*  You also need a new brand ambassador. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2381.3s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2383.3s)]
*  All right, Tyrus. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2385.3s)]
*  You mentioned this a long time ago. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2387.3s)]
*  It always stuck with me that they are always dancing [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2389.3s)]
*  around the edges. They don't do the heavy lifting. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2391.3s)]
*  No. And I think the San Francisco [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2393.3s)]
*  is saying it's time to do the heavy lifting. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2395.3s)]
*  Well, let's not, let's stop [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2397.3s)]
*  giving them so much credit, Greg. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2399.3s)]
*  Just because one person [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2401.3s)]
*  decided to say, I'm going to write this [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2403.3s)]
*  doesn't mean the entire party's changed. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2405.3s)]
*  And that's the problem. They're a party of activists. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2407.3s)]
*  So until they get the activists out, there's always going to be [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2409.3s)]
*  this, this ridiculousness, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2411.3s)]
*  this dark woke. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2413.3s)]
*  You know, as a [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2415.3s)]
*  dark person, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2417.3s)]
*  keep that s*** to yourself. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2419.3s)]
*  Why don't you go with [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2421.3s)]
*  white woke or take one of the many [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2423.3s)]
*  colors you stole from the rainbow and make [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2425.3s)]
*  it a purple woke. You know, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2427.3s)]
*  orange woke. Why you got to put that s*** on off? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2429.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2431.3s)]
*  You know? Yeah, you know what it is. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2433.3s)]
*  It's racist. It is. Because they're assuming [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2435.3s)]
*  that something dark is [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2437.3s)]
*  kind of dangerous. Yeah, dangerous. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2439.3s)]
*  Like they're, they're Darth woke, you know? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2441.3s)]
*  But the thing is, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2443.3s)]
*  is the reason why they can't get it, they can't change [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2445.3s)]
*  and they won't change is because they have no respect [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2447.3s)]
*  for the American people. You guys keep asking [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2449.3s)]
*  why do they pick the George Floyds? Why do they pick [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2451.3s)]
*  MSN 13 [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2453.3s)]
*  Home Dad? Because that's what they think of the [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2455.3s)]
*  American people. They think, hey, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2457.3s)]
*  this is what the average American is like [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2459.3s)]
*  as far as we can tell. So when we [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2461.3s)]
*  take one of their champions, which is always [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2463.3s)]
*  a thug, a person with horrible character, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2465.3s)]
*  they're going to rally around us [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2467.3s)]
*  because we're trying to help them because they don't read [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2469.3s)]
*  good and they all want to play in the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2471.3s)]
*  NBA. And they, you know, but that's [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2473.3s)]
*  why you pick people like that [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2475.3s)]
*  because that's who you think represents [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2477.3s)]
*  the dummies who vote for you. So as [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2479.3s)]
*  long as that's where they're at, but again, whose [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2481.3s)]
*  fault is that? You dumb [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2483.3s)]
*  s*** vote for these idiots. Like that's [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2485.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2487.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2489.3s)]
*  They also, they would [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2491.3s)]
*  appreciate that the Republican Party was [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2493.3s)]
*  completely dismantled. The old [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2495.3s)]
*  oligarchy with like Romney, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2497.3s)]
*  Bush and Cheney. It's a different [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2499.3s)]
*  organization and they're not willing to do that with [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2501.3s)]
*  the Democratic Party. You know what? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2503.3s)]
*  Republicans went through their catharsis [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2505.3s)]
*  and now it's the Democrats [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2507.3s)]
*  and they'll get, they'll probably get through it, but [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2509.3s)]
*  I'll just have to wait and see. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2511.3s)]
*  That's what our host says. We'll just [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2513.3s)]
*  wait, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2515.3s)]
*  Very CNN. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2517.3s)]
*  Awoke DA saves a [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2519.3s)]
*  lot of people. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC4LE0CympM&t=2521.3s)]
