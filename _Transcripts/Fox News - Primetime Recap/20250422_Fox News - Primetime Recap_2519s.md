# Fox News Highlights - April 21st, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle. Thank you, as always, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=0.0s)]
*  for spending time with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=5.32s)]
*  The crisis that they created. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=7.32s)]
*  Another day, another predictable stretch of Democrat fear mongering. Now, in the absence [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  of a positive agenda of their own, they're trying to scare Americans and legal immigrants [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=19.36s)]
*  into thinking that if they get, I don't know, stopped for speeding or maybe have too many [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  unpaid parking tickets, you could risk end up being ending up in a Salvadoran supermax [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=29.56s)]
*  prison. It is a government funded kidnapping. Plain and simple. Gilmar, a father of three, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=35.36s)]
*  lived in Maryland for over half his adult life. He had legal permission to stay in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=43.32s)]
*  United States. No one is safe in Trump's America. No one is safe. And the Academy Award goes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  to Congresswoman Dexter. Now, first off, Albrego Garcia was an illegal alien who two courts [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=56.4s)]
*  had determined was a gangbanger. His case had been reviewed by two judges who rejected [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=64.44s)]
*  his arguments. Now, he and everyone else who was here illegally should have never been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  allowed in and should have been deported years ago. And as for the line that no one is safe [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=74.88s)]
*  in Trump's America, well, that's partially true, but not the way the Congresswoman intends [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=80.44s)]
*  it. If people are unsafe, it's not because of President Trump. It's because of the open [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=85.92s)]
*  border nightmare that the DC Uniparty inflicted on our beautiful country. Now, we shouldn't [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=92.32s)]
*  even have to be talking about how we're going to deport Biden's 11 million illegals. We [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=98.68s)]
*  shouldn't have to be talking about how ICE can track down the thousands of illegal felons [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=105.36s)]
*  here and then remove them from our communities, or how to find the 300,000 missing children [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=109.72000000000001s)]
*  who cross the border, or how to get nonviolent illegals to self-deport using that app. And [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=116.48s)]
*  we shouldn't have to explain to parents why their kids' schools are overcrowded. We shouldn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=123.64000000000001s)]
*  have to tell small business owners that, look, you might have to face organized theft rings [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=129.56s)]
*  of illegals. Look at the smiles on those TDA members. Our city shouldn't be reeling [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=135.4s)]
*  with serious illegal alien criminals hiding in plain sight. Just a few days ago, we learned [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  that of the 206 illegals arrested between April 6 and April 12 in New York, ICE says [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  more than half had significant criminal convictions or are currently facing charges for crimes [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=154.04s)]
*  like murder, assault, arson, rape, drugs, and illegal firearms. That's all. One is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=160.28s)]
*  a foreign fugitive wanted for crimes in his home country, and one has a homicide conviction [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=166.48s)]
*  in the Philippines. This is the nightmarish world that not just Biden, but the entire [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=172.24s)]
*  globalist old guard created. One where during Biden's term in office, GOP members of Congress [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=179.44s)]
*  would express impassioned outrage over the border crush, but they wouldn't do anything [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=186.6s)]
*  else. Spending bills kept getting greenlit. All the while, the migrant numbers kept skyrocketing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=191.6s)]
*  And of course, zero empathy from Democrats for the Americans who never voted for this, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  but were forced to deal with this crisis. You're so strong about protecting those aliens, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=205.36s)]
*  but you won't do nothing for the U.S. citizens. We are the ones who pay your salaries. They [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=211.84s)]
*  start with cutting off illegals, getting free everything. That'll save us a lot of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  money, what, 600 million? And now, for purely political reasons, Democrats are catawalling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  about the plight of Mr. Albrego Garcia. We need a new word for phony when it comes to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=232.4s)]
*  the MS-13 defenders. I would say they were illegally abducted by U.S. government agents [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=239.4s)]
*  and then taken to foreign prisons against the law. And the reason why it's important [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  to treat each of these cases individually under the law is because our constitution [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  requires due process before people can be deprived of their liberty. Yeah, that's nice. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=259.16s)]
*  Nice, Chris. But what process would really suffice for Senator Van Hollen? The answer [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=266.8s)]
*  is no process is enough for them. Because if it were up to Chris Van Hollen, all the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=273.16s)]
*  illegals would not only have a right to stay here, but then have a right to vote, run for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=281.16s)]
*  office and collect every benefit under the sun. The sad truth is Van Hollen and the quartet [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  of other Democrat copycats who mimicked his El Salvador trip today cared not one whit [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  about constitutional norms or the rule of law, for if they did, they would not have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=300.28s)]
*  sat by and allowed our country to be flooded with illegals in the first place. Congressman [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=305.84s)]
*  Jason Smith recently traveled to El Salvador and had the chance to speak with a few of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=311.74s)]
*  the deported MS-13 illegals whose deportation left-wing legal groups object to. While we [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=316.44s)]
*  were there, there was two different MS-13 gang members that we spoke to within their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=322.84s)]
*  cells. One was originally deported from Highland Park, California, who told us that he had [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=329.28s)]
*  killed six people while in the United States. And then there was another one deported from [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=336.28s)]
*  Northern Virginia. These are terrorists according to Donald Trump's designation, and they're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=341.64s)]
*  in the right place right now in El Salvador. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=347.52s)]
*  How this plays out legally, it's anyone's guess. While politically Trump's on solid [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=350.32s)]
*  ground, things may get stickier, as we've already seen, in court because the DOJ's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=356.32s)]
*  own lawyer originally conceded that Abrego Garcia had been sent into this supermax prison [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=362.04s)]
*  erroneously. Well, of course, that triggered the judges who already loathed Trump and some [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=369.2s)]
*  constitutionalists on the conservative side as well. And over the weekend, another setback [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=374.44s)]
*  for Trump at the Supreme Court, when a 7-2 majority ruled in the wee hours of the morning [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=379.44s)]
*  that further deportations of Tren Oroagua gang members should be temporarily halted. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=385.12s)]
*  Justices Thomas and Alito, as usual, were correct in dissent, with Alito writing, in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=392.0s)]
*  the middle of the night, the court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=397.36s)]
*  without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=402.6s)]
*  Even eight hours are receiving the application with dubious factual support for its order. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=408.56s)]
*  Both the executive and the judiciary have an obligation to follow the law. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=414.44s)]
*  And late today, President Trump, on Truth Social, expressed his frustration, noting [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=420.32s)]
*  that, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=425.0s)]
*  I'm doing what I was elected to do, remove criminals from our country, but the courts [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=426.0s)]
*  don't seem to want me to do that. We cannot give everyone a trial because to do so would [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=429.8s)]
*  take, without exaggeration, 200 years. We'd need hundreds of thousands of trials for the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=435.06s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of illegals we're sending out of the country. Such a thing is not possible [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=440.74s)]
*  to do. What a ridiculous situation we're in. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=445.22s)]
*  Oh, he's right about that. The crisis that they created, not Trump. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=447.82s)]
*  The bottom line, Democrats are open borders radicals. But now they think they've turned [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=454.5s)]
*  the table on Trump on the question of lawlessness. And they're itching for Trump and his team [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=461.82s)]
*  to be found in contempt because it would then help their narrative that he thinks he's above [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=468.54s)]
*  the law. And if Democrats win the House in 2026, they will cite this case as grounds [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=473.38s)]
*  for his impeachment. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=480.58s)]
*  But Pam Bondi, the attorney general, John Sauer, the solicitor general, they're both [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=482.98s)]
*  very talented lawyers. So this one migrants case poorly handled by a lower level staffer, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=486.22s)]
*  I think they know it shouldn't end up being a defining moment for Trump's immigration [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=493.62s)]
*  priorities. They, the Democrats, created this crisis. And that's the angle. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=498.58000000000004s)]
*  Lamb chops, egg hunts and church. My Easter was about the same, but at the White House, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=505.3s)]
*  it was a little different. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=509.62s)]
*  You remember the bunny with Joe Biden? Remember? You remember when the when the bunny took [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=512.7s)]
*  Joe Biden out? He's not going to take he's not taking Trump out. Anyway, that was a good [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=518.7s)]
*  that was a beautiful moment when the bunny saved Joe Biden. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=525.94s)]
*  The Easter bunny wasn't body checking the president away from the press. Kids weren't [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=529.74s)]
*  being sniffed. And there were real eggs. 30,000 of them were scattered on the South Lawn. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=533.38s)]
*  Egg prices are down. It's what Jesus would have wanted. And President Trump was moved [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=539.26s)]
*  by the Holy Spirit to say this on Sunday, quote, happy Easter to all, including the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=544.5s)]
*  radical left lunatics who were fighting and scheming so hard to bring murderers, drug [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=549.46s)]
*  lords, dangerous prisoners, and the mentally insane and well known ms 13 gang members [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=554.14s)]
*  and wife beaters back into the country. Democrats spent all weekend hunting for the wrong eggs. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=559.54s)]
*  They're looking for one bad huevo in El Salvador and more Democrats hopped on the caravan caucus [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=566.86s)]
*  and headed south. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  After a long day, we have arrived in El Salvador. I am here with several of my colleagues to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=575.58s)]
*  demand that Donald Trump release Kilmar, a brego Garcia, union member, Maryland man who [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=580.74s)]
*  was wrongfully detained and deported. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=587.5s)]
*  We are here to release Kilmar, a brego Garcia. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=591.14s)]
*  We're also here to make a statement that this cannot be allowed and isn't allowed in our [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=594.98s)]
*  country. This is a massive due process crisis in our country. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=600.38s)]
*  So instead of spending Easter Sunday with their families, Democrats want on an egg hunt [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=604.7s)]
*  in El Salvador to undeport an illegal alien gang member accused of beating his wife. They [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=608.7s)]
*  could have spent Easter Sunday anywhere, but they wanted to spend it with ms 13. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=615.02s)]
*  You are there for an El Salvadorian man who was a resident illegally of Maryland. You're [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=620.58s)]
*  a congressman from Florida. Why are you in El Salvador? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=625.7s)]
*  Well we're here because a man who had protected status in Maryland, a Maryland man, union [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=631.1s)]
*  member, worker with a citizen wife and beautiful children was taken out of his state and out [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=636.5400000000001s)]
*  of the United States and back over here without due process. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=643.1s)]
*  Last year, run of the mill union member who traffics humans from Texas to Maryland for [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=646.9s)]
*  a construction job, allegedly. Kilmar Garcia is like Zelinsky. Politicians are flying in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=651.14s)]
*  from all over the world to get a photo op. Garcia's defense attorneys bought him a non-threatening [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  short sleeve button down that screams Maryland dad at a summer barbecue. Sources say Van [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=663.62s)]
*  Holland insisted on soup. He didn't want Garcia holding a knife or fork. Van Holland also [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  insisted he didn't order the margaritas. He got duped by El Presidente of El Salvador. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=674.98s)]
*  Democrats love the attention Van Holland got and they were convinced Kilmar was safe enough [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=681.78s)]
*  to have Easter dinner with. Problem was Garcia had plans. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=686.4599999999999s)]
*  Is there any chance you'll be meeting with Abrego Garcia while you're there? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=691.66s)]
*  We got word at the embassy that our request has been denied by the government here locally. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=695.42s)]
*  They say it's because we're not here on an official capacity, but we're not giving up. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=701.62s)]
*  We're going to continue. We're building off of the trip of Senator Van Holland and we're, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=706.26s)]
*  you know, we're not the first members here and we're not going to be the last. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=711.58s)]
*  Democrats are like you guys broke into our country. We should be able to break into yours, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=715.22s)]
*  but they didn't have the right paperwork. It's funny how that works in other countries. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=719.78s)]
*  So this isn't an official delegation. It's basically a few politicians on vacation. Van [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=725.6s)]
*  Holland made it back from his margarita date with Kilmar just in time for Easter and we got stuck with the bill. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=730.94s)]
*  Who did pay for this trip? This was an officially cleared congressional trip. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=738.34s)]
*  So taxpayer dollars. Yes, like every other trip. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=744.46s)]
*  So instead of seeing his family, Van Holland spent the weekend doing Sunday shows, bragging about his conjugal visit with MS-13. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=748.3800000000001s)]
*  Honey, it's Easter Sunday. The kids really want to spend some time with you and you've been gone all week. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=755.3000000000001s)]
*  Do you have to spend Easter on TV? Republicans are calling Van Holland the new senator from El Salvador and the esteemed senator from El Salvador is proud of it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=760.9399999999999s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, who knows a thing or two about photo ops, says enough already. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=771.22s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom of California calling Mr. Brega Garcia's case, quote, the distraction of the day. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=776.62s)]
*  He argues Democrats are playing right into the hands of President Trump, an issue he wants to be focused on. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=782.9s)]
*  How do you respond to Governor Newsom? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=788.66s)]
*  I think Americans are tired of elected officials or politicians who are all finger to the wind. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=790.26s)]
*  What's blowing this way? What's blowing that way? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=796.26s)]
*  And anybody who can't stand up for the Constitution and the right of due process doesn't deserve to lead. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=798.5s)]
*  When did Kilmar Garcia change his name to due process? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=805.26s)]
*  Was it right around the time Democrats discovered he was MS-13? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=808.9399999999999s)]
*  Last week, they were defending a Maryland man. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration abducted and imprisoned a Maryland man. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  Kilmar of Brega Garcia, the Maryland man. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  A Maryland man. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=823.14s)]
*  Maryland man. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=824.1s)]
*  The growing calls to return the Maryland man. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  That Maryland man. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=826.9s)]
*  The Maryland man. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=828.1s)]
*  The wrongful deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  He is, of course, the Maryland man now held in El Salvador. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=832.26s)]
*  What happened to the Maryland man? Well, he became MS-13 who gave his wife black eyes, allegedly. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=835.46s)]
*  That's when Democrats stopped defending MS-13. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=842.58s)]
*  Now they're defending due process for MS-13. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=845.62s)]
*  The party that brought us cancel culture, the Me Too movement, and the Trump trials, definitely cares about due process. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=850.82s)]
*  Democrats have decided they want to be defense attorneys for MS-13. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=859.46s)]
*  Americans hate MS-13. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=863.86s)]
*  How do you think we feel about their defense attorneys? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=866.26s)]
*  So what did Van Hollen talk to his client about when they were sharing marks? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=869.62s)]
*  Can you say with absolute certainty that he is not, nor has he ever been, a member of the MS-13 gang? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=874.66s)]
*  And did you ask him point blank? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=880.42s)]
*  Well, Dana, what Donald Trump is trying to do here is change the subject. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=884.9s)]
*  Since you were the one person to have met with him, and since this is a thing, you say on social media, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=889.38s)]
*  it's what we hear from Donald Trump and Republicans every day, all day long, you didn't ask him? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=895.46s)]
*  I didn't ask him that because I know what his answer is. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=902.5s)]
*  What he told me was he was sad, traumatized that he was being in prison because he has committed no crimes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=905.46s)]
*  Van Hollen spent a half hour with Kilmar and never asked, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=914.1s)]
*  uh, you know those tattoos on your knuckles? Please tell me those aren't MS-13, right? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=917.14s)]
*  How many Maryland dads do you know have a marijuana leaf, a smiley face, a cross, and a skull tatted on their fingers? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  Experts that I spoke to, people that I trust, people that are former gang prosecutors and investigators, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=930.5s)]
*  tell me that those tattoos most likely represent the letters MS and the numbers 13. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=936.74s)]
*  You take the first letter of the Spanish word representing each, and that's MS, and then you've got a cross [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=945.22s)]
*  commonly representing one, and the last one is a C in Spanish, and it's the third letter in the alphabet, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=951.22s)]
*  so that represents the number three. That is my understanding. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=957.38s)]
*  So we asked Garcia's attorney, what's going on with the tats? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=961.22s)]
*  Why has his wife been covering them all up with emojis and photos? Well, they just got back to us. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=964.5s)]
*  No idea. Now, Holman says you don't get that kind of tattoo unless you're a bad ombre. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=971.06s)]
*  Tattoos are one of many factors that's going to determine some of the gangs. It's not the only one. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=978.1s)]
*  You can't ignore a tattoo. That's one more factor that leads you to believe maybe the gang member. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=982.66s)]
*  It's just not based on tattoos. It's based on a lot of other things, but tattoo is one of many, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=988.1s)]
*  but no one's removed just because of a tattoo. MSNBC doesn't want you to know that they're [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=992.58s)]
*  defending a guy from MS-13. If you say that on their air, they'll cut you off. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=997.86s)]
*  In 2019, Garcia was issued a deportation order. Two separate judges affirmed Garcia was a member [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1003.7800000000001s)]
*  of MS-13, which is a gang that may be even worse. We've been watching President Donald Trump there, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1010.0200000000001s)]
*  swearing in the new administrator of the CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Mehmet Oz. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1015.7800000000001s)]
*  The media is hiding the truth, and Garcia's lawyer says the truth is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1023.62s)]
*  he slugs his wife, traffics humans, and is a member of a bloodthirsty gang. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1029.86s)]
*  They try and find dirty laundry in our client, which really is irrelevant. First of all, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1034.5s)]
*  their evidence is extraordinarily thin, but even if there was something there, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1040.26s)]
*  that's really irrelevant. Democrats say if you don't look at all the evidence, this violent gangster [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1044.1799999999998s)]
*  is just a Maryland dad. It's like when they said if you don't look at all the evidence that the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1051.06s)]
*  virus came from a lab, it came from a wet market. If you don't look at all the evidence that Biden's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1055.06s)]
*  senile, then Biden's in great shape. Tampon's daughter says he's not MS-13. Kilmore's more like Jesus. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1061.22s)]
*  If Jesus were alive today and in the United States, this administration would have already [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  taken him and removed him from this country without due process, claimed he was a member [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1076.98s)]
*  of the MS-13 gang as a way to try to justify not giving him due process. MS-13's being unjustly [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1084.42s)]
*  crucified like Jesus? Kilmore Garcia's dying for the sins of 20 million bad hombres? This isn't [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1092.8200000000002s)]
*  about due process. It's about overdue process. You don't skip the process of legally coming here [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1101.0600000000002s)]
*  and then demand a process when we kick you out. You can't cut in line to come here and then wait [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1107.54s)]
*  in line to leave. Doesn't work like that. The Democrats are arguing that every illegal alien [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1113.06s)]
*  gang member should get a lawyer and years of hearings and appeals. I'll be retired by the time [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1118.58s)]
*  these guys get deported. And don't worry, I don't plan on retiring soon. The only people who want [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1125.3s)]
*  a slow walk deportations are lawyers, illegals, and Van Hollans. The rest of the country wants [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1132.1s)]
*  them gone and they don't care where they go. Democrats let foreign gangs invade America [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1138.02s)]
*  and now they're whining that Trump's supporting them too fast. And the media says anyone who [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1143.06s)]
*  supports deporting illegals is a Nazi. What did Hitler do in the Holocaust? He took people from [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1147.62s)]
*  Germany to other countries where there was no German law. There was not even a pretense of [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1154.82s)]
*  German law. They took him to Poland or Hungary and they killed him. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1161.62s)]
*  And so when you see what's happening right now with this El Salvadoran gulag, I mean this [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1167.06s)]
*  CICOT gulag, he's basically taking a page out of that playbook you think? First of all Matthews [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1171.2199999999998s)]
*  look shipwrecked. And if deporting illegals makes you Hitler then Barack Obama should have a little [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1178.4199999999998s)]
*  mustache. He deported over three million illegals and Matthews got a thrill up his leg. Now the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1184.1s)]
*  media says if Trump can deport Latin American gangsters your daughter is going to get kidnapped [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1190.34s)]
*  from chemistry class. If they could do it to them, if they could snatch students off the street [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1195.94s)]
*  without any pushback or recourse, they will do it to any of us. To be very clear it's going to be [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1201.78s)]
*  the people of color and vulnerable communities that are next in line. Trump campaigned on deporting [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1207.06s)]
*  Biden migrants. He won so he's doing it. Biden never campaigned on opening the borders. He did it [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1213.06s)]
*  and lost. That's democracy. But Jamie Raskin doesn't like that and says if foreign leaders [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1219.46s)]
*  work with a president who wins in a landslide, Democrats are going to punish him. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1226.5s)]
*  If and when we come back to power, and we will, we are not going to look kindly upon people [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1232.42s)]
*  who facilitated, to use a word of the day, who facilitated authoritarianism in our country. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1239.6200000000001s)]
*  Democrats say Trump's a dictator and now they're saying just wait until they get back in power? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1247.94s)]
*  I'm confused. They can't even get their hoaxes straight. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1253.8600000000001s)]
*  Everyone in Maryland says El Salvador can keep this guy. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1258.1000000000001s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity and this Monday night we have a lot of ground to cover including a special [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1269.22s)]
*  Hannity investigation tonight into far-left elite universities. They believe they are above the law [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1273.38s)]
*  entitled to tens of millions of your hard-earned tax dollars in spite of multi-billion dollar [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1279.94s)]

*  Well I think the message that comes from the Democratic Party is a good message. The problem [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1441.94s)]
*  we've got is that we have to depend upon the media to deliver it. If we have the Washington Post for [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1446.66s)]

*  Hollen had all the time in the world for his trip to El Salvador that you paid for by the way to meet [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1522.1000000000001s)]

*  Donald Trump Van Hollen was more than willing to look past all of these glaring red flags. In fact [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1547.46s)]
*  the senator didn't even bother to ask this guy whether you know his new friend was a member of [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1553.3s)]
*  MS-13. Take a look. Can you say with absolute certainty that he is not nor has he ever been a member of the MS-13 [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1558.74s)]
*  gang and did you ask him point blank. Well Dana what Donald Trump is trying to do here is change the subject. The [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1566.1s)]
*  subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give people to give a [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1575.7s)]
*  break. Garcia his due process rights. But since you were the one person to have met with him and since this is a [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1584.26s)]
*  thing you say on social media it's what we hear from Donald Trump and Republicans every day all day long. You didn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1592.34s)]
*  ask him. I didn't ask him that because I know what his answer is. What he told me was he was sad traumatized that he was [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1598.58s)]
*  being in prison because he has committed no crimes. Oh OK entering the country illegally is not a crime [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1608.42s)]
*  anymore thanks to Chris Van Hollen. He obviously doesn't care if he's a violent gang member. He just wants him back [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1616.02s)]
*  in the U.S. Maybe he'll let him move into his house. In fact most Democrats seem to want the same thing. Even Tim Wall's [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1622.1000000000001s)]

*  Now today four more Democratic lawmakers they have now traveled themselves to El Salvador in a desperate attempt to meet [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1636.34s)]
*  with their new hero. Take a look. More importantly we're here to raise awareness that Kilmer needs to come home to build [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1642.66s)]
*  support here in El Salvador but also in the United States. He must come home. This is not just a threat to all people in the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1650.46s)]
*  United States who could be illegally abducted detained and transported internationally against their will. We have to draw [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1659.74s)]
*  the line here. We have to make a big deal about this. Members of Congress have to come here and use the privilege we have to [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1668.74s)]
*  advocate at the highest levels to make sure that Kilmer is brought home. Why didn't they raise awareness when Joe Biden and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1675.9s)]
*  Kamala Harris had wide open borders known terrorists known murderers rapists gang members cartel members 10 to 14 to million [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1683.58s)]
*  illegals entering our country. Why didn't they raise awareness and call that out at the time. They are lawmakers. Why didn't they [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1692.54s)]
*  insist that we we we have a rule of law in this country. This is insane. Remember not long ago this was the Democratic Party's [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1699.82s)]
*  stance on illegal immigration. Oh how they have changed so quickly. Take a look. I think we got to have tough conditions. Tell people [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1708.22s)]
*  to come out of the shadows if they've committed a crime deport them. No questions asked. They're gone. If they if they've been working [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1717.5s)]
*  and are law abiding we should say here are the conditions for you staying. You have to pay a stiff fine because you came here [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1727.98s)]
*  illegally. You have to pay back taxes and you have to try to learn English and you have to wait in line. Never thought I'd say it. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1733.66s)]
*  Hillary sounds a lot like Donald Trump. Now here we are in 2025. Democrats are trying to bring back an alleged gang member human [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1743.0600000000002s)]
*  trafficker who's been deported in our country illegally. It's almost hard to believe just how psychotic radicalized this Democratic Party [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1750.02s)]
*  has become. Now the DNC vice chair David Hogg is now plotting a new civil war within the Democratic ranks in order to purge less [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1757.38s)]
*  extreme candidates and Democrats from deep blue congressional districts. Now with each passing day the Democratic Party is only getting more [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1766.5s)]
*  and more radical more and more extreme ahead of WrestleMania. This past weekend Politico ran an article comparing the world of wrestling [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1774.6200000000001s)]
*  to Trump saying that he lives and dies by kayfabe where friend and foe alike never seem to know what's real and what's all for show. Now [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1781.7s)]
*  kayfabe is a term in pro wrestling. The unwritten rule that both the athletes and fans understand it's a combination of sport and [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1790.6200000000001s)]
*  storytelling. It's the suspension of reality you need when someone tells you Taylor Swift is hot. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1798.94s)]
*  Of course this isn't to say pro wrestling's fake. They train to fight and on top of that they're trained in skills most fighters never know. Yeah they [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1805.46s)]
*  could kill you but they can also thrill you. I know right now you're thinking man Greg sure knows wrestling. Well that's because I wrestled in high [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1818.06s)]
*  school. My signature move was the reverse cowgirl. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1826.46s)]
*  What. That is a wrestling move. My coach taught me. Now Politico claims Trump might just be America's greatest kayfabe. Part politician part [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1835.74s)]
*  entertainer a guy who knows how to play his audience and his fans. Well they're in on it too. They cheer and they boo. And true like any pro [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1849.34s)]
*  wrestler Trump knows how to cut a good trash talking promo even during Easter. Seriously do you remember the bunny with Joe Biden. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1856.94s)]
*  Do you remember the bunny with Joe Biden. Remember you remember when the when the bunny took Joe Biden out. He's not going to take. He's not [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1866.3s)]
*  taking Trump out. Anyway that was a good. That was a beautiful moment when the bunny saved Joe Biden. That was a beautiful moment. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1876.34s)]
*  Meanwhile the media is so clueless they scream every time Trump says he's thinking of annexing Rosie O'Donnell. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1887.6599999999999s)]
*  But Politico is wrong. Trump has substance behind the show or it wouldn't resonate at all. Now what are the media total kayfabe [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1893.78s)]
*  junkies. But it's not meant to entertain but to inflame fabricating outrages to incite action. So the more unhinged among them hatch [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1903.5800000000002s)]
*  assassination plots and toss Molotov's at Tesla's while their leaders jet to El Salvador for cozy lunch dates with white beating [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1911.74s)]
*  gangsters. What Trump's kayfabe game has really done is expose them showing us who his opponents really are. He's playing them like a [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1918.94s)]
*  Chinese spy telling Eric Swalwell he's hot. But we always knew they were fakes. They act like Trump is Hitler then beg for interviews [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1927.9s)]
*  when he wins. Remember when morning Joe said Trump was a danger to democracy that he and Mika bent the knee in Mar-a-Lago. I call it [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1937.6200000000001s)]
*  ballsy if Scarborough hadn't had his snipped years ago. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1945.82s)]
*  Obama called Trump a national threat then looked downright chummy with him at Carter's funeral and Kamala. She called Biden a racist to his [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1951.1s)]
*  face then laughed it off later with. Come on it's a debate. The woman was about as authentic as a Cory Booker girlfriend. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1958.54s)]
*  He likes to play the field. Come on. You want more kayfabe. There was the contrived fantasy that Biden was sentient or that Kamala [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1966.02s)]
*  was competent. And who could forget the astronauts from last week pretending their 11 minute ride was an achievement for women when they [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1978.3s)]
*  were simply pimping space travel for rich people. Of course there's trans men cause playing as women who demanded us to play along. But [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1985.82s)]
*  unlike a great wrestler dudes pretending to be chicks can't convince us their identity is real especially when you catch them texting at the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=1994.5s)]
*  urinal. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2001.26s)]
*  But in politics kayfabe has casualties in Minnesota. One of Tim Walz's state employees was arrested for vandalizing Tesla's. These fools [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2004.22s)]
*  they're like six year olds watching Spongebob Squarepants and thinking it's real. Don't they know those cars have more hidden cameras [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2013.06s)]
*  than my guest bedroom. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2019.98s)]
*  Yet when they're arrested they act like a dog who has just shown a card trick. What happened. But it's not theater anymore. Dems and media [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2024.6200000000001s)]
*  primed the mob by pretending Trump is Hitler. Then run and hide when their grunts follow through. Suddenly kayfabe becomes domestic [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2032.5s)]
*  terrorism. So this isn't on Trump. It's on the people who demonized him while knowing it was all theater. And now the political kayfabe is [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2040.7s)]

*  doesn't quite work with Trump. It's so interesting because. Well did everyone know this kayfabe. I never heard of this still today. I don't know [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2138.38s)]
*  if it was something that most people are aware of but I think it's interesting. In the article they make the case for it because they talk [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2144.62s)]
*  about how it came about. The amazing thing is that these wrestlers they create their own narratives and that is what Trump does. And so this [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2151.06s)]
*  idea is if Trump knows it now in Trump 2.0 he's even more kayfabe than he was before because look what's happening this week. Who are the villains [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2162.34s)]
*  international you know gang terrorists. Yeah right. And we're discussing we're now having the discussion. What was it last time when he was trying to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2169.1000000000004s)]
*  deport people it was over the families at the border family separation and the media was able to create the narrative. Trump is out in front of [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2177.26s)]
*  this. And now what are we discussing. Did the guy beat his wife or didn't he. You know it's all it's down to basically like how guilty is this [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2183.74s)]
*  guy. Yeah. And even Democrats are now they're trying to defend him. So Trump he has people you know Democrats now they're defending a [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2191.06s)]
*  terrorist right. A gang criminal they're defending. What else this week. Harvard. Yes. Harvard's like the only thing less popular than a [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2199.7s)]
*  terrorist. You know like the Harvard clubs on 44th Street go there. They don't even like Harvard there. Yeah that's true. So it's the narrative has [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2207.78s)]
*  totally switched and now Democrats don't know what they do. They're all they're defending villains at this point. Yeah you know Glenn you've been in [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2219.2200000000003s)]
*  wrestling and politics. Do you find this to be a fair comparison. You are like the expert. So if you are unfamiliar with the term kayfabe I'll give you an [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2225.86s)]
*  example. Think Joe Biden shaking hands with thin air or being escorted around by the Easter bunny. And then the media is saying oh he's sharp as [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2236.3s)]
*  attack. Never been better. That's exactly what we're talking about. Donald Trump is a larger than life personality that served him well ever since he [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2247.34s)]
*  was real estate mogul then on TV then as president United States. It's a persona that he's gained an advantage. But the reason that it works is [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2255.86s)]
*  because it's who he is. Yeah. If you want to look at the fakers it ain't Donald Trump. It's the people on the other side of the aisle. And that's why they're [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2264.14s)]
*  just not successful because they're trying to be something that they're not. Yeah it's authenticity. Very. Catherine. Pam. Yes. How are you. I'm good. Very [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2271.8199999999997s)]
*  stripey today. Thank you. What do you make of this analogy this wrestling analogy. I think it's pretty decent. I love the idea of somebody in the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2282.8199999999997s)]
*  Politico newsroom being like I've heard of a thing called wrestling. Yes. And the whole newsroom is like who let a state school kid. I got it. We get [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2290.82s)]
*  one of these. But I don't. They're uncovering something that I think many commentators have noticed for like a decade which is that this man is the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2300.42s)]
*  ultimate showman and that that's part of how he creates narratives. That's part of how he convinces people. And the authenticity is actually part of it is [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2307.7000000000003s)]
*  that his id is showman and that is what works for him. All right. I leave it to you. Well first of all I'd like to point out one thing. Yes. That we all need to [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2315.9s)]
*  pay a little respect to everyone. There's been a lot of talk of the Easter bunny. And no. And I for one was and I remember I had a problem with the fact that Joe [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2326.9s)]
*  Biden had a white Easter bunny and I noticed that President Trump had a Easter bunny of color and there's yet no praise. Why are we not celebrating. You know and I'm [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2336.82s)]
*  pretty sure that wasn't a D.A.I. brother rabbit. That was that brother was at the top of his rabbit game. And you're the only person that's pointing this out. Well because I'm [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2348.5800000000004s)]
*  also the only person in this room of color. Yes. So it was about time we start getting a little credit where credit's due. He had a black rabbit on Christmas Day light skin. It was [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2358.06s)]
*  maybe even a tyrus rabbit at this point. And I think we need to recognize that because that's part of the cave. Is that he's Hitler. Yeah. And I'm willing to bet that Hitler would not on any given day [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2365.74s)]
*  had a brown rabbit next to him cracking jokes with him. I'm willing to bet the farm on that one. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2377.18s)]
*  Now let's be serious for a moment. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2384.1s)]
*  But that's what they are is and they don't quite they didn't quite understand what KFAME KFAME is like you. You don't expose the secrets. You don't give away the plan. And if you do you blow the spot or the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2390.74s)]
*  worst thing you can hear when you came back from an agent was this wonderful classic phrase. You the bed. And that's exactly he's laughing because it's the last thing as a wrestler you want to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2404.2599999999998s)]
*  hear. You get Arne Anderson going hey kid you just the bed. If I was you don't even change. Just get out. I've had a few of those in my career. And that's what the media has done. They have [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2413.02s)]
*  proverbially the bed. They take everything he says literally. They are the worst kind of wrestling fans. They're the ones that their favorite guy loses and they send them letters like how could you lose. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2422.54s)]
*  You're not training hard enough. Tyrus you are bigger than him. You outweigh him by 100 pounds. And the little Mexican guy Mysterio beat you. I hate you. You're a loser. You've heard it. I and you're sitting there going I don't write bro. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2433.06s)]
*  This is like people who believe like the little ladies who believe that soap operas are actually happening. Yes. Letters to the characters. Yes. This is like the 40 year old that's still setting traps for Santa Claus. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2447.7400000000002s)]
*  So I'm to believe neither of those things. Yes. Yes. That's what you're telling me. I hate to break it. I'm just well my kids go to bed at nine. The ones that I get to watch. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2458.38s)]
*  So I won't be giving away any secrets. All right. Before we go come see me on tour. I'll be in Knoxville Tennessee Highland Heights Kentucky Jacksonville Florida with [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XItJs5K92ok&t=2469.98s)]
