# Fox News Highlights - March 13, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ)
*  Shouting for relevance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Now, during the first Trump term, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=5.9s)]
*  she urged leftists to harass Republicans in public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=7.66s)]
*  And now at age 86, Mad Maxine Waters [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=11.66s)]
*  is sounding even more deranged. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=15.22s)]
*  The equivalent of someone who's just throwing a match [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=17.34s)]
*  on a spill of kerosene. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=20.42s)]
*  I'm worried that Trump is on the edge [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=23.3s)]
*  of creating a civil war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=26.52s)]
*  I believe he expects violence. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=28.02s)]
*  I believe he expects confrontation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  I believe he's working toward a civil war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=32.94s)]
*  We're not gonna get goaded. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=35.74s)]
*  We're not gonna get tricked into that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  Oh, she's out of her mind. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=41.5s)]
*  Trump wants national harmony [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=42.96s)]
*  and a country united behind a new patriotic journey [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=45.16s)]
*  toward peace and prosperity [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=48.42s)]
*  for the middle class, for all Americans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=50.56s)]
*  But of course, nationhood itself, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  that's a threat to the far left. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=55.66s)]
*  They despise America and they don't even believe in borders. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  By extension, they loathe Israel [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=61.3s)]
*  and justify barbaric acts of Islamic terror. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=63.58s)]
*  Now we saw this play out today in Manhattan [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=67.02s)]
*  where the NYPD was forced to get up close and personal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=69.46s)]
*  with pro-Hamas loons who tried to take over Trump Tower. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=72.9s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=77.42s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=79.5s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=81.5s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=83.74s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=85.74s)]
*  Free, free, free Palestine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=87.74s)]
*  All my weapons, all my war. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=89.74s)]
*  Freedom's what we're fighting for. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=91.74s)]
*  Now these protesters have zero ability [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  to engage in an actual debate on issues [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  like immigration or the war in Ukraine [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  or our support for Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=102.6s)]
*  But they are masters at screaming, off key usually, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  sign waving, property damage, and criminal trespass. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  Most are borderline illiterate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=112.54s)]
*  Their chants don't even make sense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=114.62s)]
*  Blue, free them all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=117.62s)]
*  We will not fight on blue. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  We are fighting time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  Fight Nazis, not students. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=124.18s)]
*  Fight Nazis, not students. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=127.14s)]
*  What? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=130.46s)]
*  I don't get that at all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=131.3s)]
*  Fox's Eric Sean tried to engage with them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  This is how that went. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=137.12s)]
*  What are you protesting and why are you here? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=139.02s)]
*  We're here in the name of peace [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=140.86s)]
*  and we're asking for Mahmoud to be released. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=142.66000000000003s)]
*  He was taken illegally by the ICE department. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=145.86s)]
*  He was kidnapped by the United States government. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=150.46s)]
*  The ICE department. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=154.78s)]
*  And the professors at Columbia [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=156.5s)]
*  are just as incapable of coherent thought. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=157.9s)]
*  They don't know immigration law, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=160.62s)]
*  but they try to pass themselves off [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  as intelligent warriors for civil rights. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=164.18s)]
*  His only offense has been exercising [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=167.3s)]
*  his constitutional rights [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=169.78s)]
*  to free speech and peaceful assembly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=171.46s)]
*  Now we're facing a horrifying reality [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=173.62s)]
*  that our own student, a member of the Columbia community, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=176.78s)]
*  has become a political prisoner here in the United States. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=180.82s)]
*  Only political prisoner would it be a conservative [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=186.02s)]
*  on the Columbia campus. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=188.3s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=189.74s)]
*  If national security concerns are implicated, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=191.06s)]
*  determined by our secretary of state, guess what? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=193.54s)]
*  People with green cards, non-citizens, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=196.62s)]
*  can be sent packing, period. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=198.9s)]
*  Read the law. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=200.96s)]
*  Now you may be wondering, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=202.54s)]
*  who's actually behind these protests? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  Who's supporting them? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  Who's funding them? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=207.06s)]
*  The Trump Tower sit-in was organized by the group [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=208.34s)]
*  Jewish Voices for Peace. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=211.58s)]
*  Now it has several chapters on college campuses [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=214.26s)]
*  across America and it bills itself [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=216.5s)]
*  as a home for left-leaning Jews. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=218.86s)]
*  It pushes the BDS movement, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=221.74s)]
*  Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions Against Israel, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=223.66s)]
*  and it gets its biggest funding [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=226.74s)]
*  from groups associated with George Soros, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=231.58s)]
*  and the anti-Israel Kaffen and Lannan Foundations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  That's just to name a few. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  Now remember, Soros himself has his hands [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=238.46s)]
*  in many protest pots, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=240.66s)]
*  stirring up a toxic brew of anti-Semitism [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=242.74s)]
*  and anti-Americanism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  Jerusalem Post writer David Ben Bassat put it starkly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=247.86s)]
*  Soros and his organization pay funds [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  to radical anti-Israel organizations [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=254.54s)]
*  that fuel hatred and encourage protests [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  on campuses across the United States. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=259.78s)]
*  They're funded and organized [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  by branches of Students for Justice in Palestine, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=263.94s)]
*  SJP, supported by Soros, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=267.02s)]
*  and other anti-Israel organizations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, and here's another fun fact. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=272.94s)]
*  Jewish Voices for Peace, JVP, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=275.18s)]
*  had to pay a federal penalty of $677,000 [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=277.5s)]
*  back to the government, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=283.18s)]
*  for misrepresenting itself in a COVID loan application. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=285.74s)]
*  You know, basically not revealing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=290.02s)]
*  that it's essentially does political stuff. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=291.46s)]
*  It just does research, yeah, right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=294.9s)]
*  But none of this matters. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=296.86s)]
*  None of the facts matter to the crazies, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=298.78s)]
*  because these people don't care about the facts, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=301.7s)]
*  and they don't really care about the law. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=304.5s)]
*  This is all driven by emotion [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=307.22s)]
*  and by propaganda fed to them online [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=309.38s)]
*  and on college campuses, in the classroom and beyond. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=311.78s)]
*  And if they could, a lot of these students [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=315.34s)]
*  would have majored in protesting. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=316.94s)]
*  And you get the feeling that many of these characters, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=319.38s)]
*  for many of them, protesting, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=322.26s)]
*  is almost a substitute for socializing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=324.38s)]
*  It gives them a sense of belonging, a sense of community. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=327.78s)]
*  It's their entire reason for being. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=331.26s)]
*  Stop the bombs and the killing! [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=334.14s)]
*  Fight like hell for the living! [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=336.46s)]
*  Stop the bombs and the killing! [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=338.9s)]
*  Fight like hell for the living! [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=341.14000000000004s)]

*  These are all things Democrats argued [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=700.5s)]
*  a president had no control over. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=702.18s)]
*  Then how'd all these things happen [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=705.14s)]
*  when we got a new president? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=706.5s)]
*  Democrats were for doge for decades, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=708.78s)]
*  but now that Trump's the one doing the doging, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=711.34s)]
*  they're standing up for waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=713.94s)]
*  Until today, USDA was funding a $397,000 grant [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=717.18s)]
*  in the San Francisco Bay Area to educate queer, trans, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=721.98s)]
*  and BIPOC urban farmers and consumers about food justice. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=726.22s)]
*  So if you're a straight urban farmer, you don't get money. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  Only a queer urban farmer gets money. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=735.02s)]
*  400 grand for a pack of seeds, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=738.06s)]
*  some gardening gloves, and a watering can. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=740.26s)]
*  You know how much mulch you can buy for $400,000? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  They're stealing the money. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=746.14s)]
*  If we can doge queer urban garden grants, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=748.06s)]
*  we could probably balance the budget. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=750.78s)]
*  When the president balances the budget, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=753.46s)]
*  his first move is going to be, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=756.1s)]
*  he has suggested that he would like to waive taxes [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=758.5s)]
*  for people under $150,000. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=761.3s)]
*  That's aspirational, that when we balance the budget, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  and let me tell you, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=767.58s)]
*  he's got a plan to balance this budget. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=768.58s)]
*  Trump wants to doge taxes for the working class, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=771.46s)]
*  and Democrats are breaking into Trump Tower [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=773.78s)]
*  screaming to free a radical Muslim. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=777.1s)]
*  Imagine how great this country would be [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=779.82s)]
*  if we could all work together, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=781.58s)]
*  and Democrats didn't just oppose to oppose. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=783.14s)]
*  CNBC is mad about the market and blames Trump's tariffs, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=786.26s)]
*  but there's a method to the madness. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=790.02s)]
*  Yesterday General Motors was in, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=792.5s)]
*  they want to invest $60 billion. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=794.02s)]
*  The people from Facebook were in yesterday. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=798.34s)]
*  They're going to invest $60 billion by the end of the year. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=800.86s)]
*  The US, you know, a few days ago [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=803.54s)]
*  announced $500 billion investment. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=806.14s)]

*  which as you know, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=811.2199999999999s)]
*  almost all of their plants are in China. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=812.2199999999999s)]
*  Now they're building in the United States. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=814.4599999999999s)]
*  This trade war, which is what, in its second week, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=816.5s)]
*  is already bringing in money, jobs, and manufacturing. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=819.2199999999999s)]
*  Politicians lost 100,000 manufacturing plants [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=822.3399999999999s)]

*  The S&P's off 10% now, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=831.5799999999999s)]

*  The S&P had a stretch where it fell off 10% just last year, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=835.3399999999999s)]
*  and another 10% dipped the year before. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=838.98s)]
*  It happens. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=841.9s)]
*  It's going to take a minute to bring manufacturing back. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=843.42s)]
*  It's the only thing both parties agree on. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=846.18s)]
*  The media never panics [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=850.4599999999999s)]
*  when we lost the muscle of American industry. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=851.8199999999999s)]
*  As long as equities were up, the media was happy. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=855.5799999999999s)]
*  Who cares about American jobs and wages? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=858.18s)]
*  They threw parties for globalization. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=861.2199999999999s)]
*  All the brilliant minds said the Earth was flat [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=863.62s)]

*  Not so fast. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=868.78s)]

*  Today, we started a booze war. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=888.3399999999999s)]
*  The Europeans didn't like our steel tariff, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=890.18s)]
*  so they put a 50% tariff on whiskey. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=891.9399999999999s)]
*  47 doesn't drink, so we just put a 200% tariff [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=895.14s)]
*  on all European wines and champagne, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=898.5s)]
*  which will probably break the French, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=900.86s)]
*  and they'll surrender like usual. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=902.5s)]
*  Looks like for now, Jesse Waters [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=905.02s)]
*  won't be buying any more Bordeaux, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=906.5s)]

*  to build a new facility. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=995.74s)]

*  let companies move offshore, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1037.38s)]

*  Bidenomics out of the system. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump's not creating a recession, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1046.1000000000001s)]
*  he's preventing a Great Depression. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1047.74s)]
*  We were always gonna have a transition [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1050.18s)]
*  from this incredible unsustainable level [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1052.0600000000002s)]
*  of government spending that we had. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1055.98s)]
*  I think last week I called it a detox. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1057.7800000000002s)]
*  The easy thing for us to have done [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1060.14s)]
*  would have been to come in and just keep [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1062.18s)]
*  this massive spending level going. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1064.42s)]
*  And it's unsustainable, but could we have kept it going [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1068.14s)]
*  for a year, two years, maybe even four? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1070.9s)]
*  Maybe, but you're risking a financial calamity. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1073.26s)]
*  The media sees this trade war as undisciplined [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1077.14s)]
*  and haphazard because they don't listen [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1079.34s)]
*  to what the White House says, but I do. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1081.46s)]

*  a secure border, and fair trade [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1086.58s)]

*  wages, and profits and make your portfolio [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1091.54s)]

*  You can call this market growing pains. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1097.74s)]
*  We're also expanding geographically. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1100.78s)]
*  Canada only works as a state. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1103.58s)]
*  It doesn't, we don't need anything they have. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1105.3s)]
*  As a state, it would be one of the great states anyway. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1108.3s)]
*  This would be the most incredible country visually. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1111.1s)]
*  If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1114.4199999999998s)]
*  right through it between Canada and the U.S. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1116.94s)]
*  Just a straight artificial line. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1119.82s)]
*  Somebody did it a long time ago, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1121.7s)]
*  many, many decades ago, and makes no sense. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1124.7s)]
*  It's so perfect as a great and cherished state, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1129.3s)]

*  But it'll be for the state, one of our greatest states. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1141.3s)]
*  Maybe our greatest. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1143.8600000000001s)]
*  Trump's White House is even asking the Pentagon [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1144.7s)]
*  to develop military options for the Panama Canal. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1146.5800000000002s)]
*  The Panamanian military can either work with us [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1149.7s)]
*  or work for us, if you know what I mean. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1152.78s)]
*  And Greenland's basically inevitable. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1155.34s)]
*  Greenland, what is your vision [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1158.1s)]
*  for the potential annexation of Greenland [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1160.66s)]
*  and getting them potentially to... [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1163.98s)]
*  Well, I think it'll happen, and I'm just thinking, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1166.3s)]
*  I didn't give it much thought before, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1169.74s)]
*  but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1171.78s)]
*  You know, Mark, we need that for international security. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1174.58s)]
*  Look at this map right here. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1178.34s)]
*  Doesn't that make sense? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1180.1s)]
*  See Greenland, see Russia, see Alaska and Canada. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1181.18s)]
*  This great game is gonna move [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1185.1000000000001s)]
*  from the Mideast to the Arctic. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1186.7s)]
*  And Trump knows precious real estate when he sees it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1188.22s)]
*  Bernie Sanders says it's the scariest time [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1191.26s)]
*  he's ever seen since he's been alive, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1194.5s)]
*  but it's shaping up to be the most exciting. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1197.1000000000001s)]
*  America's gonna become more lethal, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1199.98s)]
*  more economically strong, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1202.46s)]
*  and we're participating in that and we're thrilled. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1203.9s)]
*  The part I love is that we're winning. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1206.1000000000001s)]
*  The part I love almost more is that we're getting [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1207.6200000000001s)]
*  to do our usual, humiliate the critics of power here. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1210.14s)]
*  And it makes my life a lot of fun. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1214.38s)]
*  America is the greatest experiment, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1216.0200000000002s)]
*  the greatest country that has existed, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1218.22s)]
*  and we must support it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1220.8200000000002s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity, and tonight we are inching closer [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1224.0200000000002s)]
*  and closer to peace in Europe [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  as President Trump now attempts a heavy lift. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1228.38s)]
*  And that would be a historic deal to end the death, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1231.1000000000001s)]
*  the destruction that has been taking place in this war [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1234.7800000000002s)]
*  with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1237.38s)]
*  And here at home, in spite of all the media hype [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1239.1s)]
*  and hysteria and screaming and yelling and ranting [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1242.34s)]
*  and raving, we have a lot of great news on the economy. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1245.54s)]
*  Prices are coming down nationwide, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1248.5s)]
*  and American manufacturing, it's making a massive comeback. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1250.86s)]
*  And in about 24 hours, two American astronauts [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1254.1399999999999s)]
*  who are stranded in space by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1258.2199999999998s)]
*  will hopefully, we pray, hitch a ride back to Earth [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1262.02s)]
*  with Elon Musk and SpaceX. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1265.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats can't seem to do anything [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1267.66s)]
*  or help anyone, in fact, they can't even help themselves. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1269.78s)]
*  Tomorrow at midnight, Senate Democrats, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1272.94s)]
*  well, as of a day and a half ago, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1275.38s)]
*  a promise to shut down the federal government. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1278.02s)]
*  And Chuckie Schumer, our old friend himself, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1281.18s)]
*  is the latest victim of the power of President Trump. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1283.42s)]
*  Also, a lot of credit to the majority leader, John Thune, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1286.3400000000001s)]
*  who has steadfastly called his bluff and challenged him [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  and outmaneuvered him ever since he took charge. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1293.14s)]
*  But there are now signs that the Schumer shutdown [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1295.86s)]
*  is falling apart and Schumer's about to cave himself. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1298.8999999999999s)]
*  While it is not totally clear how the Democrats will vote, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1302.3s)]
*  well, we appear to be headed towards [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1305.34s)]
*  another massive Trump win and another humiliation [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1307.74s)]
*  for the dying on the vine Democratic Party. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1310.98s)]
*  Yesterday, Schumer publicly announcing [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1313.86s)]
*  that he would block the Republicans' funding bill, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1316.1s)]
*  he would shut down the government. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1318.6599999999999s)]
*  But today, during a closed door meeting, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1320.46s)]
*  Schumer reportedly told his colleagues [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1322.3s)]
*  that he would now vote to advance [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1324.62s)]
*  the Republican spending plan after reports [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1326.4599999999998s)]
*  of a lot of screaming and yelling and infighting [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1329.58s)]
*  all behind closed doors. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1332.9799999999998s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, that screaming was so loud, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1335.1s)]
*  it was heard on floors beneath [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1338.3s)]
*  where that meeting was taking place. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1340.82s)]
*  Senate Democrats, they became emotional, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1342.86s)]
*  they became unhinged, this time against each other. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1344.86s)]
*  They are now facing a catch-22. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1348.3s)]
*  On the one hand, they want to sow as much chaos [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1349.9799999999998s)]
*  and hatred under Donald Trump as humanly possible. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1352.74s)]
*  They want to make life painful for everyone in America. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1355.42s)]
*  They are basically cheering for America to fail. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1358.22s)]
*  But on the other hand, they worship the federal government [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1360.5s)]
*  and they spent the last decade vilifying [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1363.82s)]
*  government shutdowns as evil and horrible [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1367.14s)]
*  and cruel and terrible and mean. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1369.54s)]
*  In fact, this is what Chuck Schumer himself [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1371.74s)]
*  thought about government shutdowns until very recently [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1373.82s)]
*  when he supported this one yesterday, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1376.98s)]
*  but seems to be flipping and flopping today [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1379.3s)]
*  because of Donald Trump. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1381.8999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1382.9399999999998s)]
*  Spare innocent, hardworking Americans [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1384.26s)]
*  the pain of an unnecessary Trump shutdown. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1386.78s)]
*  So mean-spirited. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1390.4599999999998s)]
*  It ought to end and it ought to end now. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1392.2199999999998s)]
*  The American people don't want a shutdown. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1394.6599999999999s)]
*  The last thing Americans need right now [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1396.58s)]

*  We are facing a government shutdown [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1445.1399999999999s)]
*  that is totally unnecessary. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  It's service members who are gonna go out [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1448.6599999999999s)]

*  The American people are tired of our country [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1466.62s)]

*  The truth is that shutting down the government [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1483.2199999999998s)]
*  is a serious and dangerous action [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1486.26s)]

*  We have more tape of Chuckie Schumer apparently losing it [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1495.02s)]
*  on MSDNC coming up in a minute. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1498.02s)]
*  Even today, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1499.74s)]
*  spoke out about the horrors of a government shutdown. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1502.3799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1505.46s)]
*  If there is a shutdown, what do you think that would mean [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1507.22s)]
*  for farmers, for ranchers, for consumers? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1509.54s)]
*  Well, none of this is good for farmers and ranchers. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1512.78s)]
*  And the last thing that I wanna see is a shutdown. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1515.78s)]
*  So the last thing she wants to see [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1519.98s)]
*  and yet Klobuchar was apparently ready, willing, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1521.74s)]
*  and able to shut the government down [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1524.78s)]
*  because she hates Donald Trump, of course. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1526.54s)]
*  And because radicals who run her party [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1528.9399999999998s)]
*  think Donald Trump is evil. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1531.1s)]
*  And therefore they must stand against evil, don't they? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1532.78s)]
*  Naturally, Democrats oppose everything that Trump supports. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1535.78s)]
*  President Trump wants to fund the government. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1538.6599999999999s)]
*  Democrats wanna shut it down. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1540.9399999999998s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1542.46s)]
*  President Trump wants peace in Europe and the Middle East. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1543.46s)]
*  Democrats have now become the pro long protracted war party [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1546.1s)]
*  funded by the American people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1550.7s)]
*  President Trump wants to protect women's sports. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1552.54s)]
*  Democrats, they're against it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1555.14s)]
*  President Trump wants to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1556.8600000000001s)]
*  in the federal government to the tune of hundreds [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1559.98s)]
*  of billions of dollars spent abroad on their radical agenda. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1562.06s)]
*  Democrats throw a fit, say we're in a constitutional crisis, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1565.3400000000001s)]
*  start setting Teslas on fire and charging stations on fire [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1569.26s)]
*  and threatening Elon Musk's life [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1573.38s)]
*  before Trump even does anything. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1575.9s)]
*  Even Chuck Schumer demanded waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1578.7s)]
*  at one point be cut out of our federal government. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1581.02s)]
*  Now, let's see, Clinton said it, Gore said it, Obama said it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1583.9s)]
*  And believe it or not, even Chuck Schumer [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1587.5s)]
*  now used to support what Donald Trump is now doing. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1590.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1593.98s)]
*  If we're going to eliminate the waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  it does mean we're gonna cut some of that out. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1600.0600000000002s)]
*  And when I hear my friend Dave Camp say, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1602.74s)]
*  you cannot cut money out of Medicare, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1605.3000000000002s)]
*  well, we don't want to cut the good stuff that you point out [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1608.34s)]
*  or prevent or add the prevention. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1611.54s)]
*  But if we're gonna, if one third, if what Senator Coburn says, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1613.7s)]
*  that one third of Medicare doesn't go to patient care, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1618.18s)]
*  you can't just get up there and say, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1622.1s)]
*  we don't want to cut anything out of Medicare. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1623.78s)]
*  We want to cut the bad stuff and keep the good stuff. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1625.34s)]
*  And I think that's where we can find common ground. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1628.18s)]
*  See, sounds like Elon Musk. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1632.02s)]
*  You better be careful. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1633.86s)]
*  They're gonna be threatening him next. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1634.86s)]
*  Anyway, now Democrats put the rights of illegals [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1636.62s)]
*  above the safety of you, the American people. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1639.06s)]
*  Sadly, what's happened is the Democratic Party [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1641.4599999999998s)]
*  is now ruled by radicals. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1643.62s)]
*  Chuck must bow before them if he wants to stay in power. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1645.6599999999999s)]
*  And people that suffer from a terminal case [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1649.4599999999998s)]
*  of Trump derangement syndrome, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1651.54s)]
*  and there's no space for logic, common sense. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1653.78s)]
*  The old Democratic Party is dead. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1656.9799999999998s)]
*  This is a radicalized party through and through. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1658.7399999999998s)]
*  Anti-Trump hatred and rage. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1661.5s)]
*  Well, that kind of rules the day. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1663.86s)]
*  There's a little bit of soullessness as well. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1665.7s)]
*  If you can't stand for the mothers who lost their children [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1668.9s)]
*  or women that lost their hero law enforcement husbands, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1671.9s)]
*  or even a little young man who's 12 years old to beat cancer. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1676.58s)]
*  The performative chaos, the bingo card [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1682.3400000000001s)]
*  seem to be the only things that matter. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1684.58s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1686.14s)]
*  So if the government shuts down, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1687.66s)]
*  then one of my questions is, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1689.42s)]
*  are they allowed to still fire people? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1692.18s)]
*  In my opinion, if we're shut down, you can't be fired. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1694.74s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1698.42s)]
*  It does mean that people will not be paid, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1699.78s)]
*  but it does mean that they will get their back pay. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1702.26s)]
*  We have the power to stand up for people. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1705.06s)]
*  That is what the House did [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1706.74s)]
*  under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1708.3s)]
*  We gave an almost unanimous vote against this legislation. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1710.78s)]
*  That is what the Senate needs to do. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1714.54s)]
*  And they need to do it right now on this motion to proceed, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1716.42s)]
*  or the cloture vote, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1720.66s)]
*  because that's the vote that requires 60 votes. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1722.1s)]
*  That's the place that Democrats have leverage. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1725.34s)]
*  As bad as all that is, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1729.4199999999998s)]
*  Congressman Maxine Waters took it a step further [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1730.9399999999998s)]
*  and all but predicted a looming civil war in the country. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1733.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay, take a look. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1738.5s)]
*  I'm worried that Trump is on the edge [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1740.74s)]
*  of creating a civil war. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1743.9399999999998s)]
*  He alluded to it more than once. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1746.1399999999999s)]
*  What does Trump expect? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1748.86s)]
*  Oh, I believe he expects violence. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1750.7s)]
*  I believe he expects confrontation. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1753.3s)]
*  I believe he's working toward a civil war. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1755.98s)]
*  We're not gonna get goaded. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1758.78s)]
*  We're not gonna get tricked into that. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1761.06s)]
*  Get, isn't this the woman that said, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1765.5s)]
*  get in their face, follow them into their stores [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1766.5800000000002s)]
*  at the gas station, wherever you go, follow them? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=1769.18s)]

*  Perhaps it's the basement or the attic, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2195.5s)]
*  you know, where you keep it locked up like a feral hog [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2197.7799999999997s)]
*  Anna Navarro keeps in her pantry. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2200.42s)]
*  Americans never used politics as the prism [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2206.14s)]
*  for who we hang out with, where we eat, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2209.5s)]
*  or who we would give a kidney to. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2211.3799999999997s)]
*  And how do you know when politics has superseded life, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2215.06s)]
*  when you won't stand and clap for a kid with cancer? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2218.2999999999997s)]
*  That's almost as bad as lending Jerry Nadler [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2221.58s)]
*  a pair of white underpants. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2223.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2226.8599999999997s)]
*  Don't ask for him back. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2228.18s)]
*  Unless you collect him. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2230.8199999999997s)]
*  But that's the overriding sentiment now [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2232.2999999999997s)]
*  in every facet of life. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2234.22s)]
*  Because they made politics personal. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2235.7799999999997s)]
*  That means while we're enjoying football, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2237.74s)]
*  they're obsessing about how the team name is offensive [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2239.66s)]
*  to marginalized people. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2242.4599999999996s)]
*  Like the Vikings. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2244.3399999999997s)]
*  But we're not thinking politics all day, if at all. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2246.18s)]
*  We're not holding cringy public singing [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2249.8199999999997s)]
*  so that everyone can see how righteous and off key we are. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2252.22s)]
*  We don't inject cliched slogans into every conversation [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2255.4199999999996s)]
*  while telling those who didn't vote for us [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2259.4599999999996s)]
*  that their brains are undeveloped [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2261.7s)]
*  and that in their hearts they're all just racist Nazis. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2263.3s)]
*  But the Dems did. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2266.6200000000003s)]
*  No wonder they were humiliated in November. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2268.02s)]
*  You had it coming. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2270.2200000000003s)]
*  You just told 52% of the electorate [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2271.42s)]
*  that we're either evil or just too stupid [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2273.6200000000003s)]
*  to see how obviously awful everything is, including us. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2276.1400000000003s)]
*  So as you look for advice, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2280.1800000000003s)]
*  the best shrink may be the person you hate most. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2281.54s)]
*  Trump. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2285.54s)]
*  His actions reveal the path forward for the Democrat Party. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2286.5s)]
*  He focused attention on the true priorities of a country. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2290.2599999999998s)]
*  Economy, trade, immigration, crime, taxpayer abuse. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2293.58s)]
*  And no, it's not pronouns, DEI or trance, rights. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2298.54s)]
*  All of that looks absurd by comparison. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2301.8199999999997s)]
*  Hell, they're absurd on their own. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2305.1s)]
*  They're just phony theater kid obsessions [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2307.1s)]
*  that no adult takes seriously. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2309.18s)]
*  So you can't make any progress [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2312.02s)]
*  until you replace your tortured aims [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2313.2599999999998s)]
*  with ones rooted in reality. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2315.62s)]
*  The question is, can you? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2317.8599999999997s)]
*  Or has the virus replaced the host? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2319.66s)]
*  Cause it's time to look back in that mirror [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2322.2599999999998s)]
*  and admit to yourself, it's too late for a new look. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2324.06s)]
*  It's time for a new me. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2327.46s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2329.8999999999996s)]
*  In high school, he was voted most likely to pay alimony. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2334.3399999999997s)]
*  Actor, writer, comedian, Jamie LaSalle. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2337.74s)]
*  He's the inventor of the hands-free prostate exam. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2342.3799999999997s)]
*  Chief patient officer at the wellness company, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2345.8199999999997s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2347.94s)]
*  Her favorite snack is a knuckle sandwich. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2350.66s)]
*  UFC reporter, Charlie Arnold. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2353.62s)]
*  And bears give each other tyrus hugs. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2357.8599999999997s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2361.3399999999997s)]
*  and former NWA world champion. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2362.8999999999996s)]
*  Jamie, here's a fun question to ask written by my staff. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2369.58s)]
*  What's more likely, another Democrat president [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2373.8199999999997s)]
*  or you, Jamie, living a happy life [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2377.2599999999998s)]
*  with a successful career and ex-wives who don't hate you [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2379.54s)]
*  and your children actually loving you again? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2383.4599999999996s)]
*  I would say both very unlikely. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2386.98s)]
*  You're so right though. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2390.58s)]
*  What a great model. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2391.4199999999996s)]
*  So many great points. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2392.58s)]
*  It's not a messaging problem, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2393.54s)]
*  Like once you ruin your credibility, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2395.3399999999997s)]
*  you can't just try to like pull the wool over someone's eyes [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2396.9399999999996s)]
*  and make them forget. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2399.2599999999998s)]
*  If you have a good product, Trump has a good product. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2400.14s)]
*  It's almost like he doesn't need messaging or branding, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2402.22s)]
*  right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2404.06s)]
*  He just does what he says he can do. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2404.8999999999996s)]
*  This is a random example, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2406.1s)]
*  but say your ex-wife cheated on you. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2408.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2410.06s)]
*  It will be like then a year later, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2412.54s)]
*  her going, hey, I'm going for a girl's weekend [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2414.18s)]
*  and expecting her not to track her phone, right? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2417.5s)]
*  Because you have a precedence for that, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2420.02s)]
*  which by the way, I have done that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2421.94s)]
*  I did track her phone once. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2423.18s)]
*  It yielded nothing. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2425.02s)]
*  It turns out she just went to some hotel room [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2425.98s)]
*  and jumped up and down on the bed. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2428.2599999999998s)]
*  Harmless, harmless fun. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2432.94s)]
*  But isn't it almost like Bud Light? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2434.58s)]
*  I feel like if Bud Light was a great beer, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2436.14s)]
*  people would still drink Bud Light, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2438.34s)]
*  but it was so about branding. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2439.66s)]
*  Remember Bud Light? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2441.06s)]
*  They made these huge mistakes and then they tried to go, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2441.9s)]
*  remember they did all those American ads, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2443.94s)]
*  like it was like a horse running. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2445.42s)]
*  They wanted to distract you from what was going on. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2447.06s)]
*  They're like, hey, look, a horse expecting you to look up. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2449.1s)]
*  Remember like the Dylan Mulvaney on the can and everything? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2451.46s)]
*  I remember when I first saw that, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2453.86s)]
*  when I saw that Dylan Mulvaney can, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2455.34s)]
*  I didn't hear about the story. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2457.02s)]
*  I just bought a six pack and I brought it home. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2457.98s)]
*  And I thought it was like, I thought it was like a warning. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2459.98s)]
*  I thought it was like, hey, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2463.06s)]
*  John Matherl was like, hey, drink too many of these. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2465.46s)]
*  You might be with a woman with a penis, so be careful. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2467.18s)]
*  By the way. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2472.5s)]
*  Words to live by. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2473.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2474.18s)]
*  Dr. Drew, Jamie makes an interesting analogy [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2475.9s)]
*  that the Democratic Party in a way is like Bud Light. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2478.74s)]
*  Like how does it, and so how do you rebrand it [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2482.8199999999997s)]
*  if it's like you can't, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2486.46s)]
*  you're not gonna change the beer, I guess. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2487.66s)]
*  The beer is no good, the messaging doesn't matter. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2489.42s)]
*  And people are tired of the messaging. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2491.34s)]
*  They wanna be left alone. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2493.9s)]
*  The messaging, by the way, has been, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2494.98s)]
*  you're a bad person, you're a racist, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2496.5s)]
*  you're whatever, fill in the blank. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2498.1s)]
*  And then hysteria around the edges. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2499.7400000000002s)]
*  People wanna get on with their life, they want governance. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2502.7000000000003s)]
*  They want roads, they want economy, they want healthcare, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  they want defense, and then be left alone. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2507.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2509.6600000000003s)]
*  It's really what people want. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2510.5s)]
*  And same thing from Dylan Mulvaney, leave us alone. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2511.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2513.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, Charlie though, the thing is, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2514.5s)]
*  the Dems can't actually go into the world of common sense [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2516.58s)]
*  because that's all staked out. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2519.58s)]
*  So they kinda are stuck on the outside [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2521.2200000000003s)]
*  with peripheral issues. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2524.42s)]
*  So maybe the party's doomed. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2526.1s)]
*  I think the party is doomed. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2529.14s)]
*  This week they're actually getting together [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2530.42s)]
*  for their annual issues meeting. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2531.74s)]
*  They like to call it their annual policy retreat, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2534.14s)]
*  but I feel like for it to be a retreat, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2536.7s)]
*  it has to be peaceful and relaxing. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2538.66s)]
*  So that doesn't really make sense to me [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2540.06s)]
*  to call it a retreat. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2541.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they have just taken such a hard stance [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2543.54s)]
*  on such insane points of view, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2546.34s)]
*  where they're just trying to grab at straws [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2550.7799999999997s)]
*  for the people that don't align themselves with Trump, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2554.26s)]
*  the people that aren't of the common sense camp, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2555.98s)]
*  come on this way. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2558.2200000000003s)]
*  But there's more to it, and Jamie, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2559.06s)]
*  I think you alluded to it. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2560.66s)]
*  It's a credibility issue. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2562.1s)]
*  It's not just messaging and taking these strong stances. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2563.02s)]
*  There's something super simple they could do. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2565.1s)]
*  Just listen to Federman. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2567.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2568.42s)]
*  I mean, he's saying things that make sense. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2569.26s)]
*  Just go along with that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2571.5s)]
*  Start there. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  Start with that. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2573.58s)]
*  Well, they've just been lying, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2574.42s)]
*  outright lying for so long. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2575.9s)]
*  I mean, even choosing to run a dead man [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2577.66s)]
*  as the leader of the greatest country in the world, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2579.94s)]
*  rather than putting voters... [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2582.7799999999997s)]
*  We haven't even seen him. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2585.4199999999996s)]
*  Best interests first, right? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2586.7799999999997s)]
*  Are you sure they didn't bury him by accident, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2588.62s)]
*  not Jimmy Carter? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2590.62s)]
*  We have no idea at this point. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2594.66s)]
*  We don't. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2595.8199999999997s)]
*  We need to dig up Carter. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2596.66s)]
*  And then there's also the issue [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  of just them being complete hypocrites. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2599.74s)]
*  I mean, for so long, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2601.3799999999997s)]
*  they have been the party of censorship. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2602.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2604.18s)]
*  Censor this, censor that. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2605.02s)]
*  We don't want any misinformation, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2605.8399999999997s)]
*  but now when it comes to this Hamas sympathizer, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2607.06s)]
*  Mehmed Khalil, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2609.3799999999997s)]
*  now you have Susan Sarandon coming out and saying, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2610.7s)]
*  oh my goodness, freedom of expression. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2612.7799999999997s)]
*  We need to acquit this young man [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2614.74s)]
*  because he doesn't deserve this type of punishment. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2616.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's just like, they are such hypocrites. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2618.8199999999997s)]
*  They can't get out of their own way. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2620.8199999999997s)]
*  They need a complete overhaul [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2621.98s)]
*  if they hope to have any success in the future. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2623.7s)]
*  The worst thing about that guy... [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2625.58s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2627.4199999999996s)]
*  The worst thing about that guy is not that [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2631.1s)]
*  he's a Hamas supporter, he's a 31-year-old student. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2633.06s)]
*  Tyrus. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2636.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2637.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh, he's a student. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2638.4199999999996s)]
*  He's a 31-year-old. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2639.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's not what we call them. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2642.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2644.5s)]
*  I believe the term was loser. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2645.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2646.74s)]
*  So, like the guy's been off the football team [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2647.58s)]
*  for four years, but he's still hanging out around the dorms. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2651.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2654.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, other than getting you beer [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2655.14s)]
*  before you can get it yourself, he's a loser. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2656.5s)]
*  No, I disagree a little bit. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2660.2599999999998s)]
*  They're not Bud Light. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2662.2599999999998s)]
*  They're not, because we were fine with Bud Light. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2663.46s)]
*  We were fine with drinking a marginally good beer [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2666.46s)]
*  that makes you piss a lot. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2668.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2669.74s)]
*  And then what happened was, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2670.7799999999997s)]
*  then a progressive activist got involved [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2672.14s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, and they showed up, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2676.34s)]
*  and they made us realize that suddenly [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2678.02s)]
*  this beer doesn't taste that good, it's not worth it, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2679.98s)]
*  because one person, one person decided to tell us [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2682.66s)]
*  what was wrong with us. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2687.22s)]
*  It was too fratty, it was too manny. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2688.14s)]
*  And then we were like, cool, we're not buying it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2690.7s)]
*  So, and so they became the victim, she became the victim. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2693.02s)]
*  America doesn't see the good they're doing. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2697.22s)]
*  They're virtue signaling. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2699.58s)]
*  That's why they won't change, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2701.06s)]
*  because they finally get to be [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2702.7s)]
*  what they've been pretending to be, is they're the victims. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2704.7s)]
*  Kamala didn't get in because, you know, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2708.7s)]
*  there was too many mean white guys, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2710.78s)]
*  and apparently they have new black friends [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2712.3s)]
*  who voted against them. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2714.18s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2715.42s)]
*  So they're still in the phase of like, we're survivors. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2716.34s)]
*  And then when they see each other with their masks on [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2719.82s)]
*  outside, they give the look like, because they're victims. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2722.34s)]
*  And that's why this party doesn't get it, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2726.42s)]
*  until they realize the Democratic Party has to, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2728.38s)]
*  since they are jackasses, kick the asses out. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2731.1s)]
*  And that is all of the people who are there, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2735.86s)]
*  the virtue signaling activists. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2737.98s)]
*  As long as there's activists in their party, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2739.34s)]
*  they can't win anything, but I don't think they want to. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2741.06s)]
*  I think they get as much done bitching and crying [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2743.5s)]
*  and getting funding, those are gonna take care of that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2745.74s)]
*  But like, it's a money-making thing to be the victim. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2747.98s)]
*  So it's just the victim party. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2750.46s)]
*  Democrats, where you went? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2752.14s)]
*  Because you've got the victim party. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2753.34s)]
*  As long as they're victims though, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2754.5s)]
*  the rest of us have to be the victimizers [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2755.66s)]
*  and we're tired of it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2757.46s)]
*  Well then that's why I don't mind being the abuser [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2758.3s)]
*  in that situation, because when they start crying, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2762.34s)]
*  I just say, shut the fuck up, I don't care. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2764.42s)]
*  That also works as a new father. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2768.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2771.26s)]
*  Kidding. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne-2eUqhrVQ&t=2772.1s)]
