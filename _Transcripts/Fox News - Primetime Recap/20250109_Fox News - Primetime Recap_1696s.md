# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 8, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc)
*  California on fire, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the live pictures coming out of the LA area [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=4.24s)]
*  are heartbreaking as we discussed with James Woods. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=6.88s)]
*  Firefighters are bravely battling the flames. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=9.64s)]
*  And as we just heard in impossibly windy conditions. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=12.52s)]
*  When this nightmare finally ends, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=27.62s)]
*  thousands of families who two days ago [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=29.9s)]
*  were just blissfully going about their everyday lives [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  will have lost everything. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=35.46s)]
*  Now some have evacuated with only a few moments [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  to round up their children, grab essential documents [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=39.76s)]
*  and maybe their animals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=42.54s)]
*  How many more horses do you have? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  We have a couple we just let loose over there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=46.18s)]
*  We're trying to get as many as we can out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=48.22s)]
*  Are any homes out there on fire? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=50.78s)]
*  Ozzie, I did not pay attention. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=53.3s)]
*  I just drove straight to the barn to get my horses out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=55.099999999999994s)]
*  and get the rest of these guys out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=57.06s)]
*  I'm going to let the bird. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=59.26s)]
*  How much would you say that you've lost? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=60.42s)]
*  Everything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=62.22s)]
*  I got my car, whatever's in my car. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=64.1s)]
*  I hope the feral cat's okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=66.18s)]
*  She lives in the neighborhood, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=67.78s)]
*  so hopefully she made it out safely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=68.98s)]
*  Roadways filled with abandoned cars [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=72.06s)]
*  showed the desperation of motorists [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=74.02s)]
*  who chose to run for their lives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=76.06s)]
*  At the bottom of the canyon, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  there was cars piled on top of each other. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=80.1s)]
*  There was boulders and debris that fell off the canyon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=83.34s)]
*  that was on fire that was in the middle of the road [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=88.18s)]
*  where people had to abandon their cars. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=90.94s)]
*  Now, the scope of this loss is unfathomable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=94.18s)]
*  Although thankfully the death toll currently is fairly low, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=97.74s)]
*  there are many more injured. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=100.86s)]
*  But forget the climate fanatics [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=103.5s)]
*  because natural disasters are always going to happen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=105.1s)]
*  Hurricanes, floods, mudslides, droughts, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=107.82s)]
*  and yes, wildfires. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=111.62s)]
*  But disasters and leadership [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=114.14s)]
*  can make what is naturally occurring even worse. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=116.3s)]
*  And California has suffered more than it should [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  because it has screwed up priorities from top to bottom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=122.74s)]
*  Were you guys prepared enough for this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=128.82s)]
*  Did we have enough resources to fight these fires? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=130.5s)]
*  No, LA County and all 29 fire departments in our county [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=132.94s)]
*  are not prepared for this type of widespread disaster. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=138.06s)]
*  There are not enough firefighters in LA County [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=142.74s)]
*  to address four separate fires of this magnitude. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=145.5s)]
*  We're doing the very best we can, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=149.58s)]
*  but no, we don't have enough fire personnel in LA County [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  between all of the departments to handle this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  California residents and businesses [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  are among the most highly taxed in the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=163.02s)]
*  And yet we just heard there are not enough fire personnel? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=167.3s)]
*  Well, naturally the public's frustration and fury [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=172.62s)]
*  is beginning to show. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=174.94s)]
*  I don't know where my mayor was when this was happening. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=176.54s)]
*  Nobody told us where to go, what to do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=180.34s)]
*  I didn't even have an evacuation order. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  I love the fire department. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=184.9s)]
*  I love our fire personnel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=186.74s)]
*  We need more. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=189.7s)]
*  Where were they? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=191.06s)]
*  Well, of course we do know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=193.34s)]
*  where California liberals choose to spend billions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=194.42s)]
*  And we do know that their environmental fanaticism [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=197.66s)]
*  has shoved common sense thinking out the door. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=200.46s)]
*  Now, while the winds this week are horrific, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=203.94s)]
*  experts insist that bad forest management [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=205.98s)]
*  can make a bad situation worse. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=209.42s)]
*  And Trump called this out six years ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=211.9s)]
*  California ought to get their act together [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  and clean up their forests and manage their forests [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=216.46s)]
*  because it's disgraceful. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=219.1s)]
*  What's happening should never happen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=220.74s)]
*  I go all over the country and I meet with governors. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=222.18s)]
*  The first thing they say is there's no reason [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=225.02s)]
*  for forest fires like that in California. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=226.7s)]
*  It's costing our country hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=228.78s)]
*  because of incompetence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=232.5s)]
*  He's right, incompetence kills. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=234.82s)]
*  And it's not just the refusal to clear the underbrush. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=237.54s)]
*  As early as last night, firefighters, as James said, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=240.3s)]
*  were reporting finding hydrants without any water, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=244.02s)]
*  happened throughout the Pacific Palisades. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=247.14s)]
*  And the situation continued into today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=249.5s)]
*  That crew, Jake, has now left. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=252.54s)]
*  They left shortly after we did that interview. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=255.22s)]
*  They simply, there was nothing more they could do here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=258.42s)]
*  They didn't have the water to do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=260.54s)]
*  This is a slightly uphill area, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=263.1s)]
*  so that's probably what has contributed now [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=264.94s)]
*  to the water problem here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=266.66s)]
*  So why the lack of water? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=269.82s)]
*  Well, I think we should ask Governor Newsom [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=272.58s)]
*  because his focus has been shrinking the water supply [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  by removing four huge dams in his state. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=278.22s)]
*  I'm here to explain what we're doing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=281.62s)]
*  with the largest river restoration project in US history. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, the Klamath River once supported [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=286.66s)]
*  one of the largest runs of salmon [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=288.02s)]
*  on the Western United States. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=289.82s)]
*  The dams along the Klamath River block salmon from migrating, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  damaging our ecosystems and hurting native communities [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=295.1s)]
*  who rely on these fish. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=298.22s)]
*  So work is already underway to take those dams out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=299.54s)]
*  By removing the dams, we're helping to restore salmon, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=303.14s)]
*  steelhead, and lamprey populations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=305.62s)]
*  Fish lives matter. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=309.58s)]
*  Well, native culture matters. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  But what about the people who need the water [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=313.62s)]
*  in a time of crisis? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=316.5s)]
*  Could full reservoirs created by some of these dams [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=318.66s)]
*  now prohibited under California regulations, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=321.42s)]
*  could that have helped? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=323.74s)]
*  Again, Trump warned about this with Joe Rogan [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  before the election. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=328.06s)]
*  They said, we have no water. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=329.66s)]
*  I said, do you have a drought? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=331.7s)]
*  No, we don't have a drought. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  I said, why don't you have no water? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=334.18s)]
*  Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=335.42s)]
*  It's got a natural flow from Canada [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  all the way up north of water, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=339.98s)]
*  more water than they could ever use. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  And in order to protect a tiny little fish, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=347.98s)]
*  Of course, we haven't even mentioned [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=353.5s)]
*  the idiotic DEI priorities that have infected [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=354.82s)]
*  the hiring of senior personnel throughout the state. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=357.38s)]
*  The Fire Chief of LA, I'm sure, is doing her best, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=360.82s)]
*  but of all the challenges facing California, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=363.74s)]
*  she has made a point of focusing on diversity and inclusion, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=367.06s)]
*  because fires care about the color of your skin, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=372.54s)]
*  or your gender, or your sexual preference. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=376.18s)]
*  The city of Los Angeles [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=379.82s)]
*  swore in a new Fire Chief yesterday, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=381.3s)]
*  and for the first time in history of the department, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=383.14s)]
*  she is a woman. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=386.14s)]
*  Kristen Crowley will lead the nation's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=387.7s)]
*  third largest firefighting force in our second biggest city [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=389.5s)]
*  as a push for diversity continues in a male-dominated field. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=393.18s)]
*  It's a really perfect position to start [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=396.54s)]
*  and to prioritize that work environment, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=400.74s)]
*  especially from the diversity, equity, and inclusion side. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=403.54s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=408.42s)]
*  Now, maybe she can tell us if she still thinks [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=409.66s)]
*  sending surplus firefighting equipment to Ukraine [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=412.18s)]
*  was also a good idea, because they did that too. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=416.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  And to add insult to injury, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=421.66s)]
*  the Biden administration sent another $500 million [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=423.18s)]
*  in weapons to Ukraine today. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  So the people of California [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=430.22s)]
*  are going to need billions in aid to recover from this, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=432.82s)]
*  but we're sending $500 million to Ukraine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=436.82s)]
*  We shipped our excess equipment, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  firefighting equipment, to Ukraine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=443.26s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=446.1s)]
*  Biden should be ashamed of himself. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=448.1s)]
*  Newsom should be ashamed of himself. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=450.02s)]
*  DEI, illegal immigrants, that is a priority for California. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  Sanctuary City spending billions on those. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=456.86s)]
*  That's a priority for California. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=459.34s)]
*  Obviously, environmental concerns, the climate fanatics, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=462.22s)]
*  that's a priority for California. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=465.42s)]
*  But the people of California who need water [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=467.66s)]
*  when their homes are burning, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=471.06s)]
*  when their livestock is threatened, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=472.54s)]
*  when their businesses are at risk of burning to the ground, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=474.38000000000005s)]
*  apparently, they're out of luck. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=477.26000000000005s)]
*  So yes, they should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  But of course, none of them have any shame. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=482.42s)]
*  It's America last, as usual. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=484.98s)]
*  And by the way, no one thought Biden's briefing today [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=487.70000000000005s)]
*  in Santa Monica is going to reassure [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=490.38s)]
*  a single victim of these fires. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=492.66s)]
*  It was all performative. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=497.54s)]
*  He stood there with a screen in the middle [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=498.82s)]
*  with the fire chief on one side [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=500.82s)]
*  and Biden looking with a dazed look into the screen [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=502.94s)]
*  and the other side of the screen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=506.26s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=507.42s)]
*  So when this crisis is over, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=509.22s)]
*  every politician who prioritized spending billions [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=511.06s)]
*  on woke nonsense or on migrants, sanctuary cities, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=514.3s)]
*  they should be thrown out on their butts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=519.5799999999999s)]
*  They should never work in politics again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, sensible politicians, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  Republicans, common sense Democrats, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=529.3s)]
*  people like John Fetterman, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=532.0999999999999s)]
*  I hope they take this horrible moment [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=534.06s)]
*  to support the people of California and tell them, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=536.74s)]
*  remind them, doesn't have to be this way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=540.06s)]
*  President Trump, Senator Thune, Speaker Johnson, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=543.78s)]
*  all should travel to Los Angeles, help California, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=547.38s)]
*  help them save themselves. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=551.14s)]
*  Politicians out there aren't going to do it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=553.02s)]
*  After these fires are put out, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=555.42s)]
*  it's time for California to come home [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=557.34s)]
*  with a return to common sense. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=560.18s)]
*  This is Los Angeles County. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=562.5s)]
*  Entire neighborhoods are burning. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=564.74s)]
*  Over 10,000 acres in Pacific Palisades alone. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=567.1s)]
*  And the smoke, everyone's breathing is being described [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=570.62s)]
*  as a toxic soup. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=573.06s)]
*  Five people already dead. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=574.94s)]
*  They were burned alive. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=576.78s)]
*  Hundreds of homes have been scorched. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  Listen to actor James Woods. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  I call my neighbor who hadn't evacuated yet. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=583.18s)]
*  I said, go in and check on me. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=586.5s)]
*  He went, he said, the door's open, there's nobody here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=588.02s)]
*  He went in and yelled, he said, no, nobody here. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=591.4599999999999s)]
*  I said, look, just go behind the pantry. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=593.22s)]
*  There's a little room. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=595.22s)]
*  We can see him during the day. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  He likes to sit there because there's a garden. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=598.1s)]
*  He went in and found him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=600.18s)]
*  He'd been left alone. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=601.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  And it turned out the fire department [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=604.78s)]
*  made the new caregiver leave. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=606.54s)]
*  And she just does what she was told. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=608.42s)]
*  They said, we're coming back for him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=610.54s)]
*  Well, they hadn't come back for him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=612.14s)]
*  I'm hoping that they would have, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=615.02s)]
*  but there was so much chaos. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=617.38s)]
*  It was like an inferno. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=618.9s)]
*  Every house was on fire around us. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  And he got him out and the house burned down [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=624.06s)]
*  about an hour later. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  He would have been in there alone. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=629.18s)]
*  It was just... [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=630.9s)]
*  This is the most destructive fire in LA County history. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=635.26s)]
*  And it's still raging. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=637.78s)]
*  0% of the fires have been contained, 0%. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  Winds are whipping up to a hundred miles an hour, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=643.78s)]
*  breathing more and more life into the inferno. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=646.3s)]
*  And over 1,400 firefighters are battling the blaze [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=649.3s)]
*  on the front lines and they haven't slept. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=652.3s)]
*  One says, I'm living proof that you can stay up for 96 hours. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=654.86s)]
*  But they're outmanned and out-equipped. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=659.18s)]
*  The chief says she doesn't have enough firefighters. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=661.38s)]
*  Just months ago, LA mayor, Karen Bass, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=664.5s)]
*  cut funding from the fire department by around $20 million. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=667.26s)]
*  And before that, the LA fire department [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=672.02s)]
*  sent their extra equipment to Ukraine. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=673.82s)]
*  They probably could use some of that equipment now. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=676.62s)]
*  And this is even worse. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=679.7s)]
*  The fire hydrants are dry. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=681.1s)]
*  Here on Lockman Land, there are several homes burning. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=684.02s)]
*  This is the one that firefighters were trying to put out [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=686.5400000000001s)]
*  a little while ago. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=688.7800000000001s)]
*  But you can see right now, it's just kind of out of control. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=690.14s)]
*  Since then, firefighters have lost water pressure on the hydrant. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=692.46s)]
*  So they can't get any more water onto this fire [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=695.7s)]
*  and the ones down the hill because of the water pressure issues. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=698.6600000000001s)]
*  Why isn't there any water coming out of the fire hydrants? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=702.5s)]
*  Los Angeles has had two years of record rainfall. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  It hasn't rained this much year to year since the 1800s. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=709.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=712.94s)]
*  All the rain just washes into the ocean. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=714.02s)]
*  A decade ago, California voted to spend billions [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=717.1s)]
*  on water storage and reservoirs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  Today, Governor Newsom hasn't finished building a single one. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=723.06s)]
*  They've done nothing to store water in a decade. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=727.62s)]
*  Trump was just in California this fall [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  and told Gavin he needed to get it together. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  You have so much water and all those fields [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=735.5799999999999s)]
*  that are right now barren, the farmers, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=737.9s)]
*  would have all the water they needed. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=740.14s)]
*  And you could revert water up into the hills [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=741.9799999999999s)]
*  where you have all the dead forests, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=744.3399999999999s)]
*  where the forests are so brittle. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=745.9s)]
*  Because no places like California. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  I go to Austria. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=749.26s)]
*  The head of Austria tells me, you know, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=751.42s)]
*  we have trees that are much more flammable [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=752.74s)]
*  than what you have in California. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=755.66s)]
*  We never have forest floors [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=757.06s)]
*  because they maintain their forests. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=758.14s)]
*  And you have all that water that could be used to, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=761.1s)]
*  as what they call water flow, where the land would be damp. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=763.86s)]
*  And you'd stop many of these horrible fires. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=770.26s)]
*  Before Donald Trump left office, he signed an order [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=773.42s)]
*  that would funnel more water from Northern California [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=776.18s)]
*  into Southern California. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=778.62s)]
*  Newsom, instead of saying thank you, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=780.3s)]
*  filed a lawsuit to stop it, saying it would kill the smelt. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=782.46s)]
*  If you don't know what a smelt is, neither did we. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=787.18s)]
*  It's a fish the size of your pinky. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=790.18s)]
*  California can't get enough water to fight fires [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=793.14s)]
*  because of a stupid fish. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=795.3s)]
*  We're saving fish instead of people. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=797.1s)]
*  Saving smelt, big business. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=799.42s)]
*  If anything happens to the smelt, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=801.98s)]
*  people lose a lot of money. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=803.54s)]
*  We're paying people to feel like heroes [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=805.46s)]
*  for protecting a fish no one eats. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=807.46s)]
*  But it gets worse. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=810.26s)]
*  Gavin's been tearing down dams. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=811.6600000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=814.46s)]
*  Because the Indians wanted some of their river back [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=815.5400000000001s)]
*  so they could catch salmon. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  Gavin didn't just knock down one dam for the Indians, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=819.7800000000001s)]
*  he knocked down all four. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=822.4200000000001s)]
*  The largest dam removal project in US history [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=824.98s)]
*  and one of the most significant, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=828.82s)]
*  if not the most significant, water restoration projects, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=830.58s)]
*  bringing back salmon and steelhead into this basin. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=835.34s)]
*  And I could be more proud as a father [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=839.1s)]
*  because my kids and their great, great grandkids [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=840.9s)]
*  will have the opportunity to see something [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=843.74s)]
*  that has been here since time in Memorial. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=845.94s)]
*  And it's about dam time. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=849.1s)]
*  Words mean nothing unless you can manifest them. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=851.14s)]
*  You gotta make something real. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=853.1800000000001s)]
*  You gotta make the words visible. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=854.3000000000001s)]
*  We mean business. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=855.94s)]
*  We're gonna be turning this over [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  in a very short period of time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=858.22s)]
*  And these dams were a go-to source for firefighters [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=860.38s)]
*  to pull water from to fight fires up north. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=863.82s)]
*  Gavin's literally tearing down Western civilization [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=866.7800000000001s)]
*  for fish and Indians. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=869.46s)]
*  Nothing against the Indians. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=870.58s)]
*  I love the Indians. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=871.62s)]
*  But really? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=873.0200000000001s)]
*  LA is out of water and the governor's staring at the fire [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=874.74s)]
*  with his hands in his pockets. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=877.9000000000001s)]
*  Now we have a rule about men [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=879.98s)]
*  putting their hands in their pockets, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=881.1s)]
*  but this is neither the time nor the place to discuss it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=882.2600000000001s)]
*  People are trapped, homes and schools are gone. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=885.1s)]
*  And Newsom hasn't contained a single acre. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=888.3800000000001s)]
*  The governor waited 24 hours [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=891.58s)]
*  to send in the National Guard. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=893.14s)]
*  Water management, forest management, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=895.3s)]
*  Gavin doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=897.26s)]
*  Again, Trump warned him about this years ago. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=899.34s)]
*  Gotta take care of the floors. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=903.06s)]
*  You know, the floors of the forest is very important. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=904.46s)]
*  You look at other countries where they do it differently [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=908.1s)]
*  and it's a whole different story. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=911.66s)]
*  It was with the president of Finland [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=914.3s)]
*  that he said we have a much different, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=915.86s)]
*  we're a forest nation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=918.74s)]
*  He called it a forest nation. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=919.74s)]
*  And they spent a lot of time on breaking and cleaning [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=921.86s)]
*  and doing things and they don't have any problem. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=924.82s)]
*  And when it is, it's a very small problem. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=927.98s)]
*  Newsom after the election called an emergency special session [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=930.5s)]
*  in California to Trump-proof the state. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=933.5s)]
*  Not fire-proof it, Trump-proof it, whatever that means. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=936.0600000000001s)]
*  Where are the emergency escape roads [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=940.1400000000001s)]
*  that were supposed to have been built? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=941.74s)]
*  People had to abandon their cars in the middle of the road [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=943.3000000000001s)]
*  and run away from the flames [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=945.86s)]
*  because there's only one way in and one way out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=947.5s)]
*  Why weren't the forest beds treated? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=950.7800000000001s)]
*  Why are we running out of water? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=953.22s)]
*  Joe Biden hasn't helped at all. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=955.5400000000001s)]
*  In October, the Biden administration canceled [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=957.1400000000001s)]
*  crucial controlled burns in California. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=959.46s)]
*  These are critical to forest management, cancel them. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=962.46s)]
*  Today, Biden happened to be in town [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=965.6600000000001s)]
*  because he was supposed to designate [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=967.34s)]
*  another national forest, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=968.74s)]
*  decided that this was the right time to congratulate himself. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  It's down in what's happening. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=974.7800000000001s)]
*  The only one piece of good news, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=977.26s)]
*  my son was out there in the woods. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=978.66s)]
*  They got a notification yesterday [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=980.46s)]
*  that their home was burning around. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=983.38s)]
*  Today, the parents of the baby is still standing [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=985.66s)]
*  when I show it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=988.42s)]
*  The good news is I'm a great grandfather. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=990.1s)]
*  That's enough for today. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=993.42s)]
*  I'm a grandfather. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=994.98s)]
*  Next time I'll call my baby girl or baby boy. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=997.02s)]
*  So I'm gonna remember this day for a long, long time. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1001.14s)]
*  So Hunter's now a grandfather and Joe's a great grandfather. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1005.38s)]
*  I'm sure everybody who lost their homes [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1008.14s)]
*  is excited to hear the news. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1010.02s)]
*  Trump reacted to the fire today saying, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1012.02s)]
*  no water in the fire hydrants, no money in FEMA. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1014.38s)]
*  This is what Joe Biden is leaving me. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1016.98s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1019.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, the mayor of LA has been out of the country [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1020.9s)]
*  the whole time. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1022.98s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass has been in Africa [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1024.02s)]
*  for the inauguration of the president of Ghana. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1025.94s)]
*  What the heck's an American politician doing [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1029.06s)]
*  attending inaugurations in other countries? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1030.98s)]
*  Karen Bass isn't going to her own president's inauguration, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1034.1000000000001s)]
*  but she's going to the president of Ghana's? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1037.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  And didn't make it back home until late this afternoon. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1040.7s)]
*  A reporter caught up with her at LAX. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1043.7s)]
*  Listen. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1046.14s)]
*  An apology for being absent while their homes were burning. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1048.18s)]
*  Do you regret cutting the fire department budget [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1052.3400000000001s)]
*  by millions of dollars, Madam Mayor? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1054.46s)]
*  Have you nothing to say today? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1058.46s)]
*  I'm back at home. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1059.9s)]
*  Have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1062.1399999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1065.78s)]
*  Biden was considering Bass for VP. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1066.8999999999999s)]
*  So who else is running things? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  This right here, ladies and gentlemen? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1073.3799999999999s)]
*  This is the leadership of the LA Fire Department. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1076.06s)]
*  I sure hope they know what they're doing. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1078.34s)]
*  Here's the fire chief. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1080.4599999999998s)]
*  She took time out of her already busy schedule [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1082.58s)]
*  to tell us about her vision for the department's future, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1084.9399999999998s)]
*  one that includes a three-year strategic plan [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1087.98s)]
*  to increase diversity. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1090.5s)]
*  People ask me, well, what number are you looking for? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1092.1s)]
*  I say, I'm not looking for a number. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1094.1399999999999s)]
*  It's never enough. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1095.46s)]
*  Out of 3,300 city firefighters, only 115 are women right now. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1096.4199999999998s)]
*  She's already looking at ways to change that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1101.4199999999998s)]
*  The chief also checks another box [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1103.82s)]
*  when it comes to inclusivity and diversity at this department. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1105.58s)]
*  She's a proud member of the LGBTQ community. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1109.22s)]
*  That just kind of opens the door of people that thought, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1112.74s)]
*  wow, I didn't even know that that was an opportunity for me. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1115.1799999999998s)]
*  So while her department was sending equipment to Ukraine, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1119.3s)]
*  the chief was marching in pride parades, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1122.18s)]
*  which is fine, have all the pride you want, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1124.1s)]
*  but you better make sure you're ready to do your job [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1126.5s)]
*  when it counts. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1128.34s)]

*  wildfires always pose a massive risk. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1234.78s)]

*  they seem totally, completely, utterly unprepared. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1242.82s)]
*  In fact, the city's mayor, Karen Bass, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1245.9799999999998s)]
*  was absolutely nowhere to be found. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1248.5s)]

*  Take a look. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1265.54s)]
*  Do you owe citizens an apology for being absent [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1267.46s)]
*  while their homes were burning? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1269.98s)]

*  No apology for them? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1303.14s)]

*  Careful. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1321.26s)]
*  Well, there's a real mayor of the people, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1330.34s)]
*  but Mayor Bass, Governor Newsom, the federal government, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1332.34s)]
*  they have all failed the people of California. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1335.06s)]
*  Much of the dry brush all across all of Southern California [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1337.62s)]
*  has not been cut back for quite some time. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1342.62s)]
*  They have a science, it's called forestry. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1345.54s)]
*  You have controlled burns. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1348.42s)]
*  You prevent fires like this from happening. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1349.74s)]
*  Now the LA Fire Department, they are understaffed, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1352.34s)]
*  they are underfunded. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1355.46s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass increased, by the way, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1356.86s)]
*  this year's library budget, nearly $15 million, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1359.3s)]
*  while simultaneously she cut the fire department's funding [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1362.22s)]
*  by $17.6 million. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1366.06s)]
*  That was only a couple of months ago. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1368.54s)]
*  The mayor also recently touted a $400 million handout [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1370.46s)]
*  from the Biden administration, $400 million [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1375.34s)]
*  that they allocated for green environmental efforts [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1378.34s)]
*  at the port of Los Angeles. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1382.1799999999998s)]
*  On top of that, they spent another two plus billion dollars [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1385.1399999999999s)]
*  and they can't afford to pay firefighters [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1389.3s)]
*  knowing that wildfires like you're watching [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1391.4199999999998s)]
*  on your screen are common. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1393.98s)]

*  prioritizing her department's time funding for DEI, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1398.8999999999999s)]
*  the water management and infrastructure [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1403.22s)]
*  in Southern California is also a huge problem. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1405.5s)]
*  Firefighters all across the city [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1408.94s)]
*  encountering malfunctioning hydrants [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1411.02s)]
*  as part of the city is completely, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1413.26s)]
*  now they've ran out of water. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1415.94s)]
*  And get this, because of the state's [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1417.94s)]
*  insane environmental regulations, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1420.1000000000001s)]
*  their capitulation to the environmental movement, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1422.5s)]
*  well, it's designed to protect a rare, what, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1425.38s)]
*  fish species, billions of gallons of water, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  literally are dumped into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1431.82s)]
*  Instead of being stored in reservoirs [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1435.1399999999999s)]
*  for emergencies like this. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1437.6999999999998s)]
*  And several months ago before the election, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1439.74s)]
*  Donald Trump, well, he predicted, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1441.6599999999999s)]
*  it's about four months ago, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1444.06s)]

*  Take a look. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1448.4199999999998s)]
*  They said, we have no water. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1449.86s)]
*  I said, do you have a drought? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1451.8999999999999s)]
*  No, we don't have a drought. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1452.98s)]
*  I said, why don't you have no water? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1455.62s)]
*  It's got a natural flow from Canada [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1458.54s)]
*  all the way up north, more water than they could ever use. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1460.1799999999998s)]
*  And in order to protect a tiny little fish, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1464.1s)]
*  the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1468.1799999999998s)]
*  Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1472.58s)]
*  You know, your forests are dry as a bone, okay? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1475.86s)]
*  Dangerous. That water could be routed. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1478.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, you could have everything, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1480.3s)]
*  not only dangerous, billions of dollars a year [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1482.1s)]
*  they spend on forest fires. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1484.74s)]
*  Now, this was not Donald Trump's only warning to California [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1488.06s)]
*  back in 2018 during his first term [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1490.8999999999999s)]
*  with Governor Newsom standing right beside him. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1493.58s)]
*  Well, President Trump urged the state of California [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1496.26s)]
*  to manage their forests and cut back the brush. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1500.02s)]
*  Common sense, the science of forestry. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1503.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1506.02s)]
*  We get all of this cleaned out and protected. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1507.4199999999998s)]
*  We gotta take care of the floors. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1511.06s)]
*  You know, the floors of the forest, very important. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1512.46s)]
*  You look at other countries where they do it differently, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1516.1s)]
*  and it's a whole different story. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1519.3s)]
*  I was with the president of Finland, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1522.3s)]

*  we're a forest nation. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1526.74s)]
*  He called it a forest nation. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1527.74s)]
*  And they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1529.82s)]
*  and doing things, and they don't have any problem. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1532.82s)]
*  And when it is, it's a very small problem. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1535.94s)]
*  So I know everybody's looking at that to that end. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1538.54s)]
*  Now, sadly, Donald Trump's warnings fell on deaf ears, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1544.26s)]
*  and now the people of California, they are suffering, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1546.98s)]
*  but this was a disaster that had been brewing [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1549.54s)]
*  for many decades, and you can go to school. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1552.26s)]
*  You can get a degree in forestry. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1555.26s)]
*  This is not complicated science. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1558.1s)]
*  In deep blue California, one party, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1560.06s)]
*  they have all the power. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1562.42s)]
*  There's no oversight, there's no accountability. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1563.7s)]
*  They have been catering to the radical environmentalists [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1566.3799999999999s)]
*  over people's safety for decades. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1569.26s)]
*  You know, they can have limited control burns. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1572.18s)]
*  They can have brush removal, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1574.94s)]
*  which is the kindling for these fires. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1577.54s)]
*  Just like when they denied, you might recall, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1579.94s)]
*  we were in the San Joaquin Valley, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1582.54s)]
*  and they were denying literally, you know, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1584.66s)]
*  thousands and thousands of acres of farmland water. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1587.98s)]
*  Farmers were not allowed to farm [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1591.54s)]
*  in favor of a little minnow fish called the Delta smelt. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1593.98s)]
*  We went out there and covered that story. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1597.66s)]
*  Not even, it's not even an endangered species, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1600.34s)]
*  but they gave the water to the Delta smelt, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1604.26s)]
*  not to the farmers. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1606.38s)]
*  You know, there are no reality checks [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1607.94s)]
*  in California's one-party rule. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1609.8600000000001s)]
*  Listen to Adam Carolla, detail, his experience [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1612.0200000000002s)]
*  as a young man when he tried to apply [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1614.8600000000001s)]
*  to the LA Fire Department. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1616.9s)]
*  Listen to this story. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1618.2600000000002s)]
*  I could not find a job. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1620.22s)]
*  I walked to a fire station in North Hollywood. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1621.66s)]
*  I was 19, I was living in the garage of my family home. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1624.18s)]
*  My mom was on welfare and food stamps, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1627.8200000000002s)]
*  and I said, can I get a job as a fireman? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1629.7800000000002s)]
*  And they said, no, because you're not black, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1632.46s)]
*  Hispanic or a woman. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1635.02s)]
*  We'll see in about seven years. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1637.1s)]
*  And I went to a construction site and dug ditches [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1639.02s)]
*  and picked up garbage for the next seven years. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1641.78s)]
*  I got a letter in the mail sent to my father's house [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1644.42s)]
*  saying, your time has come to do the written exam [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1647.66s)]
*  for the LA Fire Department. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1650.66s)]
*  I took it and I was standing in line [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1652.82s)]
*  and I had a young woman of color standing behind me in line. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1655.42s)]
*  And I said, just out of curiosity, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1658.02s)]
*  when did you sign up to become a fireman? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1659.58s)]
*  Because I did it or a person. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1662.46s)]
*  And she said, seven years ago. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1665.3000000000002s)]
*  And she said, Wednesday. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1667.14s)]
*  Now in the near future, when the fire has been contained, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1670.3000000000002s)]
*  there's gotta be a reckoning in all of California, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1673.5800000000002s)]
*  not just Southern California. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1676.46s)]
*  But for now, we do pray for everyone impacted [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1678.5400000000002s)]
*  by the devastating fires still raging all across the city. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzawDYrbgc&t=1681.42s)]
