**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk)
*  No one died except for terrorists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=0.0s)]
*  There was no collateral damage. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2.34s)]
*  The mission was a success. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=4.14s)]
*  And Democrats think they have a scandal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=5.94s)]
*  Accidentally adding someone to a group text, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=8.14s)]
*  which we've all done, is the New Watergate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=10.88s)]
*  The National Security Advisor, Mike Walz, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=13.82s)]
*  his staff accidentally added an American reporter [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=16.32s)]
*  to a group text of Trump officials [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=19.26s)]
*  who were discussing an attack on Iranian proxies. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=21.26s)]
*  And the reporter accidentally added to the group text? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Wasn't a good guy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=27.76s)]
*  Wasn't like our very own stupid son of a bitch, Peter Ducey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=29.5s)]
*  It happened, no, the guy's a total sleazebag. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=33.6s)]
*  The Atlantic, the Atlantic is a failed magazine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Does very, very poorly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=39.84s)]
*  Nobody gives a damn about it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=41.0s)]
*  It gives, this gives it a little bit of a shot. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=42.64s)]
*  And I will tell you this, that they've made up more stories [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=46.14s)]
*  and they're just a failing magazine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=50.32s)]
*  The public understands that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=52.96s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg got the scoop of his life by accident [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  because somebody may have fat fingered him [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=58.04s)]
*  into a private chat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  He says on the group text, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=61.48s)]
*  Hegseth shared war plans for the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=63.12s)]
*  Pete says, no, I didn't. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=66.32s)]
*  Classified material never entered the chat. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=67.86s)]
*  So it's a he said, she said. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=70.7s)]
*  Goldberg's the she. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=73.0s)]
*  Yay, read some things he probably shouldn't have. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  It was an accident. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=76.9s)]
*  Accidents happen when you're taking action. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=78.06s)]
*  If you sleep all day like Biden and take no action, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  well, that's a dereliction of duty. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=83.5s)]
*  Mike Waltz says he has no idea [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  how this dishonest reporter even got access to the chat. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=88.1s)]
*  This one in particular, I've never met, don't know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  never communicated with. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=95.1s)]
*  And we are looking into and reviewing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=96.3s)]
*  how the heck he got into this room. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=101.64s)]
*  the world owes President Trump a favor. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  President Trump took decisive action [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  with his national security team, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=107.84s)]
*  took out the head missileer, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  knocked out missiles, knocked out headquarters, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=112.08s)]
*  knocked out communication sites. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=114.33999999999999s)]
*  And for once, as we hear, as you all hear [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=116.77999999999999s)]
*  from every one of our allies, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  thank God for American leadership again. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=121.77999999999999s)]
*  Thank God for American strength. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=124.16s)]
*  You're welcome, Waltz. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=126.32s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=128.12s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=129.32s)]
*  Later with Laura, Waltz says he may have been catfished. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=135.4s)]
*  and then you have somebody else's number there? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=137.76s)]
*  Oh, I never make those mistakes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=140.14s)]
*  You've got somebody else's number [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=141.82000000000002s)]
*  on someone else's contact. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  So of course I didn't see this loser in the group. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=145.56s)]
*  It looked like someone else. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  Now, whether he did it deliberately [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=149.46s)]
*  or it happened in some other technical mean [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  is something we're trying to figure out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=153.8s)]
*  Journalists like Goldberg will sometimes send out fake names [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Waltz says Elon and Big Balls are on the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=162.4s)]
*  This wouldn't surprise me if Goldberg sneaked his way in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=165.24s)]
*  He's the lowest of the low. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  This is the guy who reported that Trump [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=169.72000000000003s)]
*  didn't want to pay for a Gold Star funeral. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  Remember he said it doesn't cost 60K [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=173.78s)]
*  to bury an effing Mexican. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=175.74s)]
*  Total lie. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Goldberg's the guy who said that Trump called [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=179.12s)]
*  American soldiers suckers and losers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=181.02s)]
*  Lie. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=183.46s)]
*  These guys find people, P-tape, can't trust them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Goldberg held this bombshell for a week [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=188.46s)]
*  and then dropped it the night before [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=191.86s)]
*  half the group chat was set up to testify on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  They testified and said, yeah, we used Signal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Biden gave it to us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=200.46s)]
*  One of the first things that happened [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=202.54s)]
*  when I was confirmed as CIA director [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=204.02s)]
*  was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=206.76s)]
*  as it is for most CIA officers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=210.42s)]
*  One of the things that I was briefed on very early, Senator, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  was by the CIA records management folks [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=217.46s)]
*  about the use of Signal as a permissible work use. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=220.7s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=225.16s)]
*  That is a practice that preceded the current administration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=226.18s)]
*  to the Biden administration. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=229.78s)]
*  You think the CIA had anything to do with this? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=232.44s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=235.4s)]
*  But Biden staffers were on Signal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=236.68s)]
*  Every Democrat in DC uses Signal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=239.12s)]
*  Here's Jasmine not to be confused [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=242.04s)]
*  with Davy Crockett on Saturday. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=244.04s)]
*  We have all these Signal chats. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=246.6s)]
*  If you don't have Signal, get on Signal, okay? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=247.96s)]
*  Do not trust that, get on Signal, y'all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=250.32s)]
*  Democrats use Signal to deal with Christopher Steele, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=253.48s)]
*  Mr. Dossier. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=256.44s)]
*  Trump's team uses it to take out terrorists. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=257.68s)]
*  And now that's worse than the Pentagon Papers? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=260.54s)]
*  It's stunning. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  It's likely the biggest national security debacle [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=266.02s)]
*  that any professional can remember. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  This kind of planning for a military operation [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=272.42s)]
*  should be done very carefully and very deliberately, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=276.38s)]
*  not on a Signal chat, not with emojis, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=279.1s)]
*  for the Trump people to be saying, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=281.74s)]
*  this chat shows how seriously [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=283.5s)]
*  they take the decision-making process, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=285.56s)]
*  which makes me laugh out loud. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  We would never get on a Signal chat. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=289.12s)]
*  Four Americans were killed in Benghazi, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=291.56s)]
*  and Susan Rice said it wasn't terrorism. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=293.44s)]
*  She blamed a YouTube video for a protest [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=295.68s)]
*  that got out of hand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=297.98s)]
*  The happiest guy in DC today, Schumer. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=299.68s)]
*  Finally, something took the heat off him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=302.72s)]
*  I am calling for a bipartisan investigation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=305.76s)]
*  in the Senate of this mishandling. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=308.68s)]
*  Any Senate Republican who was up in arms years ago [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=310.88s)]
*  about emails and unsecured servers [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=314.12s)]
*  should be outraged by the Secretary of Defense's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=317.14s)]
*  carelessness. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  Hillary homebrewed a server in her basement [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=321.24s)]

*  were hanging out chatting on signal instead, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=707.14s)]
*  that is very noteworthy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=710.6s)]
*  That's gonna raise a lot of red flags. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=712.08s)]
*  All this information about a strike that happened [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=713.96s)]
*  was imminent. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=719.68s)]
*  I think about all the different ways [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=720.64s)]
*  that people's lives were in danger. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=722.92s)]
*  This is so utterly ridiculous. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=724.76s)]
*  It's not only a national embarrassment, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  this is a national emergency. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=728.28s)]
*  It's stunning. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=729.96s)]
*  It's likely the biggest national security debacle [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=731.7s)]
*  that any professional can remember. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=735.04s)]
*  Oh, breathless hysteria from even Humpty Dumpty [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=739.04s)]
*  made a return appearance and liberal Joe, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=741.68s)]
*  predictably, as you can see, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=744.16s)]
*  the state-run legacy media mob, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=746.4s)]
*  they're all worked up. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=748.1s)]
*  But here are the facts that they're not gonna tell you. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=749.38s)]
*  First, according to the Director for National Intelligence, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  no classified information was shared in this group exchange. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=755.72s)]
*  Two, signal, the encrypted messaging app [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=759.38s)]
*  used for the conversation is approved for government use. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=762.1s)]
*  It was actually even preloaded [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=765.64s)]
*  onto our CIA director's government phone. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=767.38s)]
*  Three, perhaps most importantly, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=770.26s)]
*  something they'll never think about, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=772.62s)]
*  the military mission, thankfully, was a complete success. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=774.48s)]
*  Now, of course, it's not acceptable [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=777.9s)]
*  for a reporter from the Atlantic [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=779.74s)]
*  to be accidentally included [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=781.38s)]
*  in a group policy discussion at the White House, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  but this was a one-off. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=786.22s)]
*  This was an accident, not a nationwide crisis. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=788.26s)]
*  On ex-retired Green Beret military planner, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=791.62s)]
*  Congressman Keith Self, described it this way, quote, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=794.26s)]
*  fast-moving coordination immediately prior to any operation [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=797.74s)]
*  is absolutely necessary. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=801.4599999999999s)]
*  This was a successful, precision military operation [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  period. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=807.74s)]
*  This incident carried no adverse consequences at all. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=808.74s)]
*  The deceptive story makes a mountain out of a molehill. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=812.2s)]
*  Good characterization. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=815.14s)]
*  The Congressman is right, and I'll take it a step further. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=816.78s)]
*  Let me let you all in on a little secret. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=819.38s)]
*  What is an undeniable truth of life? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=823.08s)]
*  Most Democrats, most members of that state-run [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=825.54s)]
*  corrupt legacy media mob that are dead [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=828.9s)]
*  and that have no influence, just don't know it yet, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=832.02s)]
*  they don't actually care about this story. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=835.14s)]
*  Pay attention, per usual. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=838.98s)]
*  It is simply more feign, phony, moral outrage. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, how do I know that I'm correct? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=845.3s)]
*  How do we know that this is not real? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=847.66s)]
*  Well, in case you forgot, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=850.74s)]
*  national security was not a top priority of concern [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=852.34s)]
*  for Democrats or the media in the past few years. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=856.0s)]
*  In fact, they had no problem when Joe Biden [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=860.18s)]
*  created the single biggest preventable [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=862.76s)]
*  national security crisis ever in our history [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=865.24s)]
*  when he opened the floodgates at our southern border, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=868.98s)]
*  letting in known terrorists, criminals, murderers, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  rapists, gang members, cartel members, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=875.48s)]
*  and millions of other unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=878.08s)]
*  The very same people now are pretending [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=881.04s)]
*  that they care about national security breaches. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=884.28s)]
*  They were the exact same partisans that flat out [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=886.98s)]
*  lied day in and day out for four years, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=890.56s)]
*  and they told all of you that the border was secure [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=893.88s)]
*  and the border was closed. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  They also lied about Biden's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=899.0s)]
*  Now, a president's cognitive decline, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=902.48s)]
*  that would be a clear and present danger [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=905.26s)]
*  to our national security, but the radical left, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=907.62s)]
*  these very same people that are so outraged today, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=911.06s)]
*  they did not care, and they lied, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=914.26s)]
*  and they all covered it up. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=916.6s)]
*  They all knew. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=917.96s)]
*  In fact, DOJ Special Counsel Robert Herr [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=918.9s)]
*  determined that Biden was so out of it, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=921.9399999999999s)]
*  was handing out state secrets like candy [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=924.56s)]
*  to his ghostwriter for an upcoming autobiography. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=927.14s)]
*  Did any of these hyperventilating Democrats, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=931.34s)]
*  media people, did they care at that moment [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=934.26s)]
*  when it really mattered, day in and day out, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=937.38s)]
*  when they were all lying about it? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=940.14s)]
*  This was systemic institutional lying [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=941.86s)]
*  that they went along with. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=944.9s)]
*  That means they don't really care [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=946.46s)]
*  about what happened in this particular case. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=948.3399999999999s)]
*  They are feigning outrage. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  And remember, Herr didn't charge the former president [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=952.4599999999999s)]
*  with a crime because Joey was an elderly man [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=955.28s)]
*  that had a very poor memory and would be unfit for trial. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  Democrats, the media mob, they didn't care. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=962.26s)]
*  They attacked Herr, they defended Biden. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=964.66s)]
*  They were also unconcerned with Biden's disastrous withdrawal [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=966.88s)]
*  from Afghanistan. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=970.3399999999999s)]
*  That resulted in the horrific deaths [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=972.02s)]
*  of 13 innocent US service members. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=974.02s)]
*  They also caused a flood of unvetted refugees [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=976.62s)]
*  out of Afghanistan. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=980.26s)]
*  And don't forget the billions and billions of dollars [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=981.82s)]
*  worth of very sophisticated US military equipment [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=984.38s)]
*  that was left behind for the Taliban, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=988.26s)]
*  the very same group that helped facilitate 911-01. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=990.24s)]
*  And to add insult to injury, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=993.42s)]
*  Biden also abandoned Bagram Air Base, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=995.1s)]
*  which is now vulnerable to neighboring China, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=998.14s)]
*  well, filling the gap. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1001.42s)]
*  And speaking of China, you might recall General Milley [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1003.22s)]
*  in 2021, the now disgraced former chairman [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1006.26s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs was accused of sharing US intel [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1009.38s)]
*  with China, even reportedly promised his Chinese counterpart [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1012.78s)]
*  a heads up if the United States planned to launch an attack, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1016.78s)]
*  quote, if we're going to attack, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1020.5s)]
*  I'm going to call you ahead of time. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1022.72s)]
*  It's not going to be a surprise. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1024.74s)]
*  Wow, eliminating the element of surprise if we needed it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1026.98s)]
*  Not a good idea. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1030.26s)]
*  According to a report in the Washington Post, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1031.48s)]
*  he also attempted to assert the president's nuclear authority. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1034.2199999999998s)]
*  This is when President Trump was in office. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1037.6999999999998s)]
*  This was a huge scandal. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1039.6999999999998s)]
*  But once again, the state-run legacy media mob, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1041.74s)]
*  the Democratic Party, they did not hoot, they did not howl, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1044.62s)]
*  they did not feign moral outrage, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1047.8999999999999s)]
*  they did not bang on desks, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1049.78s)]
*  they did not talk about national security. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1051.1399999999999s)]
*  They just didn't care when he even demanded [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1053.48s)]
*  that any nuclear launch go through him. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1057.2199999999998s)]
*  No wonder he needed a preemptive pardon. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1060.4599999999998s)]
*  So now, the outrage from the left over a reporter [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1062.78s)]
*  accidentally being added a one-off, one-time, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1066.62s)]
*  minor accident that did not impact the operation [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1070.94s)]
*  to a White House group chat about a successful strike [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1074.42s)]
*  on Yemen is just a political show. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1077.1s)]
*  That is the story behind the story. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1081.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1084.02s)]
*  To distract the country from their incessant, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1084.86s)]
*  incessant, petulant performance art [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1088.46s)]
*  they're infighting, they're bingo cards. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1091.86s)]
*  They wanna smear Donald Trump and the White House [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1094.3s)]
*  any way they can. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1097.3799999999999s)]
*  They want any political scalp they can get, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1098.4799999999998s)]
*  but President Trump is not having it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  He's not putting up with this crap. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1102.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1103.9399999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, are you gonna change any of the practices [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1105.62s)]
*  that your national security officials used [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1107.9199999999998s)]
*  after a reporter was inadvertently added [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1110.1799999999998s)]
*  to a group chat about attacks on Yemen? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1112.3s)]
*  Well, I think it's a question I've been asked now [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1115.82s)]
*  and I've given it a few answers [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1119.62s)]
*  and they've all been the same. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  We have an amazing group. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1123.48s)]
*  Our national security now is stronger than it's ever been. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1124.8400000000001s)]
*  We have had a very, very successful, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1128.48s)]
*  numerous attacks on that area. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1131.44s)]
*  These are people that shoot down ships, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1133.72s)]
*  not only our ships, ships all over the world. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1135.8200000000002s)]
*  They're shooting down right out of the water [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  and damaging them badly or they're going down. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1140.24s)]
*  They're also shooting anything that happens [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1142.78s)]
*  to be flying in the area. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1144.54s)]
*  We hit them very, very hard. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1146.26s)]
*  There was no classified information, as I understand it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1148.68s)]
*  They used a app, if you wanna call it an app, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1152.64s)]
*  that a lot of people use, a lot of people in government use, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1158.0s)]
*  a lot of people in the media use. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1160.52s)]
*  Now, thanks to the president, over the past decade, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1163.0s)]
*  Republicans have learned a valuable lesson. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1165.2s)]
*  Never give an inch to the radical mob [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1167.2s)]
*  and they will fail as this latest political attack will fail [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1169.76s)]
*  and it is political in nature. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1173.76s)]
*  Eventually, the hysteria will burn out on its own. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1175.16s)]
*  They will move on to the next baseless smear, slander. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1178.14s)]
*  And after so much apocalyptic rhetoric, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1181.26s)]
*  the American people have lost interest. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1185.18s)]
*  They should have learned that after the results in November. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1187.6200000000001s)]
*  Now the Democratic party is polling worse than ever. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1190.5s)]
*  They're doing great in the 20s. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1193.0800000000002s)]
*  Keep going, guys. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1194.42s)]
*  All while Donald Trump continues to poll at record highs, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1195.6200000000001s)]
*  which we will get into later. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1198.66s)]
*  ["The Big Bang"] [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1200.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1219.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1223.26s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1224.7s)]
*  Now I know how Gandhi felt. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1227.94s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1231.14s)]
*  So regarding the signal chat snafu [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1232.9s)]
*  where Trump officials included a journalist in a group text, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1235.22s)]
*  the White House says no classified information [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1238.52s)]
*  was involved. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1240.8600000000001s)]
*  There's still no word if they'll return to Joe Biden's [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1242.26s)]
*  preferred form of communication. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1244.5s)]
*  Hillary Clinton weighed in on the signal story saying, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1252.3s)]
*  you gotta be kidding me. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1255.26s)]
*  Then she offered Pete Hegseth her hammer [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1257.3400000000001s)]
*  to smash his phone. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1259.06s)]
*  The Nevada legislature is considering a bill [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1263.1399999999999s)]
*  that would allow home delivery for cocktails. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1265.5s)]
*  Yeah, and a related story, guess who just moved to Nevada? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1269.02s)]
*  The New York Times finally admits [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1280.34s)]
*  that all those plastic bags may not have been [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1281.8799999999999s)]
*  as environmentally bad as activists claimed. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1284.74s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1288.54s)]
*  Look what this plastic bag did to California. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1289.7s)]
*  It's perfect, isn't it? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1299.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1301.42s)]
*  At an awards dinner, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1302.86s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett referred to Texas governor Greg Abbott, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1303.94s)]
*  who uses a wheelchair as governor hot wheels. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1307.18s)]
*  I know, which is almost as offensive as her own nickname, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1312.66s)]
*  Cabbage Patch Bitch. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1316.5s)]
*  You think that's bad? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1319.3s)]
*  When she was younger, she was called Strawberry Short Bus. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1321.74s)]
*  We had some worse ones, you know. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1328.78s)]
*  Doe's just discovered that the Small Business Association [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1330.42s)]
*  gave a nine month old baby a $100,000 loan. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1333.54s)]
*  I know, now the kid's so worried he won't make payments, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1338.98s)]
*  he's shitting his pants. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1341.34s)]
*  World athletics will approve cheek swabs [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1348.86s)]
*  to determine if an athlete is a woman, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1353.3s)]
*  sparing the women the far more embarrassing math test. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1357.06s)]
*  Oh, sexist will say. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1361.26s)]
*  Oh, you know it's true. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1365.1s)]
*  And finally, Rosie O'Donnell apologized [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1370.7s)]
*  to Ireland's prime minister [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1373.02s)]
*  for overshadowing his visit to the White House. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1375.06s)]
*  She also apologized for overshadowing [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1378.26s)]
*  the Western hemisphere. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1380.9s)]
*  That's a fat joke. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1385.46s)]
*  So it looks like the postal service [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1387.62s)]
*  is cutting 50 million work hours per year, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1389.42s)]
*  which will no doubt delay that birthday card [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1393.02s)]
*  I get from my dentist. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1395.3s)]
*  But it's occurred to me that the postman [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1398.54s)]
*  is like a reverse garbage man. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1400.22s)]
*  Instead of picking up trash from your house, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1402.3s)]
*  he leaves it there. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1404.14s)]
*  And expects a tip around Christmas. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1406.34s)]
*  Yeah, like he's the guy who shaves my back. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1408.5s)]
*  But every damn day, 95% of the mail I get is junk, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1412.1399999999999s)]
*  and I bet it's the same for you. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1415.86s)]
*  Pizza coupons, flyers for local politicians, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1417.62s)]
*  catalogs for crap I'll never buy. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1420.62s)]
*  My neighbor's W2. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1423.86s)]
*  Mountains of garbage just destined for the nearest landfill. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1427.26s)]
*  They should just drive by and throw it on our lawn. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1430.74s)]
*  Just like Taylor Swift did with my bodybuilding trophies. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1434.06s)]
*  Cause it's just crap that you have to throw away. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1439.66s)]
*  Talk about pointless make work. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1442.7s)]
*  Two separate government positions, mailman and garbage man, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1444.58s)]
*  are getting paid to make you work for free. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1447.86s)]
*  You're just the middle man moving one bag of trash [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  to the other. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1452.74s)]
*  It's like trying to stay on top of the fast food wrappers [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1453.78s)]
*  at The View. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1456.1399999999999s)]
*  Of course, if somebody needs to mail you [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1460.3s)]
*  something important, you're probably gonna get it [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1461.82s)]
*  via FedEx, UPS or Amazon, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1463.86s)]
*  unless of course it's a pipe bomb from your ex. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1465.74s)]
*  They do it the old fashioned way. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1467.82s)]
*  And email has pretty much replaced most snail mail. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1469.82s)]
*  So what's left? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1472.7s)]
*  Notices for jury duty? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1473.86s)]
*  Magazines? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1475.66s)]
*  Do people still read those? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1476.78s)]
*  I still have a stack of National Geographic's, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1478.82s)]
*  you know, in case the internet goes down. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1481.46s)]
*  Birthday cards from grandma, okay, I admit it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1486.62s)]
*  Who doesn't love getting a check for $5? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1488.86s)]
*  But I don't even get any mail at work anymore, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1491.26s)]
*  except the occasional invite to go skinny dipping from Kudlow. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1494.06s)]
*  So let's be honest, the postal service is a lot like Joy Reid. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1500.54s)]
*  If it disappeared overnight, no one would miss it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1504.54s)]
*  I hate saying that because I grew up loving our mailman. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1513.46s)]
*  I remember him clearly, a lean gray haired man, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1517.34s)]
*  a gray haired man in shorts and high socks. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1520.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1523.46s)]
*  No, wait, that was Ellen DeGeneres. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1524.5s)]
*  But times have changed. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1529.26s)]
*  The mailman is a relic of a simpler time, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1530.7s)]
*  like a TV repair man, the milkman or the peeping Tom. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1533.7s)]
*  Remember those? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1538.54s)]
*  But it's 2025 and now we just sit at a kitchen table [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1540.46s)]
*  with a stack of crap staring back at us. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1544.3s)]
*  Worse, how many important things did you miss [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1547.46s)]
*  because they were buried in that stack of crap? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1549.82s)]
*  Like that signed 8x10 photo I received [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1553.06s)]
*  from a shirtless Brit Hume. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1555.62s)]
*  But that's not the only thing lost. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1561.46s)]
*  Last year, the postal service lost $9.5 billion. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1563.34s)]
*  No wonder Trump calls the postal service [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1567.46s)]
*  a tremendous loser for this country. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1569.34s)]
*  He promised to cut government waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1571.82s)]
*  I mean, think how many post offices [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1574.82s)]
*  could be turned into something more productive. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1576.74s)]
*  You know, like blockbusters. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1579.3s)]
*  Initially, the postmaster general welcomed Doge [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1583.34s)]
*  to help make the postal service more efficient. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1585.58s)]
*  But then over the weekend, postal workers [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1587.8999999999999s)]
*  helped save the USPS rallies across the country. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1589.54s)]
*  I bet they used email and not snail mail to get the word out. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1593.1s)]
*  Now the postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1596.98s)]
*  America's top mailman, has resigned. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1600.22s)]
*  Trump received his resignation letter in the mail [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1603.34s)]
*  along with a car wash and a dry cleaning coupon book. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1605.5s)]
*  This is Wells Fargo has drawn up plans [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1609.3s)]
*  to privatize the postal service. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1611.74s)]
*  Now there's a word that'll make Dems shudder. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1614.3799999999999s)]
*  Privatize. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1616.82s)]
*  Yeah, why have a private business make money [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1618.5s)]
*  and provide good service at a reasonable price [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1620.7s)]
*  when the government can do none of those things? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1622.82s)]
*  But all the signs point to a conclusion. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1625.6599999999999s)]
*  The post office is a luxury we can no longer afford, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1628.3799999999999s)]
*  especially when the luxury, stuff delivered to your house, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1631.54s)]
*  has become an annoying burden. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1634.82s)]
*  Life is complicated and when something [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1637.26s)]
*  that is meant to simplify it [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1638.66s)]
*  ends up adding to your nightly list of worries, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1640.22s)]
*  like, should I keep this coupon for Brazilian butt lifts [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1642.5s)]
*  or throw it out? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1645.98s)]
*  Then you know it's run its course. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1647.3s)]
*  We kept the postal service around [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1650.6200000000001s)]
*  because it seemed to be a given. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1652.18s)]
*  But now it just delivers meaningless stuff [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1654.5s)]
*  and charges us for it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1656.46s)]
*  I guess it's a lot like the stuff [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  that we see government doing to us instead of for us. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1659.94s)]
*  And I'm just sick and tired of the fact [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1663.8600000000001s)]
*  and I'm just sick and tired of taking their crap. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1666.1399999999999s)]

*  Aaron, I think it's really weird that we have come [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1725.62s)]
*  to just accept the idea of coming home from work, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1729.06s)]
*  putting your hand in there and grabbing a bunch of crap, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1732.74s)]
*  taking a bunch of crap from outside [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1735.5s)]
*  and bringing it inside, putting it on a table, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1737.5s)]
*  and then deciding, oh, I guess I should go through that crap. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1740.1s)]
*  And then you go through that crap [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1743.34s)]
*  and then you walk over and you throw it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1744.54s)]
*  It makes no sense to me. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1746.02s)]
*  It wasn't always like this. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1747.34s)]
*  It wasn't, but also leave it to Democrats [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1749.34s)]
*  to defend having to spend taxpayer money on that crap. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1751.7s)]
*  It loses billions of dollars. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1756.26s)]
*  And they're like, no, no, no, I get it. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1758.6200000000001s)]
*  If that was my job, if I worked at the postal service [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1760.46s)]

*  This is what we need to talk about. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1768.5400000000002s)]
*  If this was any business, it would have folded. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1770.26s)]
*  But because it's the government, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1772.5800000000002s)]
*  it has a backstop that ultimately exists. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1773.8200000000002s)]
*  And if we wanna look at what the waste is at USPS, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1776.3400000000001s)]
*  in the NPR article that was in some of the prep work [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1780.1s)]
*  about this, at the very bottom was a disclaimer [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1782.78s)]
*  that says the USPS is a financial supporter of NPR. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1785.22s)]
*  If somebody can explain to me why the postal service [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1789.3799999999999s)]
*  is giving monetary support to NPR, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1792.78s)]
*  I would love to know why that's a good use of money. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1795.86s)]
*  Mm, you know why? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1799.22s)]
*  It's because NPR gives away those tote bags [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1800.62s)]
*  and the tote bags are perfect [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1807.6599999999999s)]
*  for putting all your trashy mail in it [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1808.82s)]
*  when you're carrying it outside. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1811.02s)]
*  You know, Jim, you're one of the few people [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  that really needs the mail. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1813.54s)]
*  I mean, that's how you get your naturist magazines [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1814.98s)]
*  and your overseas cheap medications. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1818.26s)]
*  Yes, and I'm a big fan of highlights, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1820.34s)]
*  Goofus and Gallant, if you remember. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1822.02s)]
*  Who did you identify with? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1824.1399999999999s)]
*  A little bit of both, actually, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1825.5s)]
*  and I would say that to people at parties. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1826.74s)]
*  You know, I'm a little Goofus and a little Gallant [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1828.7s)]
*  and then they would walk away from me. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1830.54s)]
*  You know, one thing you forgot, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1833.58s)]
*  it was a great piece on the postal office, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1834.78s)]
*  is that the employees, you know, a lot of them, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1837.42s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of them are great. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1840.46s)]
*  You have to say that first. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1842.26s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are really nice guys. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1843.54s)]
*  But they're atrocious because I go into the one [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1845.98s)]
*  in my neighborhood, they never have the labels you need, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1850.22s)]
*  it's always empty, it's inefficient, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1852.8200000000002s)]
*  and there's a guy at this one post office, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1855.02s)]
*  like I haven't seen him in a year, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1857.18s)]
*  and this is not probably a day that goes by [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1858.66s)]
*  that I don't fantasize about his car going off a cliff. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1860.94s)]
*  It's just the worst lump with a mask, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1864.02s)]
*  and he tells me to fill out the form, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1868.38s)]
*  and we fill out the form and it's the wrong form, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1869.9s)]
*  and he won't let me get back in line real quick. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1871.6200000000001s)]
*  So they're unfirable, and if you ever see it, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1873.78s)]
*  they're miserable, and that's a big part of it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1876.7s)]
*  In a privatized thing, you know you're fireable, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1879.3400000000001s)]
*  so you're more likely to do your job and be efficient. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1881.74s)]
*  I spend more at FedEx than at the post office, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1883.78s)]
*  just to avoid dealing with that lump, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1886.0600000000002s)]
*  and you know who you are, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1888.6200000000001s)]
*  and I hope you can't watch this because you died. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1890.98s)]
*  I love Jim because he's such an optimist. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1893.54s)]
*  Yes, I remember as a kid, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1900.54s)]
*  I thought being a mailman would be a great job. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1903.54s)]
*  I wanted to be a mailman, and then my mommy told me that, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1906.18s)]
*  no, only inmates do that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1908.9s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1910.6200000000001s)]
*  She lied to me, but it was a good lie. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1912.02s)]
*  Do you think it's a pipe dream to think [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1914.9s)]
*  that the postal service could be privatized? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1918.14s)]
*  Well, I mean, as a lover of liberty and a libertarian, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1921.26s)]
*  I think everything should be privatized, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1923.8999999999999s)]
*  and I think the post office is a great way to start, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1926.5s)]
*  and like you, I had my own postal fantasy when I was a child, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1928.86s)]
*  because my brothers told me that Mr. Potter, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1932.78s)]
*  our mailman, was my real dad. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1935.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1937.58s)]
*  So I believed that for a long time. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1938.9799999999998s)]
*  I still do, in fact. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1943.2199999999998s)]
*  My parents split up, but Mr. Potter came around [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1944.78s)]
*  for every Christmas dinner. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1947.02s)]
*  It's real weird. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1948.7399999999998s)]
*  Nice. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1949.74s)]
*  Putting it in the slot. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1950.82s)]
*  No. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1955.14s)]
*  Did I go too far? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1955.98s)]
*  No. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1956.98s)]
*  Did I go too far? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1957.82s)]
*  Hold on, you're talking about the mail, you sick bastard. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1958.66s)]
*  Yes, I wasn't talking, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1960.6200000000001s)]
*  I was not talking about the vagina. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1962.22s)]
*  You make me sick, perverted audience. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1964.78s)]
*  Where do we get these people, Tyrus? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1967.3s)]
*  You gotta start charging. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1970.34s)]
*  I know, this is what happens when it's free. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1971.26s)]
*  We need to privatize our audience. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1973.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1975.18s)]
*  All right, everybody throw up five bucks. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1977.26s)]
*  I do think that this, when I'm describing [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1979.86s)]
*  how you get the mail every night is a shared experience, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1983.9s)]
*  but we just accept it, and why do we have to, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1986.94s)]
*  do you have a system with your mail [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1990.1s)]
*  where you don't bring it inside? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1991.94s)]
*  Why do you bring trash inside, is what I'm getting at. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1993.94s)]
*  As a black man, we don't bring our mail until third notice. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1996.7s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=1999.7s)]
*  Uh. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2000.54s)]
*  If it ain't got the red letter on the front of it, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2003.38s)]
*  I ain't touching it, so. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2006.6200000000001s)]
*  That is a great rule. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2008.06s)]
*  Yeah, so until the yellow ones, let them go. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2008.8999999999999s)]
*  When it's red, oh, let me open this up. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2011.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2012.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, what cracks me up about this is we've dealt with, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2013.74s)]
*  and entertained, and a lot of us to our financial pain [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2019.62s)]
*  is the fake problems that the left, you know, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  the green, we need to do this, we need windmills, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2028.22s)]
*  we need solar, we need all this money to do this stuff. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2029.98s)]
*  Now, okay, what's the results? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2032.54s)]
*  We get more dead whales and birds. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2033.86s)]
*  Like, wait a minute, I'm not gonna do this. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2035.54s)]
*  Wait a minute, so it was worse before it started. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2037.74s)]
*  Here's an actual thing where there needs to be a correction. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2040.38s)]
*  We have emails now. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2043.0600000000002s)]
*  Everyone usually goes paperless for that same reason, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2044.18s)]
*  so you don't have to get the red notice. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2047.0200000000002s)]
*  So we don't really need the post office [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2049.62s)]
*  the way it was 50 years ago. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2051.78s)]
*  So it's a good thing to see, like, hey, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2054.46s)]
*  we're gonna streamline, we're gonna make some changes, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2056.5s)]
*  because, to your point, most people get their important [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2058.5s)]
*  stuff through FedEx, or it'd be nice to go to the mail [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2060.62s)]
*  and open the mailbox for actual letters [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2063.1400000000003s)]
*  that are pertaining the information you need, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2065.42s)]
*  and from an environmental standpoint, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2067.7000000000003s)]
*  which the left should be all over this, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2069.34s)]
*  that's a lot of trees that don't go on death row [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2071.3s)]
*  for those magazines and newspapers that we never read. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2074.1800000000003s)]
*  So again, here's a fixable problem, an easy solution, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  and the pushback is because you're gonna fix [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2081.1800000000003s)]
*  an actual problem, which hurts the one thing [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2083.2200000000003s)]
*  they care about is reelection. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2085.98s)]
*  So that's the reason why they're gonna push back [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2087.98s)]
*  and fight this, because it's a really good idea. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I guess I get more, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2091.9s)]
*  I'm angry too about all this stuff, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2094.1800000000003s)]
*  like, my driver's license got suspended [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2095.82s)]
*  because I never got my notice because it was like, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2098.2200000000003s)]
*  I just threw everything out. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2101.2200000000003s)]
*  You gotta open those red letters, man. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2102.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2103.14s)]
*  But I probably threw it away, I've thrown away taxi stuff [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2103.98s)]
*  because I just get a big clump of shit, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2107.1s)]
*  throw it in the trash, you know? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2108.86s)]
*  You know, Greg, if I could jump in, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2111.62s)]
*  I order a lot of vintage kiss posters. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2112.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2115.46s)]
*  And I do that, yeah, and I always pay extra [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2116.3s)]
*  to have people avoid the post office [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2119.7000000000003s)]
*  because they don't treat them properly. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2121.3s)]
*  They are terrible with my kiss posters. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2123.42s)]
*  And I just wanted to say that out loud. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2125.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that what happened with you in the lump? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2127.9s)]
*  You messed up a kiss poster, is that what started? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2129.3s)]
*  No, I would have beaten him to death with it [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2131.3s)]
*  if that hadn't happened. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2132.98s)]
*  Ha ha ha, Jimmy and his kiss posters. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2133.82s)]
*  He's an adult. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2137.5800000000004s)]
*  Up next, the group chat freak out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2139.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2141.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2142.6200000000003s)]
*  This is compelling analysis. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2151.3s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsxj2ZV-xk&t=2152.78s)]
