# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 24, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingram Angle from Washington Tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1.84s)]
*  We have a lot to tell you about later in the show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=4.48s)]
*  Big announcement. But first, celebrating, not denigrating, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=7.58s)]
*  that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=11.92s)]
*  Now, this is the start of week six [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  of President Trump's second term, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=17.66s)]
*  and the best way to describe the policy so far, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=19.36s)]
*  unabashedly pro-American. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=23.66s)]
*  We got one badass president now who's going to come in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=26.36s)]
*  and take care of this border. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=29.94s)]
*  The fundamental goal is we want your children and grandchildren [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  to be able to raise a family in security and comfort [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  in the country that we all love. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=39.06s)]
*  He gave us a clear directive, make America safe, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=40.52s)]
*  and that's what we're going to do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=44.6s)]
*  We're at a level, I don't think we've been at this level [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=45.86s)]
*  maybe ever as the Republican Party. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=48.7s)]
*  We're a bigger, better, stronger party than ever before. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=50.7s)]
*  More people in our party than ever before. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  But the people have given us a resounding mandate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=58.0s)]
*  for dramatic change in Washington, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=61.34s)]
*  and we are going to deliver it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=63.54s)]
*  We're going to use it, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=64.98s)]
*  and we're going to make America great again by using it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=66.38s)]
*  And he got a resounding reception at CPAC over the weekend. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=69.68s)]
*  And our friend and pollster, Mark Penn, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=74.02s)]
*  he released a big survey today showing that by a 58-42 margin, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=76.26s)]
*  voters believe Trump is doing a better job than Biden. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=81.22s)]
*  Now, overall, Trump's job approval is at 52, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=85.06s)]
*  but his two major domestic policies, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=87.74s)]
*  the border and cutting waste, are extremely popular. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  Ditto for Trump's emphasis on merit over DEI and hiring. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=94.28s)]
*  But what's the Democrats' agenda? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=99.08s)]
*  Well, resisting and repeating their same old tired lines. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=101.06s)]
*  He's modeling everything upon this autocratic, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  authoritarian, dictatorial, king-like presence [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=107.22s)]
*  that he wants to play inside of our government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=112.06s)]
*  There's been one through line with Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  It has been his willingness to do Vladimir Putin's bidding. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=118.28s)]
*  He's going after critical jobs to save pennies [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=121.64s)]
*  in order to give himself more room to give big tax cuts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=124.18s)]
*  to the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest corporations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  So that's what they got. That's it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what they got. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=130.78s)]
*  I haven't heard any of that stuff before. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=132.22s)]
*  Now, while a majority of voters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=135.22s)]
*  don't agree with Trump on every policy, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=136.82s)]
*  what's key is that they do feel much more optimistic [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=139.3s)]
*  about America and the economy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  It was in the low 30s, remember, for years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  And while Congress remains underwater, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=148.36s)]
*  the Democrats are in real trouble. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=150.06s)]
*  I think you're seeing a retrospective assessment [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  of Biden and the direction the Democratic Party was going. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=156.1s)]
*  It really a lot more negative than it was on election day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=159.94s)]
*  And they're looking at the contrast on immigration, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=163.38s)]
*  on economic policy, on some of the social policies. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=165.94s)]
*  And boy, they're reevaluating. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=170.26s)]
*  And the Democratic Party, I have never seen anything like this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  This is a record low for the Democratic Party [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=174.84s)]
*  in terms of favorability. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  It has fallen really, really way down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=179.82s)]
*  And I don't think there's any leadership right now [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=182.56s)]
*  that's going to be able to bring that back. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=184.56s)]
*  Now, how do you resurrect your party, though, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=186.62s)]
*  by protecting red tape and the bureaucracy, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=188.66s)]
*  by trying to gin up sympathy for federal workers [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=191.76s)]
*  who need to get real jobs in the real world, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=194.74s)]
*  like most of America? Ever heard of it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=196.66s)]
*  Now, do Democrats really think that Americans [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  will stop liking Trump [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=201.6s)]
*  because he fires these people? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  I felt absolutely infuriated getting this email [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=205.88s)]
*  with a demand within 48 hours to provide a response [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=210.5s)]
*  on what I did within the last week or face termination. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=213.94s)]
*  This is clearly an attempt from Elon Musk [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=219.68s)]
*  to harass and bully and intimidate the federal workforce, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  which is part of his broader plan [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=227.32s)]
*  to gut the federal workforce [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  and privatize public sector services. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=231.62s)]
*  Now, making a list of what you accomplished in a week, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=235.76s)]
*  that's what she was whining about, is harassment and bullying? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Of course, because that requires, what, 15 minutes of work? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=243.78s)]
*  Now, these are the same types who think requiring them [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  to return to the office where they haven't been, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=250.6s)]
*  oftentimes for four years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=252.56s)]
*  That basically amounts to a hate crime. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=254.4s)]
*  I thought it was great [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=256.82s)]
*  because we have people that don't show up to work [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=258.82s)]
*  and nobody even knows if they work for the government. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=260.9s)]
*  So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=263.0s)]
*  what he's doing is saying, are you actually working? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=266.44s)]
*  What they're doing is they're trying to find out [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=269.02s)]
*  who's working for the government. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=270.76s)]
*  Are we paying other people that aren't working? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, where's all this? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=275.76s)]
*  Where's the money gone? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, not only is that not unfair to insist on accountability [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=279.56s)]
*  and fiscal sanity in government, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=284.46s)]
*  but it's also deeply patriotic [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=286.62s)]
*  because Trump and his team are showing their love for America. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=290.18s)]
*  Just like moms and dads try to stick to a budget, they try. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  They try to save money and try to make money for their family. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=296.52s)]
*  Trump wants the same for America at every level. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=299.74s)]
*  But what the DC Uniparty has done for decades [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=303.76s)]
*  has been deeply unpatriotic. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=307.2s)]
*  Printing, borrowing, and spending money [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=310.24s)]
*  like there's no tomorrow, never changing course. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=312.84s)]
*  The result ultimately being, you know, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=317.04s)]
*  if they kept going the way they were going, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=319.0s)]
*  a total collapse of the American system. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=320.6s)]
*  That's what Elon Musk has been talking about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  But Trump and his team, they celebrate America [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  by embracing sweeping reforms. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  The dark days of high taxes, crushing regulations, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=331.8s)]
*  rampant inflation, flagrant corruption, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  government weaponization and total incompetence. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Those days are over. They're over. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=342.04s)]
*  But we cannot stop now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=346.88000000000005s)]
*  We're going to push forward every single day. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=349.16s)]
*  In the immortal words of that great American hero, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=352.44s)]
*  Captain John Paul Jones, I have not yet begun to fight. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=357.0s)]
*  Now, the place went totally crazy at CPAC. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=365.72s)]
*  And I thought to myself, no wonder so many young people, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  and I know it's mostly young men, but young women too. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=373.88s)]
*  His numbers are up among young women. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=376.6s)]
*  They're excited about Trump. Think about this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=378.8s)]
*  This generation, the younger generation, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=382.96s)]
*  has heard for years that America is systemically racist. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=385.36s)]
*  They were told repeatedly to check their privilege at the door [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=390.64s)]
*  and to feel even guilty about their success, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=395.28s)]
*  guilty about their background. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=398.92s)]
*  How boring and depressing that message is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=401.12s)]
*  But Trump, he's always the candidate [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=404.64s)]
*  that always knew that America deserved and even wanted more. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=407.8s)]
*  I will convene a White House task force [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=413.0s)]
*  called Salute to America 250. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=415.2s)]
*  It will be responsible for coordinating [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=418.36s)]
*  with state and local governments [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=420.64s)]
*  to ensure not just one day of celebration, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=422.28s)]
*  but an entire year of festivities across the nation [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=425.68s)]
*  to create the Great American State Fair, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=429.48s)]
*  a unique one-year exhibition [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=431.68s)]
*  featuring pavilions from all 50 states. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=433.52s)]
*  It's going to be fabulous, the 250th anniversary, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=437.56s)]
*  now that Trump is president. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=441.52s)]
*  Imagine under Kamala Harris, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=443.04s)]
*  that would have been a depressing event. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=444.36s)]
*  Now, look, there are plenty of challenges ahead, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=446.8s)]
*  including inflation, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=448.48s)]
*  which Trump has to tackle and tackle very smartly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=449.56s)]
*  And he's given us, though, a profound opportunity [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=453.44s)]
*  to reset and revive our national spirit, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  and he's well on his way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=460.08s)]
*  And by the way, don't listen to the left. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=461.96s)]
*  This is not mindless patriotism. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=463.68s)]
*  It's how a nation survives and thrives, and that's the angle. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=466.72s)]
*  What did you do last week? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=471.48s)]
*  If you work for the federal government [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=473.2s)]
*  and you can't answer that by midnight, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=474.72s)]
*  you might be getting doged. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=476.6s)]
*  This weekend, every D.C. bureaucrat [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=478.56s)]
*  got this message in their inbox. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=480.8s)]
*  Please reply to this email with five bullets [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=483.16s)]
*  of what you accomplished last week with a deadline. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=486.08s)]
*  And if you don't answer, that's kind of your answer. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=489.44s)]
*  I thought it was great, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=493.68s)]
*  because we have people that don't show up to work, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=495.68s)]
*  and nobody even knows if they work for the government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=497.76s)]
*  So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  what he's doing is saying, are you actually working? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=503.3s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=506.3s)]
*  like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=508.12s)]
*  because a lot of people are not answering [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  because they don't even exist. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=513.84s)]
*  I can tell you what I did last week. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=516.44s)]
*  Worked on a federal holiday, plugged Dana's new book, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=518.4s)]
*  pushed Doge Dividend checks, you're welcome, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=522.52s)]
*  shut down Jessica on the 5, politely, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  and sold some Fox merch. Cha-ching. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=528.76s)]
*  Now, I came up with that in five minutes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=532.24s)]
*  If I had 48 hours like those federal workers do, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=534.84s)]
*  it would have been even better. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  But when I was putting together the list, I was inspired. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=539.64s)]
*  And now I've asked the entire primetime team [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  to send me their five bullet points [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=545.48s)]
*  on what they accomplished last week [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=546.84s)]
*  and the deadlines at 6 a.m. tomorrow. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=549.0s)]
*  And we're going to send you and show you [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=552.12s)]
*  what their bullet points are tomorrow. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=554.2s)]
*  And I'll let you know if I fired anybody. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=555.52s)]
*  Nobody on my team was angry when I sent the email, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=557.76s)]
*  but for some reason, federal workers are. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=560.72s)]
*  Tell us about this email and what it was like receiving it [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=564.52s)]
*  and what you all have talked about after getting it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=569.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  I got this email Saturday afternoon, about 3 p.m., [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  and I felt absolutely infuriated getting this email [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=577.8s)]
*  with a demand within 48 hours to provide a response [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  on what I did within the last week or face termination. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=586.68s)]
*  This is clearly an attempt from Elon Musk [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=592.36s)]
*  to harass and bully and intimidate the federal workforce. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  Putting together a list of accomplishments [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=599.8s)]
*  was maybe the most work some of these bureaucrats did all year. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=601.7199999999999s)]
*  If it's that hard for you to name five things [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=605.88s)]
*  you've accomplished in a week, that should tell you something. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=608.04s)]
*  And if it makes you mad or infuriated that you're being asked, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=610.64s)]
*  that should also tell you something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=615.4799999999999s)]
*  It tells me a lot of these federal workers [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  don't want to justify their jobs [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=618.92s)]
*  because they feel they're entitled. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=620.56s)]
*  And that's a bad attitude. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  And that attitude's about to change. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=624.56s)]
*  And was it just me or did that worker sound [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=627.24s)]
*  like she was reading from a script? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  I think I saw her eyes moving back and forth. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=630.76s)]
*  And what, has this woman never had a review? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=634.76s)]
*  If the answer is no, then that's a huge problem. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=637.88s)]
*  People are getting laid off. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=641.4s)]
*  Tell me why you should stay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=643.4s)]
*  If the CEO of Bank of America asks me, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=645.72s)]
*  Jesse, what did you accomplish last week? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=648.4s)]
*  I don't run to CNN and cry. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=651.72s)]
*  I don't have to answer that question. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=653.8000000000001s)]
*  I can go to CNN and cry and tell the anchor I'm mad. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=655.76s)]
*  If I've been doing a good job, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=660.12s)]
*  I'm psyched for the opportunity to present my boss [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=661.68s)]
*  with a list of my amazing accomplishments [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=664.92s)]
*  so I can get a raise and a promotion [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=667.2s)]
*  and keep helping the company. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=668.92s)]
*  You either have a winning attitude [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=671.4s)]
*  or the attitude of a loser. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=674.56s)]
*  The winner loves the email. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=676.48s)]
*  The loser is whiny. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=678.52s)]
*  This nonsensical email from, from Elon Musk [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=680.96s)]
*  acting like we're in kindergarten. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=686.92s)]
*  The new Trump administration is reveling [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=688.8s)]
*  in its bare-knuckle approach to governance. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=692.6s)]
*  This is so sloppy with the way Elon Musk is handling this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=695.8s)]
*  Why is the media treating these workers [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=701.16s)]
*  like the CEO's spoiled brat son? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=703.28s)]
*  You know, who comes and goes as he pleases, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=706.12s)]
*  drinks at lunch and harasses the secretaries. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  He's untouchable. We all know the guy. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=710.8s)]
*  The media is treating the federal workforce [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=713.92s)]
*  like they're untouchable. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=715.76s)]
*  Oh, you can't make them come to the office. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=717.56s)]
*  You can't fire them. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  You definitely can't log into their computers [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  and you can't email them on a weekend. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  These are public servants. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=726.36s)]
*  They're supposed to serve the public. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=728.68s)]
*  When we ask, how are you serving us? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=731.36s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=734.28s)]
*  Maybe it's because they're not serving us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=736.16s)]
*  They're serving themselves. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=738.28s)]
*  Journalist Chris Ruffo just uncovered a deep state sex chat [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  at the National Security Agency. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  Chat logs show intel officials were using a chat room [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=748.04s)]
*  to share their fetishes and kinks [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=751.96s)]
*  and brag about getting sex changes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=754.2s)]
*  And it goes back two years, a transgender sex chat [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=757.32s)]
*  while they were on the clock. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=762.4s)]
*  When you think about it, this was a taxpayer-funded [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=764.44s)]
*  transgender sex chat. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=766.56s)]
*  Here's a taste, viewer warning. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=768.76s)]
*  This one guy had just said his manhood surgically removed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=772.28s)]
*  One of the weirdest things that gives me euphoria is when I pee. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=776.36s)]
*  I don't have to push anything down to make sure it aims right. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=780.48s)]
*  Here's another. Getting my blank zapped by a laser was shocking. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=785.48s)]
*  I'm fine. I'll just do one more. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=790.68s)]
*  This one guy is talking about how excited he is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=795.0s)]
*  that the bulge is gone [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  and he can wear bikinis after his sex change surgeries. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=800.12s)]
*  I know. And these are intel officials. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=803.12s)]
*  These people are in charge of guarding the nation's deepest [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=806.8s)]
*  secrets and spying on our enemies. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=809.0s)]
*  How mentally tough are these people [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=812.12s)]
*  if they're having doctors chop off their body parts [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  and then celebrating it on a work computer? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=816.56s)]
*  Do you know how easy it is to blackmail somebody like that? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=820.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you know how China or Russia or the Iranians, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  what they would do if they got their hands on this? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=827.28s)]
*  First, they'd laugh. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=830.16s)]
*  But then they'd compromise every single one of these reckless agents. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=831.68s)]
*  Elon asked, what did you accomplish at work last week? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=836.5999999999999s)]
*  I sexted with my colleagues about pouring hot wax on my nipples. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=840.3599999999999s)]
*  This is what happens when 96% of the federal workforce works from home. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=845.16s)]
*  They're having sex change surgeries while they're working from home, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=849.8s)]
*  and their bosses don't even know about it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=852.8s)]
*  I bet we paid for those sex change surgeries. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=855.4s)]
*  And then they're all in the group chat all day. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=858.8s)]
*  Hey, how was your operation? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=861.48s)]
*  Mine was great. Still a little sore. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=863.28s)]
*  But now I can live my own truth. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=865.96s)]
*  If you don't report to work, you know, that's another scam. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=869.16s)]
*  You know, who the hell, if I'm staying home, I'm going to... [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=873.8s)]
*  Let's see, my golf handicap would get down to very low number. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=877.64s)]
*  You'd be shocked if I told you the real number. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  But I would be so good, I'd try and get on tour. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=884.9200000000001s)]
*  I would be so good. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=889.36s)]
*  I'd call up, I'd say, listen, I'm really working here. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=891.44s)]
*  Where are my clubs? Where are my clubs? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=894.44s)]
*  The Senate's even being put to work. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=897.76s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune is making senators work late into the night. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  And ready? They're working on Fridays now. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And no surprise, senators are already complaining. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  They want to go home. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=910.28s)]
*  Democrat Senator Mark Kelly, also a pilot, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  says he used to run a plane and fly himself home every Friday. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=914.8s)]
*  Alas, he's barely flown on that plane this year. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=918.52s)]
*  He says, unless I want to do it on the weekend, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=922.5999999999999s)]
*  and that's if I get back on the weekends. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  We're $36 trillion in debt because of guys like that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  And they're complaining they have to work on a Friday. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=932.04s)]
*  Not even a summer Friday, a Friday in February. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=934.24s)]
*  USAID has been emptied out. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=938.4s)]
*  2,000 workers were just fired. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=940.44s)]
*  Should have taken the buyout while you had the chance. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=942.52s)]
*  It does make sense, though. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=945.16s)]
*  They didn't want to leave because the gravy train [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=946.72s)]
*  was just too thick and tasty. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=949.44s)]
*  For Haiti alone, USAID doled out $2 billion in contracts. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=952.32s)]
*  Guess how much of that money actually went to Haiti? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=957.8s)]
*  2%. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=961.32s)]
*  Only 2% of the $2 billion went to where it was supposed to. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=962.9200000000001s)]
*  Half of it went to all of these aid groups based around D.C. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=967.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, you can't give it to Haiti directly, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=972.0s)]
*  they just steal the money. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=973.84s)]
*  So we're going to give it to all of our liberal friends [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  who won't steal the money, and then they'll give it to Haiti. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=977.5200000000001s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=982.08s)]
*  Are liberals just stealing from poor black people [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=984.0s)]
*  and calling it compassion? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=986.5200000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm going to tell you? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=988.24s)]
*  A New York Post report says the Red Cross [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=989.84s)]
*  raised $500 million for Haiti. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=992.24s)]
*  And that money was supposed to build homes for 130,000 people. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=995.12s)]
*  They built six. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1000.64s)]
*  $500 million to build six homes in Haiti, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1002.64s)]
*  where home is not really Mar-a-Lago. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1006.04s)]
*  And here's a juicy one for you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1009.28s)]
*  Meet Latresha Adams. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1011.16s)]
*  She was an advisor to the Biden White House. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1013.36s)]
*  How she got that job, I have no idea. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1015.52s)]
*  The Weekend reports that while she was working [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1017.48s)]
*  as a White House advisor, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1020.48s)]
*  our friend Latresha applied for a contract. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  And not just any contract, a $20 million contract. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1024.72s)]
*  This $20 million contract was for environmental justice. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1028.6s)]
*  And right before Biden leaves office, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1033.08s)]
*  he gives this $20 million contract to Latresha. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1035.08s)]
*  Her group, Young, Gifted, and Green, got the $20 million. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1038.68s)]
*  More like Young, Grifted, and Green. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1041.8s)]
*  Does Latresha have any background in environmental science? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1044.76s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1048.2s)]
*  Ten years ago, Latresha was a high school Spanish teacher. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1049.68s)]
*  She has a bachelor's in Spanish. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1053.36s)]
*  She's based in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1056.36s)]
*  Not the greenest city. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1058.04s)]
*  And you know what Biden does? Biden audits Pete Hegseth. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  This lady, Latresha, screaming for an audit. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  We used to prosecute graft at the Department of Justice. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1068.68s)]
*  I guess we don't anymore. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1071.36s)]
*  Latresha can just walk out of the White House with $20 million. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1073.36s)]
*  What did Latresha do with the $20 million? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1077.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, we went to their website. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  The only thing they did last year [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1080.76s)]
*  was the Black Maternal and Environmental Health Day. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1083.04s)]
*  They started a holiday. It's April 4th. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1087.24s)]
*  These people look really legit. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1091.52s)]
*  This is exactly why Trump wants to go visit Fort Knox. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1094.84s)]
*  We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1097.76s)]
*  And we've just started. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1103.04s)]
*  We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1104.56s)]
*  Because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1108.04s)]
*  Finding ways fraud and abuse isn't even that hard. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1111.76s)]
*  You can save money with a stroke of a pen. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1114.16s)]
*  ODNI itself is a pretty small organization [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1117.84s)]
*  compared to most other elements. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1121.24s)]
*  But even in that small organization, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1123.24s)]
*  even in that small organization, getting rid of DEI, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1125.68s)]
*  saved American taxpayers roughly $20 million. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1129.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1132.48s)]
*  Literally with the stroke of President Trump's pen. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1132.88s)]

*  But first, President Trump continues to work at record breaking speed. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1200.5200000000002s)]
*  He's showing no signs of slowing down at all earlier today. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1204.8000000000002s)]
*  He hosted French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1208.96s)]
*  for a meeting at the White House [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1211.96s)]
*  where the two addressed a number of topics [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1213.4s)]
*  and also expressed optimism about resolving the war [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1215.72s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. Let's take a look. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1220.24s)]
*  I've been elected by the American people [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1223.5600000000002s)]
*  to restore common sense to Washington [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  and indeed to the world. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1230.04s)]
*  And I believe strongly that it's in the best interest [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1231.68s)]
*  of the United States, the best interest in Europe, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1235.0s)]
*  the best interest of Ukraine, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1237.36s)]
*  and indeed the best interest of Russia to stop the killing now [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1238.9599999999998s)]
*  and bring the world to peace. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1243.28s)]
*  When I got here, one of the first calls I made [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1244.84s)]
*  was to President Putin. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1246.9199999999998s)]
*  And we were treated with great respect, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1249.08s)]
*  and they want to end this war. So that's a big thing. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  I will be meeting with President Zelensky. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1255.04s)]
*  In fact, he may come in this week or next week [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1257.36s)]
*  to sign the agreement, which would be nice. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1260.12s)]
*  I'd love to meet him. We'd meet at the Oval Office. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1263.24s)]
*  So the agreement's being worked on now. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1266.48s)]
*  They're very close to a final deal. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1269.2s)]
*  It'll be a deal with rare earths and various other things. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1271.5600000000002s)]
*  All right, President Trump also continues to score [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1276.48s)]
*  big wins on the economy. Remember, the left, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1278.72s)]
*  the media mob spent months and months and months [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1281.2s)]
*  spewing doom and gloom predictions about Donald Trump [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1284.8000000000002s)]
*  and his proposed tariffs, which are now reciprocal tariffs. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1288.0s)]
*  They'd tariff us. Okay, we'll tariff you back. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1291.04s)]
*  Well, Gabe, what arena do you want to play in? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1293.72s)]
*  Well, guess what? In response to President Trump's [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1296.1200000000001s)]
*  proposed tariffs this morning, a huge announcement from Apple. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1299.16s)]
*  A historic $500 billion investment [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1303.0s)]
*  in U.S. manufacturing and innovation. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1306.88s)]

*  on the future of American innovation. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1312.52s)]
*  This one deal is expected to create tens of thousands [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1315.0s)]
*  of new jobs and a new manufacturing plant in Texas. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  God bless Texas. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1322.64s)]
*  Now, let me say this, by the way, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1323.96s)]
*  on the issue of tariffs in Canada. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1325.5200000000002s)]
*  There's a movement that was in today's New York Post [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1327.5200000000002s)]
*  that Canadians might be boycotting the United States. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, I have a message to Canada, too. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1334.16s)]
*  If you don't appreciate everything the U.S. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1336.76s)]
*  has been doing for your national defense [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1339.16s)]
*  and we've been paying the freight for NATO [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  that you've not been paying, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1343.72s)]
*  and that has helped your economy, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1345.2800000000002s)]
*  and if you want to boo our national anthem [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1347.2800000000002s)]
*  because we call you out for not securing your border [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1350.8000000000002s)]
*  or the fact that you have tariffs on our country, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  it's not going to fly anymore. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1356.3600000000001s)]
*  Friendships have got to work both ways. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1358.0400000000002s)]
*  In Canada, you have a population of a little over 41 million people [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1359.68s)]
*  and the U.S. has over 340 million people. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1364.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm just saying, I've never supported a boycott [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1368.3600000000001s)]
*  my entire career, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1371.44s)]
*  but if this Boycott America movement from Canada gets legs, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1373.4s)]
*  then maybe I'll do something I've never done before in my career. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1377.36s)]
*  Maybe we can start and support a boycott movement of Canada. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's put the ball back in your court. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1385.36s)]
*  You might want to rethink this idea. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1387.2s)]
*  It's better off it for friends. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1389.52s)]
*  And while President Trump secures massive investments in the U.S., [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1391.04s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doge continue to identify and eliminate waste, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  fraud, abuse and corruption right here at home, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1398.36s)]
*  an effort that JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says needs to be done [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1400.76s)]
*  since the government is, quote, inefficient. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1405.12s)]
*  That's stating the obvious. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1407.0s)]
*  According to one former DOD insider, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1408.44s)]
*  Doge is sending, quote, shock waves through the Pentagon. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1412.64s)]
*  And over at the EPA, another $67 million of your money [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1416.04s)]
*  in grants for left-wing groups pushing Joe Biden's [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1420.32s)]
*  radical environmental justice mandate, that's gone. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1424.04s)]
*  And over the weekend, Fox News learned that Border Patrol [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1427.12s)]
*  has now taken control, you got to admit this is funny, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1430.2s)]
*  of the former USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C., [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1433.8s)]
*  after Elon Musk and Doge exposed the tens of billions of dollars [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1437.4s)]
*  the organism of that organization's wasteful spending. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1441.76s)]
*  Great, that's money for our kids and grandkids [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1444.56s)]
*  to pay down our debt, create the new generation of weaponry, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1446.68s)]
*  including an iron dome for the country, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1450.48s)]
*  secure our borders, become energy dominant, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1452.16s)]
*  bring back law and order. Not a bad agenda. Better alternative. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1454.6s)]
*  Now, despite all of the work that the president is doing [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1458.32s)]
*  to make our country a better place, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1461.4s)]
*  the mainstream media, legacy media mob [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1463.3999999999999s)]
*  and liberal political strategists and Democrats, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1466.56s)]
*  they just don't get it, or they don't want to get it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1469.52s)]
*  That's why you're seeing yet another reconfiguration [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1472.56s)]
*  of the mainstream media, and people no longer trust them. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1475.8s)]
*  Ask yourself, do you really think it's an accident [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  that Chuck Todd, Andrea Mitchell, Nora O'Donnell, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1481.6s)]
*  Joy Reid, Alex Wagner, all pushed either out the door [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1484.04s)]
*  or taking on reduced roles? Ask yourself. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1489.24s)]
*  In another example last week, we tried to have a conversation [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1492.56s)]
*  with our old friend, James Carville. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1495.24s)]
*  Now, to me, he's always been more reasonable as a Democrat. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1496.96s)]
*  Remember Bill Clinton, Al Gore, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1500.32s)]
*  they talked a lot about ending waste fraud and abuse, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1502.0s)]
*  but frankly, the conversation was more than frustrating. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1505.1599999999999s)]
*  We went back and forth about various numbers, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1508.74s)]
*  and then he said to fact check them. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1512.08s)]
*  All right, so we're going to do just that. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1514.0s)]
*  On the issue, he kept saying, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1516.72s)]
*  it's the lowest poll numbers ever, anybody, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1517.6799999999998s)]
*  have a president in modern history. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1519.56s)]
*  Not true, got it wrong. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1521.48s)]
*  According to the new Harvard-Harris poll [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1523.08s)]
*  just out this very day, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1524.76s)]
*  President Trump approval rating is 52%, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1526.68s)]
*  nine points above water. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1529.8s)]
*  The poll found that voters are now more optimistic [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1531.72s)]
*  about the direction of the country [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1535.0s)]
*  since the Trump administration took over. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1536.84s)]
*  And on every major issue, they support the Trump agenda. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1539.56s)]
*  Despite the disaster Biden left behind, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1543.6s)]
*  38% now say the economy is on the right track, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1545.96s)]
*  which is 10 points higher than it was only last month. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1548.6s)]
*  In fact, President Trump is outperforming Biden [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1552.2800000000002s)]
*  on handling every key issue, including immigration, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1554.72s)]
*  the economy, inflation, foreign affairs. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1557.44s)]
*  He is in the 60s and 70s when it comes to government waste, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1560.2800000000002s)]

*  The accumulated deficit over four years, more than $2 trillion less than it was under Joe Biden. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1666.8s)]
*  Now, if you take out the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, in other words, the two COVID years, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1674.08s)]

*  of waste in that organization, all for radical left-wing causes and what it would do. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1695.0s)]

*  The left does not want to talk about Donald Trump's accomplishments. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1745.32s)]
*  They don't want to talk about waste, fraud and abuse going on in our government. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1749.2s)]
*  And that's what they consider a constitutional crisis. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1753.52s)]
*  You know, the problem with the left today, if you're asking why all these Trump haters [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1756.52s)]
*  are falling by the wayside all over the corrupt state-run legacy media mob, it's because they [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1762.28s)]
*  simply hate Trump and desperately want him to fail. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1767.68s)]
*  He fails, the country fails. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1771.48s)]
*  And this reshuffling strategy of these networks, you know, you're reshuffling the decks of [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1773.36s)]
*  the Titanic, it's not going to work for them. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1777.44s)]

*  I know. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=1889.72s)]

*  Mmm, I know, Georgia. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2099.52s)]
*  In 2020, the network reported that the doctor working at an ICE detention center was performing [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  unwanted hysterectomies on immigrant women. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2109.32s)]
*  The network called the doctor the uterus collector. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  I know, that was my nickname in college. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2115.92s)]
*  Here's how they reported it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2123.7599999999998s)]
*  Just to underscore that, the allegation here is that this is a federal facility, and they [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2125.9199999999996s)]
*  have been sending immigrant women in their care, in their custody, to a doctor who has [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2130.04s)]
*  removed their reproductive organs for no medical reason and without them consenting to it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2135.54s)]
*  Nurse says that detained women told her they didn't fully understand why they were undergoing [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2140.64s)]
*  hysterectomies. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2146.3199999999997s)]
*  You talk about in the complaint a hearing from women who are detained there, talking [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2147.7999999999997s)]
*  about a specific doctor performing hysterectomies, referring to him as a uterus collector. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2152.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Chris Hayes was one of those who peddled this story about the uterus collector, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2159.36s)]
*  but his only proof was that his was missing. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2165.7200000000003s)]
*  And yes, the story sounds horrible, almost too horrible to be believed, but for people [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2173.5200000000004s)]
*  in legacy media who suspend common sense on all things Trump, it was just too good to [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2178.48s)]
*  check. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2183.44s)]
*  It had to be true, but it wasn't. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2184.44s)]
*  And the tip off right away is that these hacks would actually condemn a doctor forcibly collecting [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2188.2s)]
*  uteruses, because when it comes to kids, it's lovingly called gender affirmation care. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2192.68s)]
*  And you'd think the fact that no one else was reporting this might have been another [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2197.88s)]
*  clue for these great investigative journalists. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2202.52s)]
*  Although calling Nicole Wallace, Chris Hayes, and Rachel Maddow journalists is like calling [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2206.36s)]
*  Stacey Abrams, Jerry Nadler, and J.B. Pritzker plus-size models. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2210.44s)]
*  So how far were they off? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2219.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, the judge in the case states that there's undisputed evidence has been established that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2221.6400000000003s)]
*  there were no mass hysterectomies at the facility, and the doctor is not, quote, a uterus collector. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2227.1600000000003s)]
*  So other than that, their reporting was perfect. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2235.24s)]
*  So MSNBC has reportedly decided to settle up rather than risk a trial, but you still [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2243.08s)]
*  got to wonder how this story, this hoax, got this far. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2247.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, what was the point of the hoax in the first place? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2251.64s)]
*  To damage Trump and his determination to finally tighten the border. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2254.8399999999997s)]
*  They wanted to believe it was true. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2258.52s)]
*  You know, like when I told that flight attendant it was a war injury. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2261.08s)]
*  The anchors just love the idea that there was a sinister doctor forcibly removing uteruses [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2267.64s)]
*  so that these women couldn't have kids after entering the U.S. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2273.72s)]
*  It's so evil, so fascist, so Trumpian. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2278.44s)]
*  Seriously, how soon will Hollywood make a movie of that? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2281.72s)]
*  The evil doctor could be played by Kevin Spacey. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2285.44s)]
*  Yeah, and the uterus could be played by Peter Dinklage. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2289.56s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2301.48s)]
*  Don't try to make sense of it. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2302.6s)]
*  But again, how did they fall for this garbage? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2304.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, first, maybe they felt that if they were wrong, of course no one would check. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2308.04s)]
*  But also, any belief system is a continuum, and if you go far enough out with it, you [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2312.36s)]
*  can arrive at a very bad place, especially if you already start at a bad place. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2317.24s)]
*  Like, say, Trump is Hitler. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2322.92s)]
*  Like Trump, Hitler was also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2325.72s)]
*  It was blatant fascism meets the Jerry Springer show. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2331.48s)]
*  That sounds vaguely familiar. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2334.52s)]
*  That's because it is. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2335.72s)]
*  Similarities to what happened in Germany and what's happening now in America [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2337.72s)]
*  are just undeniable. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2341.8799999999997s)]
*  Violent, terrifying, and sometimes bizarre conspiracy theories that set the table for [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2343.0s)]
*  maybe armed resistance to a Kamala Harris win or mass acceptance of American fascism. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2348.12s)]
*  Let me know when you guys are finished fighting amongst yourselves who I gotta vote for in [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2354.84s)]
*  November to keep Hitler out the White House. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2359.4s)]
*  If it's Biden in a coma, I'ma vote for Biden in a coma. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2361.0s)]
*  You'd vote for Biden in a coma, but why not? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2365.08s)]
*  You did the same thing in 2020. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2367.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, coma patients are blinking out Morse code for, come on, guys, we're not that bad. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2369.7999999999997s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2383.7999999999997s)]
*  But you can see how joy laid the groundwork for the hoax. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2384.3599999999997s)]
*  So what's left of MSNBC? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2387.64s)]
*  Well, they're replacing joy with a three-person panel. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  So if it's a slow news day, they can call each other racist. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2392.6s)]
*  Which raises the other question. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2396.44s)]
*  Maddo and the others pushed the uterus story. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2398.44s)]
*  Reed did not. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2400.92s)]
*  So why is joy fired and the rest of them aren't? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2402.44s)]
*  Is it because they're all white? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2405.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, here's a case where joy can actually cry racism. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2410.1200000000003s)]
*  And finally, for once, it might be true. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2414.44s)]
*  Welcome to tonight's guest. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2419.0s)]
*  He was in the movie 50 Shades of Grey. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2421.96s)]
*  He was in the movie 50 Shades of White. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2424.52s)]
*  Fox News contributor Tom Shalhou. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2427.24s)]
*  Her stances are courageous and her laugh is contagious. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2431.88s)]
*  Host of the Michelle Tafoya podcast, Michelle Tafoya. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2435.56s)]
*  The hospital gown that won't close was his idea. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2440.6s)]
*  Host of the past, Dr. Drew on Rumble, Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2444.68s)]
*  And she can cover about and make liberals tap out. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2449.8s)]
*  Host of Outkick Good Morning, Charlie Arnold. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2453.56s)]
*  I think we got, I want to display an up to date clip of Joy Reed responding to her firing. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2459.16s)]
*  Do we have that? Let's play that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2463.96s)]
*  And that I'm sorry. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2466.2s)]
*  That what I was doing had value. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2471.08s)]
*  Had value. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2476.92s)]
*  And in the end, I'm sorry, I try not to cry on TV. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2477.72s)]
*  Hmm. Now I feel sad. I'm just kidding. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2480.92s)]
*  It's really hard, Tom, to feel sympathy for somebody who demonized millions of people, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2486.52s)]
*  who put targets on people's back by calling them racist, white supremacists, or Tom Shalhouz. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2491.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it was like the only one she let off the hook was Hitler. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2496.44s)]
*  I didn't know that. You know, that was amazing that from that monologue, she was like, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2501.5600000000004s)]
*  oh, Hitler was also known as a clown who could be kept in line. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2505.88s)]
*  I don't remember reading about that. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2509.8s)]
*  What German generals were like, oh, he's such a clown. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2513.08s)]
*  Didn't happen. But I do now after seeing her cry, I do feel bad for her. I mean, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2519.8s)]
*  at least she kept things interesting. I don't know who they're going to replace her with. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2524.52s)]
*  Maybe, you know, we had Jen Psaki went from the White House to MSNBC. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2527.8s)]
*  Maybe, you know, you got Morning Joe. What about Evening Joe? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  No. Evening Joe, but I mean, Evening Sleepy Joe. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2533.88s)]
*  Why not? To be like, welcome to normalarchy. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2539.56s)]
*  Can I stop stories? I'm still alive. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2546.28s)]
*  And I don't mean Joe. I mean, like, give the show to me. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2551.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2555.1600000000003s)]
*  You were Joe. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2557.1600000000003s)]
*  I would watch some of that for sure. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2559.32s)]
*  So, Michelle, do you get a sense that MSNBC, this is not a drastic change. They're unloading the [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2561.3199999999997s)]
*  baggage, but it doesn't feel like, oh, we're moving to the middle with the replacements. I mean, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2568.12s)]
*  Simone Sanders, Michael Steele. Is that his name, Michael Steele? I can't remember. Never Trumper. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2573.56s)]
*  I mean, these are all the same. It's the same characters. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2578.7599999999998s)]
*  It's, yeah, I came from the NBC family. My most recent television job in sports was the NBC family. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2581.56s)]
*  And so I know some of the people who are involved in some of this stuff. And I think that they would [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2589.4s)]
*  like to move at least to the middle. They would like to reflect more of America. But as you said, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2595.0s)]
*  I don't know that this trio necessarily does that because they're all of one mind. But I want to get [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2601.96s)]
*  to that Uris Collector story too, because that name is incredible, right? And it reminds me of [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2608.28s)]
*  Covington, remember? Yes. Our friend, I can't remember his name now. Guy who won a lot of money [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2617.24s)]
*  off CNN. A lot of money. Yeah. Sammon, Nicholas Sammon. Yeah. And it reminds me also of when AOC [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2622.8399999999997s)]
*  went to the border and cried and said that people were drinking water out of toilets. Yes. Now, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2629.9599999999996s)]
*  that was never proven either, but she was allowed to say that. Yeah, she said it like it was a bad [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2637.9599999999996s)]
*  thing. But we also have now, we have George Stephanopoulos and that $15 million settlement [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2642.28s)]
*  about the rape thing. And we've got, so the lawsuits are starting to kind of pile up. And I think [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2652.0400000000004s)]
*  that networks are going, you know, we don't want to have to give away all this money all of the time. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2658.6000000000004s)]

*  sued them. Yes. Because his life could be ruined by, and these people need to be put on notice. They [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2712.44s)]

*  That's true. To be a woman of color and get fired during Black History Month, you really have to be [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFE5C-QjJY&t=2770.6800000000003s)]
