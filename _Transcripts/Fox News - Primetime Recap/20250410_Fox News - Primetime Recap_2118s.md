# Fox News Highlights - April, 9 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g)
*  across the globe that's good for the American economy. And by the way, these countries would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=0.0s)]
*  be very wise if you're watching internationally. You should seek out your deal as soon as possible. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=5.68s)]
*  I'm going to make a prediction. The first 15 deals will be much more favorable than the last [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=12.48s)]
*  15 deals. Just a guess, but what do I know? I'm just a talk show host. Now, the longer the wait, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=17.76s)]
*  the higher the price will be. But don't forget, dozens of foreign countries, multinational [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=22.96s)]
*  businesses, they have already announced a whopping, look at this list, look at it, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=27.84s)]
*  a whopping five to $7 trillion just by the threat of implementing tariffs. That's money [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=33.2s)]
*  that's going to be spent in infrastructure, manufacturing, auto plants, chip companies [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=39.92s)]
*  right here in the United States of America. Why? In order to avoid any trade uncertainty. They're [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  like, yeah, let's build in America. Perfect time. Donald Trump's in office. Now this means more high [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=51.44s)]
*  paying career jobs for the American people. That means more industry. That means less dependence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=56.72s)]
*  on other nations. For example, we're far too dependent on other countries for pharmaceuticals. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=63.2s)]
*  Oh, what if COVID 2.0, God forbid happens. We're too dependent on getting semiconductors abroad. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=69.28s)]
*  We're going to make them here in America. By the way, this is going to be the new normal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=75.2s)]
*  The old establishment institutionalist mindset is now officially dead. This is what America first [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=80.64s)]
*  looks like. This is what it means to be strong. This is what it means that America is not going [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=88.8s)]
*  to be pushed around any longer. And there was even more good news tonight. Communist China, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=94.4s)]
*  they're finally getting held accountable. I'm pretty happy about it. And I'll explain in a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=99.36s)]
*  second. Unlike Americans, you know, and partners, let's take a look first. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=103.04s)]
*  This was driven by the president's strategy. He and I had a long talk on Sunday and this was [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=108.24s)]
*  his strategy all along. And that, you know, you might even say that he go to China into [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=114.56s)]
*  a bad position. They responded, they have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=122.16s)]
*  And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not retaliate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=129.52s)]
*  It wasn't a hard message. Don't retaliate. Things will turn out well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=137.04s)]
*  That was the message. It's pretty clear. If you want free and fair trade, you can have it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=142.16s)]
*  If you want reciprocal tariffs, you can have that too. If you want to try and take advantage [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=146.16s)]
*  of America, that you can't have. Unlike partners that we have around the globe, China has no [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  interest in good faith negotiations. They've shown no good faith negotiations up till now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=156.88s)]
*  That may change. Now they started a trade war that frankly China cannot win. President Xi, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=162.4s)]
*  let me tell you, if you hear about this show somewhere in China, at some point in the coming [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=169.36s)]
*  days, you are playing chicken with the wrong guy. Even before Trump's latest 125% tariff on your [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=173.84s)]
*  country, China's currency was already crashing. It's now at the lowest point since 2007. It is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=180.72s)]
*  going lower. And mark my words, President Xi will be begging for access to America's markets [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=187.04s)]
*  as he watches one country after another, after another, after another, make a free and fair trade [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=193.12s)]
*  deal with the United States of America. China's economy also depends on America's lucrative [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=198.64s)]
*  market. They want your money too. Everybody around the world wants your money. They need us to buy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  their cheap products in bulk. Millions of Chinese citizens will be out of work without our whole [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=210.16s)]
*  cold hard cash. They'll be stuck. Meanwhile, China's retaliatory tariffs, they don't have a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=217.68s)]
*  huge impact on the U.S. They've been ripping us off for decades. Now just look at what they do. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=223.04s)]
*  Look at what they charge us. Look at how they have abused us. Look at how they rip you off. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=228.4s)]
*  And we've allowed this to happen for 50 or 60 years. How stupid are we? This is now coming to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=235.28s)]
*  an end. Well before Donald Trump, the CCP imposed massive tariffs against American products. Look at [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  that. Look at everything that you can think of, you know, and that prevents us from competing in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=247.04s)]
*  China. They won't allow our products in China, but this is about so much more than trade. The [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=252.56s)]
*  Communist Party of China, they are a ruthless, sloppy adversary that continually harms the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=257.84s)]
*  American people and our allies around the globe. They caused COVID-19. They lied about it with the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=264.4s)]
*  help of the WHO. They tried to hide it from the U.S. and the world. It cost the United States [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=270.0s)]
*  and the world precious time. Many lives were lost in the process. Every year they steal what is the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=275.76s)]
*  equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American intellectual property, including [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  top secret military technology. They have hacked the U.S. Treasury Department, Verizon, AT&T. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  They routinely spy on politicians, business leaders, talk show hosts, and other Americans, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=293.52s)]
*  and maybe even some of you watching tonight. According to the House Homeland Security Committee, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  the FBI opens a new intel case against China every 12 hours. They're not friends of ours. They've not [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=304.64s)]
*  shown friendship towards us. And let's not forget the 250,000 Americans who died from Chinese fentanyl [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=310.32s)]
*  smuggled into the U.S. to poison your children. Now this ends with Donald Trump. Chi, you've been [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=317.6s)]
*  put on notice. The old way of doing things are over. America will prosper with or without you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=324.0s)]
*  You're going to feel pain if you continue to fight with the United States of America. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  It's your choice. Make a deal. The legacy media mob will continue to get it wrong. Here's a quick example. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=333.6s)]
*  President Trump's global trade war is entering a new and dangerous phase. If he tanks the entire [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  what do you call it? The stock market. The stock market. What happens? Then all his billionaire [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=348.56s)]
*  friends can swoop in and buy everything low. That's not an original idea. That's Hakeem [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  Jeffrey said that. This is an authoritarian president who understands nothing about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=357.04s)]
*  international trade, breaking the global economy so that he can get other countries [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=362.48s)]
*  to call him up and grovel. We get so much of our lumber, our two by fours, from Canada. What's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=367.36s)]
*  where we get it from? Canada. We get our newsprint from up there for newspapers. The fact is we get [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=372.88s)]
*  it. What are we going to do? Have more lumber made in the United States now? What is our plan now? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=377.76s)]
*  Oh, we're not going to import wood. So we're going to make more wood. We're going to create more wood. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that it? I don't think we are in a position to simply replicate the imports coming into this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  country with our own products. It can't always be done. And I think if a woods example of that, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=391.84s)]
*  wood, are we going to make more wood in this country because of our trade deal? I don't think so. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=397.52s)]
*  Ask yourself a question. Are you going to take economic advice from Joyless Behar over at [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=403.44s)]
*  ABC Disney's The View or that idiot Chris Matthews on MSDNC? Here's the difference between Trump and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=408.4s)]
*  these overpaid idiots on TV while they panic and sell fear constantly and hatred and rage against [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=415.28s)]
*  all things Trump. He's in a perpetual state of America first negotiations. And now that he has [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=422.8s)]
*  the world's attention, which he got, he has now proven that he means what he says. The old ways [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=429.28s)]
*  of doing things are over. America's new golden age is already underway and you will benefit [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  as a result of his spine, his backbone and his strength. That's my prediction. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=460.08s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=464.55999999999995s)]
*  That's the most applause I've heard since Chris Wallace left. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=468.32s)]
*  Happy Wednesday, everyone. So according to a report, the federal government has forked over [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=473.28s)]
*  $4.6 billion for new furniture since October of 2020. Amazing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=477.44s)]
*  Mostly because one man keeps breaking his chair. But it's it is nuts. It is nuts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=486.0s)]
*  Uber released its annual list of the most unique items left in the back seat. And in first place [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  was a fake head with human hair. I think we have a picture of this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=499.68s)]
*  No, I think that's a real head with fake hair. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=507.44s)]
*  So AOC is being called out for flying first class to speak at a Bernie Sanders fight oligarchy rally. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=509.92s)]
*  I know we haven't seen this kind of hypocrisy since R. Kelly told me not to pee on the toilet seat. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Because he peed on people. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=529.28s)]
*  Financial experts predict that Trump's tariffs may increase the cost of Botox. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=532.96s)]
*  So are its regular users concerned? More important, how could you tell? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=537.28s)]
*  Pop star Ed Sheeran joined tonight's show host Jimmy Fallon for a music performance [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  in a New York City subway. It's the first time commuters [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=557.76s)]
*  threw themselves in front of oncoming trains. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=561.68s)]
*  KFC is now offering a fried chicken flavored toothpaste. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it goes great with my gravy scented deodorant said one man. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=572.4s)]
*  Chris Christie is so happy you found him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=581.68s)]
*  Scientists have created a gum that traps the herpes virus. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=586.0s)]
*  But doctors say the hard part will be getting the gum out of the pubic hair. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  That is either the worst joke I've ever said or the greatest joke. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=597.76s)]
*  According to a new study, having a pet boosts well-being as much as having a spouse. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=608.88s)]
*  It's true. And you can bury both in the backyard. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=613.76s)]
*  Supporters of Dolly Parton have signed a petition to rename the Nashville airport [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=618.72s)]
*  the Parton from Parton. Yeah, every flight will be out of gate triple D. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  Finally, a California woman is using the world's longest tongue to play Jenga. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=631.12s)]
*  Guess who just became a big fan of Jenga. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=636.88s)]
*  One, one time, one time. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  So what's the primary mechanism of political survival for most politicians? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  Kicking the can down the road. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=653.92s)]
*  They know never to deal with a problem when it arises because action always involves risk. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  So instead they offer platitudes instead of solutions, hoping the status quo gets them [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=661.6s)]
*  reelected and until it's time, of course, to cash in and become a lobbyist. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  But today we have a leader who's kicking nothing down the road. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=670.96s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump sees the can, picks it up and crushes it with his bare hands. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=674.88s)]
*  Think about it. Doge, trade, deporting gangs, men and women's sports, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=680.08s)]
*  getting Rosie O'Donnell on a plane to Ireland. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=686.08s)]
*  I know. He's tackled all those issues head on in just 90 days. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=690.0s)]
*  Previously, a typical Democrat or Republican would have looked at the deficit, trade, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=698.6400000000001s)]
*  and immigration as unsolvable problems simply because solving them would cause a problem for [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=703.6s)]
*  them. But Trump, he never saw a problem he didn't want to fix. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=709.28s)]
*  And now you can add drug cartels to his list of cans he wants to crush. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=713.28s)]
*  First, he labeled them foreign terrorist organizations and now according to NBC News, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=718.24s)]
*  the administration is considering taking out those cartels with drone strikes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=722.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  Drones. Drones on cartels. It's a modern solution to a modern problem, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=728.96s)]
*  like using a robot to feed live mice to the view. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=736.64s)]
*  And your hands are safe. But bombing cartels? I wonder where they might have gotten that idea. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  It's time to take out cartels in Mexico. Bomb the **** out of them. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=751.76s)]
*  It'll be over in minutes. And if the operation starts up somewhere else, you bomb that too. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=757.68s)]
*  Mowing down cartels would be no different than mowing the lawn. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=762.4s)]
*  And I know how to mow a lawn now that Jose's been deported. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=766.56s)]
*  RIP, Jose. Taking care of your kids. But that was three years ago when the only [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=773.3599999999999s)]
*  droning was the sound of Biden's life alert. The difference this time is we got a president who's [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=780.0s)]
*  actually doing something about it. As one senior DEA official under Biden puts it, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=785.76s)]
*  politics aside, Trump is not **** around with this stuff. True, while the Dems think misgendering is [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=790.0s)]
*  violence, Trump thinks violence is violence and knows how to deal with it, with military action. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=796.24s)]
*  After all, these are brutally violent drug dealers with machine guns who don't think twice [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=802.72s)]
*  about beheading anyone who looks at them the wrong way. Fact is, they've killed more Americans than [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=806.16s)]
*  Steve Doocy's cookbook. Droning them makes all the sense in the world. It might seem extreme to some, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=810.72s)]
*  but that's only because it's viewed in the context of their own cowardice and neglect. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=819.2s)]
*  These are the same people who waved through the violent illegal criminals and pointed them on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=823.2s)]
*  night flights, gave them hotel rooms paid for by you and me. Hell, they didn't just kick the can [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=827.44s)]
*  down the road. They gave that can three meals, free flights, and a hotel room with Wi-Fi. Now, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=833.28s)]
*  Trump's been floating the idea of drone strikes on cartel leaders for a while, not because he's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=839.44s)]
*  bloodthirsty or because he's bored, but because, shocking as this sounds, it might work, which is [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=843.7600000000001s)]
*  always Trump's metric. And it beats depending on Mexico. Hell, you'd be safer chugging Tijuana [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=848.96s)]
*  spring water. I mean, there are law enforcement's made up of the cartels themselves. Now, you can [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=854.4000000000001s)]
*  debate its legality, but look, we send eight figure checks to Zelensky, never get a receipt, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=860.24s)]
*  and we're killing people who've done nothing to us thousands of miles away. Apparently, that's legal, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  but killing terrorists at our border isn't. Of course, Mexico's president says bombing cartels [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=870.8s)]
*  won't address the root of the issue. Really? Doesn't wiping out the dudes who sling these drugs [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=875.92s)]
*  address the root issue? If you can't contain El Chapo, then your opinions are El Crapo. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, we love Mexico. Their food's amazing, and it's still the best place to flee when you've [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=887.52s)]
*  accidentally killed a spouse. But their government, about as reliable as birth control from the dollar [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=891.52s)]
*  store. Their cops are bought off, their mayors are in hiding, their military has all the firepower of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=898.24s)]
*  a six pack of Odools. So yeah, Trump is saying what no one else will. If you won't clean up, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=908.0s)]
*  your yard, we'll do it for you because it's growing into ours. And if that means a drone here or there, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=913.2800000000001s)]
*  it's better than letting fentanyl kill tens of thousands of Americans a year. Drones are quick, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=915.76s)]
*  they're precise, and they're covered by Radio Shack's 90-day warranty. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=920.5600000000001s)]

*  how is this any different than hitting bin Laden in Pakistan? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=989.52s)]
*  Isn't it, doesn't that put them on the same kind of turf? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=992.72s)]
*  Yeah, it does. It opens up all sorts of opportunities, right? And by the way, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=996.4s)]
*  I don't know if you can buy birth control at the dollar store. I've never seen it, but I'm gonna... [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=999.6s)]

*  You're researching right now, aren't you? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1009.04s)]
*  It depends... [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1010.3199999999999s)]

*  But here, look, as far as the drug cartels and droning and killing the members that are [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1036.56s)]
*  responsible for all this death and destruction, yeah, I mean, it's about time, right? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1042.32s)]
*  And so we should be doing that. And the agency, the CIA, for example, is looking at the legalities. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1047.12s)]
*  They're trying to, you know, you gotta get your ducks in a row, which is not as easy as you would [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  think, because they're ducks. But it's actually probably the next step that we're taking. We're [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1057.6s)]
*  already doing overflights of Mexico with the blessing of the Mexican government to do [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  surveillance and signals intercepts and, you know, a variety of other things. So arming those [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1069.04s)]
*  bad boys and taking out some of these leaders. Look, I worked the drug wars, right, when I was [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1074.96s)]
*  in the job. And you could take out warehouses full of gear and there would be no change in what was [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1079.92s)]
*  happening in the business, right? No change in street price, nothing, because there's so much [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1087.12s)]
*  gear out there. You take out some of those top leaders, right? And then what do you do? You get [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1091.12s)]
*  them fighting amongst themselves, right? That's a good thing. So I'm all about this. I'm very glad [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1096.16s)]
*  to see them doing this. And to your point, you're right. Once you label them as foreign terrorist [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1102.16s)]
*  organizations, that opens up all sorts of possibilities, including killing them. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1106.0s)]
*  Is there any argument against this? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1116.24s)]
*  I don't think a sound argument against it. I'm sure Democrats will try to put any number of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1118.5600000000002s)]
*  obstacles in the way to say that this is not something that should or could be done, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1122.96s)]
*  but it's good to see that there will be an actual war on drugs in this country because [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1126.72s)]
*  those cartels have killed more Americans than ISIS and Al Qaeda combined. These are terrorists. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  What they are doing to Americans and American families and neighborhoods with these drugs, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  with the human trafficking that's going on, the modern day slave labor that's happening, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1140.72s)]
*  yeah, take them out. Don't apologize for it. And if Democrats want to say it's not legal, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  to your point, we take out terrorists all over the world. If they're at our doorstep, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1149.52s)]
*  why would we want them there? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1153.36s)]
*  Well, and here's a scary statistic. We've lost more Americans to fentanyl than we lost in wars [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1154.56s)]
*  since World War II. Yeah, that's crazy. So fentanyl has given drugs a bad name. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1161.84s)]
*  I think it was Bon Jovi. That was a lot of bad news. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1169.44s)]
*  It does. It does. Cocaine's off the hook. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1172.16s)]
*  Yeah. But no, you can't even buy cocaine because it has fentanyl in it. You can't get by. Any kind [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1175.4399999999998s)]
*  of street drug has some of it in it. And it's like you're playing with your life, Emily. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1182.56s)]
*  That's what I told you. Quit, baby. Stop. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1188.4799999999998s)]

*  We're glad you're here. Anyway, I'm sorry. What are your thoughts? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1198.8s)]
*  That, yes, a quarter of a million Americans have died from fentanyl. And I love how you put it [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1203.04s)]
*  because at the end of the day, as we're learning about the billions of dollars that we've been [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1208.48s)]
*  wasting as Americans, I would gladly fork over as much as I have to nail these cartels to finally [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1212.72s)]
*  secure our border. And here's the thing about the Mexican president saying, well, it's not going [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1220.08s)]
*  to address the root causes and everything else. But that's why what President Trump is doing is [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1223.6s)]
*  so brilliant because he is totally deploying a full constellation of exactly what will. He is [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1227.76s)]
*  stifling out China, who's the one that is producing all the fentanyl going through Mexico. He is [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEFJgwxkx4g&t=1234.48s)]
