# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 28, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw)
*  We're going to get into all the details and moments, but first, our country, our border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=4.8s)]
*  President Trump is doing what his millions of supporters, new and old, are begging for. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=8.72s)]
*  His administration is finally enforcing the border and carrying out mass deportations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=13.76s)]
*  Now, the total number rounded up so far is nearly 5,000. Remember, 15 million are here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=20.72s)]
*  And a lot of the ones just picked up and rounded up are hardened criminals, including murderers, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=26.56s)]
*  accused child rapists, and Tren de Uragua gang members. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And not just in places like Denver, where we knew that Tren de Uragua story really erupted, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  but also in the Big Apple as well. Last night, New York got a little safer, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  and the new DHS secretary was on the scene to capture the ICE operation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=49.28s)]
*  But rather than breathing a sigh of relief, rather than stepping up to help make America safer, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=55.6s)]
*  working with the Trump administration, liberal officials in cities and states [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=61.28s)]
*  plagued by crime, including migrant crime, are siding with illegals. Brandon Johnson in Chicago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=66.08s)]
*  What this administration is attempting to do, he's attempting to get us to surrender our humanity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=75.6s)]
*  We're not going to do that in Chicago. There's a real goal here to stoke fear [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=82.16s)]
*  into the American people. Of course, that's a lie. American citizens have no reason to fear, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=86.56s)]
*  unless they're someone involved in human or drug trafficking themselves, and they have something to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  fear. But the empathy always goes one way for these open borders fanatics, to the poor illegals. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=98.0s)]
*  Because to the fanatics, they're not really illegal aliens. They're not even illegal immigrants. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=105.84s)]
*  They're simply undocumented Democrats. This from New York AG Letitia James. She says, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=113.44s)]
*  Think about this. Whether people's rights are being violated? Now remember, she's talking about [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=122.0s)]
*  illegal aliens who had no right to be here. So what about the rights of this poor woman, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=129.84s)]
*  Debrina Kaum, 56 years old, who's been in prison for a year, and she's talking about illegal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=136.0s)]
*  aliens who have no right to be here? So what about the rights of this poor woman, Debrina Kaum, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=143.52s)]
*  57 years of age, who was allegedly murdered by illegal alien Sebastian Zepeda Khalil from Guatemala, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  who by the way was deported himself in 2018, only to cross the border again? On December 22nd, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=158.64s)]
*  Zepeda Khalil casually walked up to the bench where she was sitting, pulled a lighter from his pocket, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=165.28s)]
*  and then set her on fire. She screamed in agony as she died. Yeah, and of course, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=172.16s)]
*  this man was in the United States illegally. We know that. 33 years of age. Again, is that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=179.84s)]
*  individual someone we should actually fight for? Fight for the rights of those people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=185.76s)]
*  But the slow rolling border invasion that settled 15 million illegals here has already cost the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=192.32s)]
*  American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, and it has brutalized countless lives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=197.28s)]
*  Not to mention how many entry-level jobs are being taken by illegals, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=202.88s)]
*  boxing first-time legal job seekers out of the workplace entirely in some cases. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=206.8s)]
*  And at her first press briefing as White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=212.24s)]
*  was more than ready to answer the usual pro-illegal alien chorus from the media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=216.8s)]
*  ICE arrested 1,179 undocumented immigrants on Sunday, but nearly half of them, 566 of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  migrants, appear to have no prior criminal record besides entering the country illegally, which is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  a civil crime, not a, it's not criminal. It's a federal crime. He said he was going to focus on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=234.24s)]
*  those violent offenders first. So violent offenders no longer the predicate for these people to be [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=240.0s)]
*  deported. He has focused on launching the largest mass deportation operation in American history [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=244.8s)]
*  of illegal criminals. And if you are an individual, a foreign national who illegally [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal. Yes, illegal means illegal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=254.56s)]
*  But remember the elites love their cheap labor. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=263.12s)]
*  3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since president Trump came back into office. Can you just tell us [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=272.08s)]
*  All of them, because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore they are criminals [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn't see it that way. So [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=280.24s)]
*  it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=283.92s)]
*  criminal, but that's exactly what they are. Oh, we're going to get into her performance today, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=287.84s)]
*  which was masterful in a little bit, but hallelujah. Now never forget though, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=292.0s)]
*  one of the other reasons the left loves wave after wave of illegal immigrants, new converts. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=297.2s)]
*  I mean, most people are onto their game at this point, but millions of illegals, many of whom are [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=305.04s)]
*  sadly, and this has already reported illiterate in their own languages, they're ripe for the left's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=310.0s)]
*  anti-American propaganda. So they're new brainwashed activists who will be, you know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=316.08s)]
*  I think sought after to protest and they hope eventually vote. Eventually they want them all [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=322.96s)]
*  to speak like this. What they actually do behind the scenes, they trust will not really get out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=330.0s)]
*  And it's part of a different agenda they have, which is really to make America white again. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=337.2s)]
*  You start having Gestapo raids in America and we start becoming a country where, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=342.08s)]
*  as in East Germany, a knock on the door is the thing people are thinking about. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=348.24s)]
*  Yes, yes. After it failed miserably in the 2024 presidential election against Trump, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  they're back to the Hitler routine again. It's always a sure sign they're losing the argument. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=361.52s)]
*  So what do we expect? So doing right by our workers, our citizens, our legal immigrants, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=366.4s)]
*  our border and our budgets requires that we keep the focus on enforcing the law. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=375.52s)]
*  Those who wish to come here will need to come legally or not at all. It's our country and our [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  border and that's the angle. Swagger's back in the White House and it's not just coming from the oval. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=389.28s)]
*  The briefing room today felt a little different. Caroline Levitt, for the first time, was behind [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=395.28s)]
*  the podium and there was not a binder in sight. The press secretary said, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=401.76s)]
*  my binder is in my head. And right away she said a new tone. While I vowed to provide the truth from [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=406.88s)]
*  this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard. We know for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=419.28s)]
*  this president, about his family, and we will not accept that. We will call you out when we feel that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=424.56s)]
*  your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House. So yes, I will hold myself [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=431.36s)]
*  to the truth and I expect everyone in this room to do the same. Caroline Levitt's 27 has a baby, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=437.6s)]
*  not a binder, has access to the president and can speak English. Oh and her hair is as golden as the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=442.96s)]
*  age we're in. She didn't waste anyone's time with shenanigans. She came right out and announced the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=449.76s)]
*  drones in Jersey were ours. I do have news directly from the president of the United States that was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=454.88s)]
*  just shared with me in the Oval Office from President Trump directly, an update on the New Jersey drones. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=461.52s)]
*  After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=468.88s)]
*  authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons. Many of these drones were [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  also hobbyists, recreational, and private individuals that enjoy flying drones. In time, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  in the in time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy. So Biden lied. The whole [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=488.32s)]
*  administration acted like we were crazy and we were right. We were just testing out some new gadgets [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  over our own territory. It wasn't the Iranians or the Chinese or aliens. It was Joe. After that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=501.2s)]
*  revelation, the media wanted to move on and they blamed Trump for inflation. Egg prices have [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=508.24s)]
*  skyrocketed since President Trump took office. So what specifically is he doing to lower those costs [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=514.16s)]
*  for Americans? Really glad you brought this up because there is a lot of reporting out there [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=519.76s)]
*  that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs. I would like to point [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=524.08s)]
*  out to each and every one of you that in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office or upstairs [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=529.6s)]
*  in the residence sleeping, I'm not so sure, egg prices increased 65% in this country. What's also [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=535.2s)]
*  contributing to that is that the Biden administration and the Department of Agriculture directed the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=547.28s)]
*  country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage. Reporters kept trying to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  play games and it didn't go well. How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=557.76s)]
*  country illegally? All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=563.92s)]
*  they are criminals as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn't see [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=567.6s)]
*  it that way. So it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=571.28s)]
*  laws as a criminal, but that's exactly what they are. The culture shifting, the law is the law, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=575.52s)]
*  no more DEI hires. And if you don't want to work, bye bye. Trump offering buyouts to bureaucrats who [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=580.16s)]
*  don't want to return to the office five days a week. If you don't want to do a 40 hour work week [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=586.72s)]
*  in person like the rest of us, then these remote rent seekers can resign with severance and benefits [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=592.08s)]
*  until September. Over at the Department of Justice, they're calling it quote a wholesale demolition. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=597.6s)]
*  Every lawyer who worked on Jan six cases is getting pink slipped. Quote, it feels like a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=605.12s)]
*  nonviolent war. It's just wild. Everybody's a sitting duck and these people have no power [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=611.2s)]
*  or control over the situation. People are just in a state of shock and devastated. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=616.72s)]
*  This administration wants folks dialed in hard at work and up early. Christy Noem up at the crack of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=622.96s)]
*  dawn, 2 a.m. suited up in an ice vest overseeing the first migrant raids in Manhattan. Less than [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=628.96s)]
*  48 hours after her confirmation, Noem's out icing illegals, taking out the worst first, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=636.32s)]
*  getting dirt bags off the streets is what she calls it. She said she was inspired by her dad. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  We were building fence, stretching wires and out there putting up about a mile and a half of this [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  fence. And he turned to me and he said, Christy, where's the post mall, which is the post pounder [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=655.7600000000001s)]
*  that you post the, pound the posts in with. And I turned to him and I said, it's in the truck. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=660.24s)]
*  And he said, go get it. So with my dad, you ran everywhere you went. I turned and ran to the truck, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  grabbed the post mall, brought it back to him, handed it to him. And as I handed it to him, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  he said, you should know what I need before I know what I need. And I remember being a 10 year old [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=676.56s)]
*  girl thinking, how am I ever going to know what he needs before he knows what he needs? But what he [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=683.04s)]
*  was doing was teaching us to think ahead and to think three steps ahead of what he needed. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=689.68s)]
*  This whole administration's operating three steps ahead. Tom Homan pinched 1200 migrants yesterday, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  a lot of them bad hombres, one a Dominican who beat his pregnant wife to death in front of their kid. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=701.92s)]
*  He was popped in Boston, but Trump teams publicizing these raids to good effect. It's like cops, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  migrant edition running on loop and it's scaring the caravans into making U-turns. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=714.16s)]
*  Border crossings are plummeting. Look at that in a week, Trump slash Biden's border crossing [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  numbers by more than half. The border has gone quiet and Trump didn't need Congress to fix it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=725.28s)]
*  Just another one of those Biden lies. Marines are getting their hands dirty, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=731.28s)]
*  welding the border wall shut while the military plugs holes. ICE says they can finally do their [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  jobs. This is essentially like a unprecedented whole of government approach that we're [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=742.48s)]
*  experiencing. Some things that have been difficult to coordinate before because there's so many [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  different agencies, we've been able to get everybody in the same room and get kind of real time [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=752.48s)]
*  updates, real time intelligence and real time advice to make sure that we're doing this the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=757.12s)]
*  right way. It doesn't mean it's going to be easy. Yesterday, cartel gunmen gotten a shootout with [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=762.24s)]
*  U.S. Border Patrol while illegals were crossing a river. There hasn't been this much lead flying [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=767.6s)]
*  across the border since the Mexican-American war. Luckily, no one on our side was hit. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=772.96s)]
*  But securing the border is a dangerous operation. All the media wants to know is who's going to pick [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=778.72s)]
*  our crops? 42% of crop workers were undocumented immigrants and in many cases, as you know, these [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=784.96s)]
*  migrants do jobs many Americans do not want to do. Well, I'm sure it's not your position, Jake. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=792.72s)]
*  You're just asking the question that we should supply America's food with exploitative illegal [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  alien labor. I obviously don't think that's what you're implying. Only 1% of alien workers in the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  entire country work in agriculture. Those 30,000 legal aliens that Joe Biden dumped into Springfield. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=810.24s)]
*  I'm talking about the ones that are illegal. No, no, no, but I'm explaining this. It's [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=815.12s)]
*  important to understand. No, you're kind of changing the subject. I mean, I'm talking about the ones... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=818.32s)]
*  I will go, I will give me 30 minutes. I'll go as deep as you want to this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=822.0s)]
*  While Tapper worries whether he'll get his veggies, MSNBC [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=825.6s)]
*  thinks the only country that's ever deported anyone is Germany. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=829.2s)]
*  Hitler emerged emboldened after being imprisoned for staging a coup. His rage and xenophobia gained [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=834.0s)]
*  followers after the financial ruin of World War I and the Great Depression and helped get him selected [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=839.84s)]
*  as chancellor. Similarities to what happened in Germany and what's happening now in America [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=845.04s)]
*  are just undeniable. History may not repeat verbatim, but it sure does rhyme. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=850.0s)]
*  Can you still compare Trump to Hitler every night on TV? Is Comcast cool with that? Trump was almost [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  assassinated twice. By the way, Obama deported more people than any president in American history, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=861.7600000000001s)]
*  over a thousand a day for eight years. The media didn't call him Hitler. They praised him as the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=867.44s)]
*  deporter in chief. Barack gave Tom Homan a medal for deporting illegals. Now Democrats give medals [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=872.8s)]
*  for bringing them in. You know who should really get a medal? This guy on CNN. When kids start [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=879.76s)]
*  asking, why hasn't my best friend come back to school? Why is, you know, why didn't my friend [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=886.88s)]
*  disappear? When businesses start to shatter, when phone calls start happening. By the way, no amount [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=891.68s)]
*  of berating me about this is going to change the fact that the American people literally just [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=898.64s)]
*  voted for this. They want the criminals out. They want the violent people out. And there's really [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=903.84s)]
*  Democrats are going crazy over things in their imagination. There hasn't been a single raid at [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=912.72s)]
*  a school yet. And if Homan pulls an illegal gangbanger out of my daughter's school, the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=917.36s)]
*  correct response is thank you. And if my daughter was best friends with an illegal alien gangbanger, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  she's grounded and she's going to have to find new friends. While Democrats were focused on drag [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=930.16s)]
*  queens, reading stories to kindergartners, the rest of the country was like, ah guys, can you kick out [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=936.08s)]
*  MS-13 and lower the price of gasoline? Some Democrats are realizing they screwed up. The raging Cajun [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=940.72s)]
*  puts it all in the big guy's lap. It was a problem because president Biden listened to the idiot left [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=948.16s)]
*  and didn't enforce the border. Criminality of all kind should be dealt with and dealt with harshly. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=955.36s)]
*  And if there's anybody in this country illegally that's a criminal, they got to be sent back [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  wherever they came from. Voters want to change and Trump listened to them. What you're watching [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  is government working. I know we haven't seen this in a long time and no one's scared of getting [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=971.52s)]
*  canceled for using common sense. This is what government of the people, by the people and for [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=977.68s)]
*  the people looks like. Populism emerges when the establishment gets stuck, corrupt and stops listening. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  The eruption of radical change that we're witnessing is real and it's powerful. And it's why the powers [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=990.16s)]
*  that be tried so hard to stifle the rise of Trump. He was spied on and Pete shot at, arrested and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  sabotaged. And now that he's broken through, he's broken them and nothing is getting in the way. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1003.28s)]
*  As Politico says, quote, what we are witnessing is nothing short of a revolution inside the U.S. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1011.28s)]
*  government. Welcome to Hannity and tonight we do have a big announcement at the end of the show. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1018.24s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. I will be back in Washington D.C. tomorrow. All right, another busy day, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1028.88s)]
*  nonstop action from the Trump administration and the media mob spinning in circles. Predictably, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1034.0800000000002s)]
*  this as some of the worst people in the D.C. swamp are trying to derail Tulsi Gabbard's [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1040.8000000000002s)]
*  nomination as Donald Trump's director of national intelligence. Coming up, Megan McCain will join us. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1046.16s)]
*  She wants to defend Tulsi Gabbard from what has been a pretty disgraceful smear campaign. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  Let me just warn you, buckle up. All week it's going to be Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1057.6s)]
*  Cash Patel, and it will be one attempt after another to bork Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1063.52s)]
*  all of these nominees of President Trump. So don't be surprised. Also tonight, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1071.28s)]
*  my interview with Ukrainian President Zelensky. I asked if he would be open to a negotiated [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  settlement that takes NATO off the table and some compromise on territorial issues. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1081.28s)]
*  We'll tell you about his answer. I also asked him a question about whether or not Ukraine will pay [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1087.1999999999998s)]
*  the U.S. back the couple of hundred billion dollars that the U.S. has given them. But first, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1092.08s)]
*  today, after four long years, competency was restored to the White House press briefing room. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1097.76s)]
*  New White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, stood behind the podium for her very first [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1103.52s)]
*  official briefing. She wasted no time taking down members of the state-run legacy media mob. Take a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  look. President Trump has always been the hardest working man in politics. I think that's been [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1115.12s)]
*  proven over the past week. This president has again signed more than 300 executive orders. He's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1119.28s)]
*  taken historic action. I gaggle the board Air Force One to mark the first 100 days of this [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1125.12s)]
*  administration, 4 p.m. last Friday, our first hundred hours rather. And this president did [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1131.28s)]
*  more in the first hundred hours than the previous president did in the first 100 days. The past four [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  years, we've seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors. It's a big reason we've [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1140.8s)]
*  had an inflation crisis in this country. And it's incumbent upon this administration to make sure, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1145.28s)]
*  again, that every penny is being accounted for honestly. This administration is taking into [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1149.76s)]
*  consideration how hard the American people are working and their tax dollars actually matter to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1155.2s)]
*  this administration. Doge and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1160.72s)]
*  that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza. That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1166.16s)]
*  I would like to point out to each and every one of you that in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1172.16s)]
*  Office or upstairs in the residence sleeping, I'm not so sure, egg prices increased 65 percent [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1177.44s)]
*  in this country. I will say it's very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1184.48s)]
*  who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people. And that's [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  exactly what this administration is doing. It's correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1194.8s)]
*  four years. Many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room. I will [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1200.24s)]
*  not do that. But since you brought up truth seek, I would like to point out while I vowed to provide [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1204.96s)]
*  the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1210.56s)]
*  By the way, she absolutely crushed it. A little shock and awe for the mainstream media mob. What a [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  difference, by the way, a week makes. Clearly today, a star was born in that room. The previous [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1221.52s)]
*  administration, they used the press briefing room to peddle lies and misinformation and propaganda [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1227.44s)]
*  from a giant binder full of, you know, pre-written talking points. And of course, we're still waiting [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1232.56s)]
*  on Jen Psaki to circle back, especially on the egregious claim that the border is secure and closed [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  as millions and millions of unvetted Harris Biden, illegal immigrants poured across [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1246.08s)]
*  our borders right before our eyes. She flat out lied to us for years. Biden, Kamala, failed DHS [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1252.48s)]
*  secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas. They pushed this lie on you, the American people, while simultaneously [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1260.24s)]
*  allowing the greatest national security disaster in our nation's history to unfold. Thankfully, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1266.72s)]
*  there is a new sheriff in town and that is former governor, DHS secretary, Christy Noem. She'll join [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1272.8s)]
*  us in a moment. She is not messing around. And on just her second day on the job, she joined an [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1279.76s)]
*  illegal immigration raid in the Bronx and in New York City, writing on X, we are doing what President [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1286.8s)]
*  Trump promised the American people. We are making our streets safe. That is what real leadership [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1292.24s)]
*  looks like. Now throughout the morning, immigration officials, they partnered with federal law [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1298.32s)]
*  enforcement agencies to carry out all of these raids, arresting a number of criminal illegal [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1302.56s)]
*  aliens in our country. As the operation continued, secretary Noem posted several updates touting [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1308.72s)]
*  the capture of what she described as dirt bags among the numerous criminal illegal aliens arrested [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1315.6s)]

*  way into an apartment. The raids in New York City this morning are just the latest in the administration's [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1341.84s)]
*  nationwide crackdown in big cities and small towns all across the country. In fact, yesterday, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1347.92s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security put out a statement announcing 7,300 illegal aliens were [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1353.76s)]
*  arrested in Donald Trump's first week alone. As of 11 a.m., ICE said there had already been nearly 1,000 [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1360.72s)]
*  arrests made just this morning. President Trump reportedly wants at least 1,800 arrests every [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1368.96s)]
*  single day. With millions of millions here, that's a doable number. According to the press secretary, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1376.72s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, who we just played, Donald Trump is deadly serious about cleaning up the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1382.8s)]
*  illegal immigration disaster and the national security crisis that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  left behind. Take a look. President Trump has sent a loud and clear message to the entire world. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1393.52s)]
*  America will no longer tolerate illegal immigration. So to foreign nationals who are thinking about [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1400.72s)]
*  trying to illegally enter the United States, think again. Under this president, you will be detained [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  and you will be deported. Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1414.08s)]
*  that President Trump's administration is removing from our communities. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1429.2s)]
*  country illegally? All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  they are criminals as far as this administration goes. Checkmate, naturally. Not everybody's [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1437.36s)]
*  celebrating the Trump administration and their efforts to make our country safer. You know, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1443.04s)]
*  well, as per usual, reverting to form several members of the left-wing state-run legacy media [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1448.4s)]
*  mob. They are in a meltdown mode. What a shock. They've only been doing this for nine straight [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1455.3600000000001s)]
*  years. Take a look. When you start having Gestapo raids in America and we start becoming a country [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  where, as in East Germany, a knock on the door is the thing people are thinking about instead of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1470.16s)]
*  the brilliant idea they want to go create, then we are moving very, very far from the president [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1477.2s)]
*  worrying about what regular people need. He is distracting people with this flurry of activity, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1486.16s)]
*  but none of this, none of these images you're seeing are going to make your life better. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1491.28s)]
*  Similarities to what happened in Germany and what's happening now in America are just undeniable. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1495.3600000000001s)]
*  History may not repeat verbatim, but it sure does rhyme. An undocumented immigrant is not [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1501.44s)]
*  a criminal because he or she is undocumented. That is a civil offense. So to call people [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1506.96s)]
*  illegals is in and of itself, I think, xenophobic and racist. Now, that would be a criminal offense. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  Here we are. We're back to Gestapo and Hitler and Nazis and Stalin and Mussolini. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1521.76s)]
*  The hysteria, it never stops. No wonder why the state-run media mob is losing audience day by day. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1528.24s)]
*  They don't tell people the truth and the predictable comparisons to Hitler and Stalin, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1535.28s)]
*  it's on again and again and again. This is all they know. They don't know about truth. They don't, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1541.28s)]
*  they actually call themselves journalists. They're not the media mob. Clearly they learn nothing from [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1547.12s)]
*  November. They're not listening to the American people. They are doubling down on dumb, dumber, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1552.48s)]
*  and stupid. But it's not just the media. You have uninformed Hollywood celebrities also weighing in. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1558.08s)]
*  We saw yesterday Selena Gomez posting a video just sobbing uncontrollably about Donald Trump rounding [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1564.8s)]

*  five, Jocelyn Nungary, 13 years old, 12 years old, Lakin Riley? You know, what about the hundreds of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1578.72s)]
*  thousands of missing children, over 350,000? What about the hundreds of thousands of dead Americans [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  young people from fentanyl and opioids being trafficked over our southern border? What about [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1594.72s)]
*  the thousands of Americans murdered and raped and victims of other violent crimes by Harris, Biden, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1601.52s)]
*  Mayorkas, unvetted illegals? Where are those tears? I didn't see those tears from Selena or anyone in [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1608.56s)]
*  the state-run media mob that now is saying this is expensive to get rid of. What about the cost [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1616.0s)]
*  of feeding and housing and health care and education and free sex change operations funded [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1620.72s)]
*  by taxpayers that Kamala wanted? You know, where were the tears, you know, for the victims of crimes [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1627.3600000000001s)]
*  by these unvetted illegals? Instead, they're saving all their tears for criminal, illegal immigrants [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1634.08s)]
*  that didn't respect our laws, our borders, our sovereignty that are rightly being deported. They [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1640.0s)]
*  love to enforce the law when it comes to Donald Trump, even if it meant we're going to lie about [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  the value of Mar-a-Lago, we'll make up a story about Russia with Hillary's bought and paid for [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1650.24s)]
*  Russian dossier, we'll lie to FISA courts, we'll spy on a president, we'll have a double standard [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1655.2s)]
*  when it comes to top secret classified information. Where is their compassion for American victims? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1661.76s)]
*  And while the left is engaging in their theatrics, the Trump administration is on the ground, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1669.84s)]
*  some being shot at, making good on their promises to make this country safe again in small towns [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1675.76s)]
*  and big cities. And that includes DHS secretary Kristi Noem, take a look. We do have some challenges [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1683.04s)]
*  and the world is a dangerous place and we've got dangerous evil foreign governments that want to [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1690.8s)]
*  take us down. We will be the first line of defense for anybody that's in the American homeland. We [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1695.68s)]
*  will do everything that we can to protect the American people. Yeah, all right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1701.84s)]
*  I suppose that'll do. Happy Tuesday everyone. So angry newsman Jim Acosta announced on air [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1709.84s)]

*  Don Lemon. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1726.08s)]
*  The Trump White House has unveiled a new Twitter account to hold fake news accountable. It's called [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1731.52s)]
*  Rapid Response 47. Not to be confused with Rapid Response 46, which is how many times they called [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1736.56s)]
*  911 when they thought Joe was dead. President Trump has recently floated the idea of sending [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1743.36s)]
*  nearly 90,000 newly hired IRS agents to the border. The drug cartels welcome the news saying [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1752.0s)]
*  finally someone less popular than us. Illinois governor Jay Pritzker says he'll stand in the way [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1759.04s)]
*  of deportations that he feels break Illinois law. He also says he'll stand in the way of anyone who [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1768.32s)]
*  tries to cut in front of him at Sizzler. He's a big fat guy. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1775.2s)]
*  On his first day on the job, Secretary of Defense Pete Haggiseth declared no more DEI at the [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1786.0s)]
*  department. You're already seeing a big change. Instead of take your daughter to work day, you now [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1791.76s)]
*  have learned to kill people month. Trump has signed an executive order banning transgender [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1798.08s)]
*  troops from the military. They will be reassigned to the Bravo channel. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1805.76s)]
*  Such a gay channel. I can tell you don't watch. So with the help from the Taliban, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1814.48s)]
*  the Biden administration spent 15 million dollars to hand out contraceptives and condoms in [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1820.72s)]
*  Afghanistan. This after failing to convince the goats to go on the pill. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1826.24s)]
*  I knew that was coming. But I guess the Taliban is cool with condoms. I mean, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1835.6000000000001s)]
*  why would they take our advice on how to pull out? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  Wow, I know. John Fetterman drew outrage from the cast of The View for claiming Trump's New [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1846.0s)]
*  York hush money trial was politically motivated. I guess The View thought he was one of them [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1851.76s)]
*  because he also weighs 300 pounds. And finally, the CIA now says a lab leak is the most likely [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1857.04s)]
*  explanation for the COVID-19 pandemic. Great news for lovers of bat soup. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1865.6s)]
*  All right, let's do a monologue. Okay, Greg. So it seems like the Trump-led Republican party is [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1873.12s)]
*  kicking ass and taking names. I haven't seen this many changes since puberty. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1879.36s)]
*  Now, I know this is the part where I'm supposed to say all politics is cyclical, that the Dems [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1884.7199999999998s)]
*  are going to come back storming in the midterms. And it could be true, of course. But it's also [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1888.7199999999998s)]
*  possible that in a game of one-on-one, I could dunk on Barron Trump. But you know, that's not true. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1893.1999999999998s)]
*  Right now, the Dems are lost, wandering in the political wilderness like Joe Biden in the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1899.84s)]
*  rainforest. Maybe we could turn that into a reality TV show called Naked and Afraid of the Truth. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1904.0s)]
*  They're like a bunch of California politicians standing around watching the houses burn. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1914.96s)]
*  No plan, no leadership, nobody to tell them what to do. So what's left when you're left with the [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1920.16s)]
*  one tool that your elites taught you? Well, you get this cover story from New York Magazine that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1925.44s)]
*  bashes young righties titled The Cruel Kids Table. Because, of course, for the left, it always goes [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1930.72s)]
*  back to the cafeteria in high school. And it takes the new MAGA generation to task for being happy, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1936.88s)]
*  hopeful, and so-called normal. But in the piece, the writer paints them as creepy, white, and racist. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1943.44s)]
*  Especially white. As white as Steve Doocy at a nude beach. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1950.96s)]
*  But the writer, Brock Colyar, couldn't rely on facts for that observation. The rag had a resort to some heavy-handed photo edits in which the magazine reviews blacks from the cover photo and the party. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1954.8s)]
*  The writer even quotes a partygoer without mentioning that person's race. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1970.0s)]
*  He could have, but then there goes your byline. It's no cover story if it's black and white. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1974.8s)]
*  But according to young black conservative C.J. Pearson, who actually hosted the event, there were black partyers there that the magazine either cropped out or carefully avoided for its cover photo. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1980.8s)]
*  That must have been awkward, you know, asking the blacks to move out of the photo because they're ruining your narrative. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1990.72s)]
*  They're real, they're like a really specific wedding photographer. Just the bridesmaid. Now just the parents. Now just the white people. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=1997.36s)]
*  So who are the racists now, bitches? Of course this ain't new, it's just another retread of an old attack. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2007.68s)]
*  But it's even more pointless because no one is buying it anymore. This beast has been slayed. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2014.4s)]
*  So why are they still playing this tune long after the song died? It's too easy to say because they have nothing else. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  Because this time it's different. Sure, you could always pick any issue and it would be the same. Crime, immigration, social events. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2026.48s)]
*  Underneath it, it's always going to be the racism. But now there's a helplessness to it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2033.76s)]
*  And the helplessness is due to a total reliance on outside forces telling you what to think. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2039.6s)]
*  And now that outside force has been decapitated. That voice that told them Trump was Hitler or men could shower with girls or Taylor Swift was a six when you know she's a five. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2046.0s)]
*  That voice has vanished. The progressive bat signal has been turned off. And writers like Brock, they're on their own. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2057.04s)]
*  When no one is giving them marching orders, they run around like non-binary chickens with their d*** cut off. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2067.04s)]
*  And so they pretend to report but wonder bitterly why everyone else seems so different from them. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2073.04s)]
*  And by different, I mean free and happy because they're thinking for themselves. Look at that cover. The people that the left hates. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2080.56s)]
*  They look awesome and most of all fearless. You can bet they aren't looking over their shoulders for cancel cops. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2088.16s)]
*  Hell, they even invited one to the party, the writer from New York magazine. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2094.56s)]
*  So in these happy faces, you see people who weren't waiting for a bat signal. They weren't slaves to the external voice. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  The fear of social stigma unleashed online by a tiny group of unstable shut-ins who claim to be journalists. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2106.56s)]
*  All this Trump energy is fueled by that repudiation. Trump freed America from the slavery of paralyzing groupthink, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2112.96s)]
*  which was the empty sad life that the elites exploited for status and wealth. That woke ism, the fear of the smear. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2120.64s)]
*  And now it's all gone. And all you have are the pathetic few who wait for their marching orders from somewhere, anywhere. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2127.6s)]
*  Please. Meanwhile, the rest of the world parties on and you could bet they aren't thinking of you, dear writer. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2134.08s)]
*  And that's what hurts most. When you make your life about identity, it hurts that no one cares. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2141.12s)]
*  As everyone realizes you have nothing else and you become a party of one. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2146.64s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. She's like a ray of sunshine, bright, warm and loved by nudists. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2153.2799999999997s)]
*  Co-host of Outnumbered, Emily Campagno. He's got more faces than a watch factory. Actor and comedian Jim Brewer. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2161.36s)]
*  Her mood changes are as drastic as her pants are temporarily elastic. New York Times bestselling [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2173.2000000000003s)]
*  author and Fox News contributor, Kat Thib. He's like bingo because old women love to shout his name. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2178.96s)]
*  New York Times bestselling, author, comedian, former NWF. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2188.0s)]
*  Emily, I'm fascinated by the reaction to every issue and problem from the Dems because they seem [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2194.72s)]
*  headless. And so the reactions seem like they're from a dying world. What say you, Emily? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2201.68s)]
*  Yes, it's almost like when you watch those sci-fi movies and you know, the cyborg in charge and you [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2208.88s)]
*  shoot the arrow and you kill the thing in the middle and all of a sudden the millions of robots [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2214.72s)]
*  don't know what to do before they all fall down. And I see it the most, I think, with the dismantling [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  of the federal government of the bloat. What I love the most actually is the IRS agent thing going [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2223.6s)]
*  to the border because to me that's sort of emblematic of the entire thing happening, this shift, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  this freedom from groupthink that everyone was paralyzed from. It permeated our government. And [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2234.16s)]
*  reminder that the IRS spent your tax dollars to the tune of 35 million on military-style weapons [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2239.36s)]
*  and artillery and military gear. Why in the f*** do IRS agents coming after your money need to have [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2247.04s)]
*  military-style weapons? Because they're stealing it. Because they're stealing it. 10 million of that in the last five years. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  So the fact that now it's like, oh okay, you want to play Rambo? I've seen firsthand them show up in [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2261.84s)]
*  pairs of two around the country to claw back your income that they thought was theirs. Go ahead then, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2266.64s)]
*  play Rambo at the border. Play Rambo where it really matters, which is protecting Americans, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2271.92s)]
*  not from you, but from actual threats. So I love the fact that regardless that the Dems actually [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2276.4s)]
*  sort of resurrect themselves and come back in some kind of force, if they find anyone that's [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2282.4s)]
*  actually articulate or intelligent enough to lead them, there's not going to be anything left to [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2286.16s)]
*  The destruction that Trump is doing, he is totally freeing everyone and it includes us from the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2292.0s)]
*  government's bureaucratic hold, top down from every agency. And that is something that they will never [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2297.76s)]
*  recover from because it means Americans will maintain that freedom. Wow, all right, Emily. Ladies and gentlemen. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2304.4s)]
*  Wow. You know, Jim, before Trump came in, you had no problem speaking your mind. You had no [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2313.6800000000003s)]
*  problems sharing the risk with other people. Do you envision the people that were around you that [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2320.64s)]
*  didn't do the same thing will suddenly come around? Are you noticing now? Oh, they're all coming out. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2326.08s)]
*  Yes, they're all coming out. They got their skates on. I'm so sorry. Got a couple of those. Yes. I just [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2331.04s)]
*  want to say I never meant to insult voters, Trump voters. I don't like him. I have a MAGA hat right here. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2338.56s)]
*  No, no, no. Oh yeah, they're all starting to, they're all starting to come from the groundwork. But on a [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2350.72s)]
*  different note, did your husband ever win any arguments? Wow. I mean, I would not, you better be prepared [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  showing up for Emily. I bet she, she just got married so the guy probably doesn't realize what he's in for. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2369.12s)]
*  Oh boy. Really? He had no idea what he was in for? Could you imagine her vows? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2376.08s)]
*  They would be fast, that's for sure. That's awesome. Did you start them going, you guys. And legally binding. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2390.08s)]
*  Kat, do you see what I see, this kind of like incredible, it's like an opportunity, but it seems [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2396.88s)]
*  like it's hopeless. Like what is over on that other world of the Democrat party that, did you read this [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2403.2s)]
*  article? I did. What did you make of it? So I think that there's a lot of reasons maybe to dump on the writer. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2409.68s)]
*  I think that one of the reasons, I do feel bad for the writer for one thing, which is the writer did [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  not select that photo. That just cropped all the black people out. Yeah, true. But you know, they went [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2420.56s)]
*  there, I thought it was an interesting read because it is a very different thing to be around and [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2428.32s)]
*  apparently, but really what he was just describing was mostly somebody who was around, he was around [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2433.6000000000004s)]
*  jokes that were not politically correct. Right. From people who were by and large, I assume, intoxicated. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2441.36s)]
*  Yes. Hanging out in a bar while people are being like rude. They're at the ball, right? So I'm sure, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2446.48s)]
*  I mean, to me, that's, you can go to any bar and kind of hear those sorts of things, I would think [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2453.6s)]
*  in most places. But I want to know, I wasn't invited to the ball. No. Were you invited to any of the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2458.4s)]
*  balls? No, I wasn't. I was ball-less. Were you invited to any of the balls? Yeah. You were? I was not invited. I was invited to a bunch of them, but they had a dress code. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2464.08s)]
*  I was not. Now, I would not have gone, but still. You would have liked to have been invited to the balls. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2470.96s)]
*  I got to, I was in bed eating snacks in the hotel. I'm not allowed to do that at home. Yeah, I do that a lot too. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, Tyrus, it does feel like there are only a few left that are still going to push the race card [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2483.8399999999997s)]
*  and the Nazi card, the Hitler card. Until they make one. Yeah. You speak the devil's name [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2490.64s)]
*  enough, eventually he appears. When you hear these people who have these platforms that are unchecked, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  that can go on TV every night and say he's Hitler and he's this, somewhere there's a disturbed [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2505.2799999999997s)]
*  individual who's absorbing this, who's seeing the attention, the fame. I mean, we just had a guy [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2511.36s)]
*  shoot somebody in the back and he was a hero. Yeah. So they continue to feed this fire because they just need one. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2518.32s)]
*  And if that one just happens to have a MAGA hat on backwards, then it was all right. It was all for not. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2525.76s)]
*  So while they're censoring and they're saying he's Hitler, you keep saying Hitler enough, you're going [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  to make one. And that's why these networks see it. Why they don't see that. Why do not? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2538.4s)]
*  If we sat on this network every night and said that Kamala Harris was a vampire and we just kept [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  doing it, well, she was drinking something red and we just kept doing that and we kept, she was not [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  real. She was not this earth. She had no soul. We would all be out of jobs and be like, that's a crazy [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2555.92s)]
*  way of talking about another human being. Well, I've said that about Joe. I believe that. And the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2560.8s)]
*  other thing about the article real quick, what that person saw was what people do who don't go [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2565.36s)]
*  out like this. Hey, out with my friends. Yes. Having drinks. No, they were at the bar being an adult, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2571.6s)]
*  saying adult things. You will hear all kinds of my mouth with a beer and my buddies that you would [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2577.1200000000003s)]
*  not. And if someone brought a camera out, that individual will be thrown out the bar. Right. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2582.48s)]
*  Because you're trying to have a good time. Yeah. Also there's this aspect of, I'm sure a lot of [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2586.8s)]
*  people wanted to show off in front of the reporter to some extent. I mean, it's like a different [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2590.56s)]
*  variation of girls gone wild. Yes. It's like, watch me use the word retard. You notice before the cameras, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2595.6s)]
*  the girls boobs were in their shirts. Yes. Yeah. There you go. All right. Up next, he went from the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmxl8jzrqw&t=2601.52s)]
