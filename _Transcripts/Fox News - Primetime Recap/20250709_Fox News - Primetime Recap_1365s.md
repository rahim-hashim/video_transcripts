# Fox News Highlights - July 8, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8)
*  Good evening everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert. DOJ sources are telling Fox News Digital that former CIA Director [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=3.6s)]
*  John Brennan and former FBI Director Jim Comey are now both under criminal investigation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=9.76s)]
*  What would be for potential wrongdoing related to the Trump-Russia probe? We have more on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=16.48s)]
*  this later. But first, ambushing America. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=21.44s)]
*  The eyes always tell the story. These are the suspects arrested and charged with attempted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=30.56s)]
*  murder of a federal law enforcement officer after they spent their Fourth of July allegedly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=37.6s)]
*  ambushing officers at the Prairie Land ICE Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=42.72s)]
*  This was part of an organized attack. It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Corrections officers. Make no mistake, this was not a so-called peaceful protest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=55.12s)]
*  It was indeed an ambush. Tonight we're getting stunning new details about how they did it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=62.48s)]
*  They were clad in black tactical gear. The complaint says the group lured DHS Corrections [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=68.88s)]
*  officers outside by shooting fireworks at the detention center building. So agents called 911 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=73.92s)]
*  and then they went outside to investigate and talk to the suspects. A few minutes later, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=81.76s)]
*  an Alvarado police officer arrived on the scene. The moment he stepped out of the car, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  a gunman who was hidden in the woods opened fire, struck him in the neck. At the exact same time, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=92.4s)]
*  another gunman started shooting at the DHS officers. 20 to 30 rounds from an AR-15 style [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  rifle were shot. Those officers are all blessed to be alive tonight. A jammed AR-style rifle was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=106.32s)]
*  found at the scene. Now imagine how many could have been murdered. So what motivated these suspects [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  like Cameron Arnold of Dallas, Texas, aka Autumn Hill, or Savannah Batten of Fort Worth, Texas? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  She was previously arrested for obstructing a highway during another deportation protest [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=131.04s)]
*  back in 2018. Then there's Nathan Baumann. Look at his eyes. College station, Texas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=135.76s)]
*  Per the complaint, he was carrying spray paint and flyers saying, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  fight ICE terror with class war and free all political prisoners. Then there's Zachary Evitz [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=146.72s)]
*  of Waxahachie, Texas. Per the complaint, Evitz's car was spotted fleeing the scene with other [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  suspects in it. He was later found walking along the road about three miles from the ICE facility. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=159.92s)]
*  Police searched him and they found a black balaclava, a mask, a pair of tactical style gloves, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  and a pair of safety goggles. An officer asked Evitz where he was coming from and he said, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=171.68s)]
*  I do not know, or words to that effect. Then there's Joy Gibson of Dallas, Texas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  The complaint says that she had two cell phones in the backpack inside a Faraday bag, which is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=184.24s)]
*  used to prevent law enforcement from tracking location information. Then there's Bradford Morris [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=190.72s)]
*  of Dallas, AKA Megan Morris. Per the complaint, Morris's house was used as a staging location [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=197.44s)]
*  before the ambush. Police recovered nine additional firearms, three body armor vests, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=206.64s)]
*  cans of spray paint, and fireworks. Then Elizabeth Soto in Inez Soto, both of Fort Worth, Texas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=212.8s)]
*  There's Marcella Rueda, also from Fort Worth, and Seth Sykes of Cannondale, Texas. They were found [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=221.44s)]
*  after fleeing the scene with a few other suspects that I mentioned earlier. Now the complaint says [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  they were all dressed in this black military style clothing, like make-believe soldiers. Some had body [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=233.84s)]
*  armor, some covered in mud, some armed, some had a banner found by one of the officers that read [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=239.12s)]
*  resist fascism. And this is the favorite, fight the oligarchy. Now where have we heard that before? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=244.72s)]
*  This fascist administration didn't come from anywhere. They have planted the seeds for years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=254.8s)]
*  We've got to defeat the oligarchs and the dictators that are trying to take over our country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=260.56s)]
*  Do we have the guts to stand up to Trumpism and oligarchy and authoritarianism? We say yes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=266.4s)]
*  And tonight I say all of them have blood on their hands and shame on Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  for not getting their members under control. Those demented fake soldiers who were arrested, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  dressed in that tactical gear they probably ordered on Amazon, probably don't even know the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  meaning of oligarchy. They probably, I'm certain they don't know the real history of fascism. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=294.64s)]
*  But it's reasonable to conclude, is it not, that they feel obligated, maybe even entitled, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=299.44s)]
*  to get violent, even to commit murder because they're acting on unofficial implied orders. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=305.28s)]
*  The rhetoric has to stop. They're simply enforcing law that Congress enacted. So for Congress to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=313.68s)]
*  attack them, to force them to the laws they wrote, it's just, it's ridiculous. It's going to end in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=318.56s)]
*  bloodshed. I think there'll be more bloodshed. Now this is the second ambush in only four days [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=322.88s)]
*  in Texas. In McAllen, it ended with the assailant being taken down, another deranged anarchist soaked [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=328.24s)]
*  in online violence. He spent a lot of time on Call of Duty, a video game, and one of the people [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=334.56s)]
*  that's in that game is an anarchist. He was playing the anarchist. What he had spray-painted on his [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=340.4s)]
*  spray-painted car was associated with that. So this is a plan he had. He has a plan with the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  co-morbidity agents. And today, another suspect, 43-year-old Matthew White, he was arrested in New [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=349.44s)]
*  York after posting multiple specific online threats against immigration officials, including [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=356.88s)]
*  against an ICE official in Virginia. And get this, and against his children. I'm not going to read [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=363.6s)]
*  this sicko's threat, but it's on the screen. Now for years, Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=370.96s)]
*  the squad, all of them railed about Charlottesville and tiki torches and veins bulging on [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=381.2s)]
*  foreheads. Democrats in the media painted anyone, and I mean anyone, who showed up for Trump on [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  January 6 as a terrorist, just rot in jail. So where are those same people now? Where are the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=395.2s)]
*  Democrats? Where's the chorus of condemnations? Where is the demand by leadership to tamp down [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=402.0s)]
*  on this rhetoric? Why are they not holding press conferences to distance themselves from the hate [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=407.68s)]
*  speech and the hateful actions, the violence that they claim to care so much about? The truth is, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=413.2s)]
*  the eyes of these fanatics, the actions of these domestic terrorists, are 100% inspired by false [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=420.96s)]
*  narratives peddled by the press and Democrats at all levels of government. This is an ambush, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=429.2s)]
*  not just of ICE, but of America, because part of their plan, this is just a small step toward that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  plan, is to try to dismantle the country we all love. And sometimes the anarchists are stupid [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  enough to speak the quiet part out loud, like former University of Minnesota professor Melanie [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=448.64s)]
*  Yazzie. Help to lead that to be the tip of the spear here of all liberation struggles in the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=454.0s)]
*  movements that seek to seek a world of justice, equality, and peace, that seek to dismantle the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=460.24s)]
*  United States. I hope you seek to dismantle the United States, and if that isn't your politics, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=466.08s)]
*  okay. That's psycho. I'll let that sink in. They will not stop [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=470.96s)]
*  ambushing ICE and Border Patrol because they intend to ambush America. And that's the angle. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=478.32s)]
*  Democrats say there needs to be bloodshed to get attention, so now they're building underground [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=487.44s)]
*  labs and putting their foot soldiers through boot camp. I've started something called resistance [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=492.4s)]
*  lab. It's a training on really the documented most effective ways to counter democratic [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=498.48s)]
*  backsliding, nonviolent resistance tactics to build that movement. A couple of months ago, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  Mad Maxine Waters, no relation, said Republicans were training up in the hills, but it's Democrats [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=512.24s)]
*  who are working out in labs. Dozed USAID staff are building a network and plotting rebellions [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=518.16s)]
*  and nationwide strikes. Reports say they've been passing out old CIA pamphlets titled [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=525.12s)]
*  simple sabotage. The strategy is to harass and demoralize the enemy. Prime time went inside one [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=531.36s)]
*  of these resistance labs and General Jayapal is whipping her army into shape. Governments and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=537.76s)]
*  institutions together do not save people from dictators. The thing that saves people from [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=544.32s)]
*  dictators is the people. It is large scale mass movements of people. If you have the moral high [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=550.72s)]
*  ground and you act with dignity, then anger is incredibly compelling and people will join you. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=558.96s)]
*  We're getting reports that the Abrams tank is flanking in from the south. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=566.0s)]
*  You send the U.S. Marines into spaces they should not be. You send the National Guard in. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=571.2s)]
*  Kidnap people off the streets and pretend that's normal. That's how you quiet dissent. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=576.8s)]
*  You make everyone afraid if they don't do what you want, they might be next. Once you've done [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=582.0s)]
*  those nine steps, step ten is easy. That's when you decide there won't be new elections because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=586.64s)]
*  everyone is either afraid, poor, broken, or complicit. Stacey says Trump deporting bad [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=590.88s)]
*  hombres means we're never going to have another election. Democrats are acting like it's do or die [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=597.1199999999999s)]
*  and they're on a war path. A Democrat running for city council in San Antonio just took out a hit, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=602.88s)]
*  quote, I want to see a few dead ICE agents in Los Angeles. Don't let me down. Radicals are already [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=609.04s)]
*  answering his call. A New York man was just arrested for threatening to murder an ICE agent [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=616.0s)]
*  and his kids. After an ICE sting in Virginia, he says this, I can't wait to put a bullet into [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=621.28s)]
*  this guy's brain. But first, his children. 43-year-old Matthew White also posted things like [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=626.88s)]
*  kill them all. ICE is the new age Gestapo. Stop them. And told home, and if your ICE agents don't [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=633.68s)]
*  show proof of identity and a signed warrant, we will kill them. Over 24 hours ago, a gunman [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=640.4s)]
*  opened fire on a border patrol facility in Texas. The Justice Department calls it an organized [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=646.56s)]
*  tactical ambush and Bondi's crew just hit these wannabe assassins hard. Today, my office has [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=651.92s)]
*  charged 10 individuals with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer. It was [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers. Make no mistake. This was [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=665.36s)]
*  not a so-called peaceful protest. It was indeed an ambush. We have the mugshots. Look at that. Big [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=673.28s)]
*  surprise. Two of them are trans. One of them, a dude named Cameron, wants to be called Autumn Hill. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=680.88s)]
*  Okay, Autumn. Miss Autumn pulled up with her gang, draped in black military style clothing, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=688.4s)]
*  and fired off dozens of rounds. One of them was across the street and fired up the 30 rounds at [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=693.92s)]
*  officers outside the facility. And they had fight ICE terror with class war and free all political [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=699.36s)]
*  prisoners spray painted on their flyers. Oh, and fight oligarchy and ICE pigs were spray painted on [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=706.0s)]
*  cars. And that's not all. In California today, ICE agents tried to booby trap a border patrol vehicle [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=712.16s)]
*  and blow out its tires. No one got hurt, but four people were arrested. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=718.64s)]
*  Homan says it's only a matter of time. I said over two months ago, if the rhetoric continues [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=723.28s)]
*  against ICE agents and border patrol agents about being compared to terrorists like Congressman Jay [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=729.52s)]
*  Paul did, being compared to Nazis and racists, that it's going to end with the use of force that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=734.8s)]
*  either a criminal is going to die or an officer is going to die. I've seen this recipe before. I knew [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=740.88s)]
*  it's coming and I don't think it's over. Assaults on ICE agents are already up 700 percent and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=746.0s)]
*  Democrats want it to get even worse. Remember the senator who lunged at Kristi Noem? He's proposing a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=751.76s)]
*  bill that would unmask ICE agents. They want masks banned and officers to show ID before they bust a bad guy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=757.6s)]
*  Not show ID to vote. You have to show ID to arrest MS-13. And it's the first time they've ever wanted [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=766.32s)]
*  to ban masks. Mayors in blue cities say they're leaving ICE in the dust. This administration, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=772.72s)]
*  the Trump administration, has caused so much consternation and division. Look, we are welcoming [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=779.44s)]
*  city ordinance. Our local police department will not ever cooperate with ICE. Democrats claim they [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=785.04s)]
*  want to deport the worst first, but their sanctuary cities won't cooperate with ICE. So as Biden would [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  say, it's just malarkey. Karen Bass yesterday told ICE to beat it. The border patrol chief said, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=803.12s)]
*  no bueno. The federal government is not leaving LA. I don't work for Karen Bass. The federal [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  government doesn't work for Karen Bass. We're going to be here till that mission is accomplished, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=815.6s)]
*  as I said, and better get used to us now because this is going to be normal very soon. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Karen's fighting ICE harder than she fights fires. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get used to it because last I checked, I was elected to be [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=832.48s)]
*  mayor of the city. That did not include a federal takeover. So either you believe in democracy or [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=836.88s)]
*  you don't. Who's going to tell Karen that the federal government trumps the mayor? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=842.72s)]
*  Bass and every liberal mayor can tie themselves to the train tracks, but it's not stopping Homan. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=847.76s)]
*  He's got a sweet tooth for deportations and there isn't anywhere he won't go. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=854.08s)]
*  We're going to double down and triple down the sanctuary cities. If we can't arrest a bad guy [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=859.92s)]
*  in the jail, then we'll go to community and we'll find him or we'll do more worksite enforcement. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=863.92s)]
*  We'll find him at the worksite. And when we do these things and we ramp up that enforcement, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=868.64s)]
*  we're going to find others, others who aren't a criminal target, but they're in the country [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  illegally. We're going to arrest them too. So what you're going to get sanctuary cities is exactly [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=876.0s)]
*  what you don't want. More agents in your communities and more collateral arrests. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  Migrant gangs are going buck wild in inner cities and Democrats want them to lay down roots. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=885.1999999999999s)]
*  Not even Mexico wants these guys over the weekend. They rioted in Mexico city over open borders. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=890.24s)]
*  Even Mexicans are telling illegals to get out. Is it racist when Mexicans want to ice illegals? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=897.36s)]
*  The New York Times is even admitting we have a migrant gang problem. After calling the Venezuelan [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=903.76s)]
*  gangs who took over Aurora, Colorado, a false story. Now the Times is saying Democrats denied [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=909.12s)]
*  this city had a gang problem, but the truth is complicated. Democrats are dying alone on this [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=914.96s)]
*  hill. They're building resistance labs, shooting at ICE agents and deep staters are using CIA [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=921.52s)]
*  tactics to sabotage Trump. Who else knows what's up their sleeves? They've rioted, firebombed cars [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=927.76s)]
*  and shot Trump in the head. The Daily Caller reports USAID sent thousands of viruses to a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=935.2s)]
*  bio lab in Wuhan linked to the Chinese military and they did it for 10 years. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=943.76s)]
*  If the labs or viruses don't work, there's always voodoo dolls. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=951.76s)]
*  Yeah, hot enough for you. I don't mean the weather. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=956.8s)]
*  I don't know what that means. Good evening everyone. So according to a new book, Joe Biden [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=962.96s)]
*  didn't know how many hours he spent with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Even worse, when he met Xi, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=967.04s)]
*  he handed him a bag of laundry. Honest mistake. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=973.12s)]
*  Former Biden aides reportedly changed Joe's number after a New York Times journalist called [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=983.76s)]
*  his personal cell phone. Those who tried to reach Joe were met with a Verizon recording that said, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=989.04s)]
*  the president you dialed is no longer in service. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=994.32s)]
*  Democrat voters are reportedly telling politicians they need to be violent [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=997.84s)]
*  in resisting Trump and lawmakers should be, should prepare to get shot. Or depending on [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1001.52s)]
*  the lawmaker, stabbed through the heart with a wooden stake. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1008.24s)]
*  Dipped in holy water. A man in Italy reportedly committed suicide by getting sucked into a jet [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1015.44s)]
*  engine. After hearing the news, guess who just bought her husband a jet? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1021.12s)]
*  House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries is being mocked for posting a bad Photoshop [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1031.52s)]
*  to make himself look thinner. Because here he is in real life. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1035.6s)]
*  According to the Daily Mail, women are improving their sex drives by taking pills [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1044.08s)]
*  made from the fallopian tubes of cows. Yeah, thankfully though, the cows don't seem to miss it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1048.96s)]
*  Never get enough. According to software company Nordpass, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1061.04s)]
*  the most common password in the world is 123456. In a related story, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  guess who just emptied Brian Kilmeade's 401k account? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1073.92s)]
*  And I think this is finally, I'm not sure. A 33 year old Chinese man who showed up at the ER [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1078.96s)]
*  with severe stomach pains turned out to have a foot long live eel in his abdomen. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1089.44s)]
*  Wow, how did he get that in there? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1098.56s)]
*  So monologue time. House Democrats are claiming that their base is so angry that they're demanding [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1108.96s)]
*  a disregard for American institutions, even the rule of law. One voter even wanted Democrat [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1121.28s)]
*  lawmakers to be willing to get shot when visiting ICE facilities. Finally something we can all agree [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1127.04s)]
*  on. Kid. But that's how you know when your party's f***ed. When you hope your leaders get lead [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1134.72s)]
*  poisoning. One lawmaker said their own base thinks resistance to Trump is so futile that [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1142.48s)]
*  there needs to be blood. And they're tired of waiting for Tim Walz's time of the month. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1148.48s)]
*  So after years of lies from Trump is Hitler to Jasmine Crockett can read, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1157.2s)]
*  they've worked themselves into a frenzy saying Trump's got to be stopped by force. So as if given [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1162.0s)]
*  orders from above, a gunman in tactical gear opened fire on border patrol agents in Texas. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  Agents return fire and the shooter is deader than the elastic in Jerry Nadler's underpants. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1174.72s)]
*  But a local police officer was hit and is in stable condition. Democrats say we won't know [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  a motive unless of course we find out he's Republican. Meanwhile, 10 people now face [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1187.6s)]

*  officers. There up to 12 people in black military style clothing began shooting fireworks at the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1199.36s)]
*  facility. In Portland on Friday, anti-ICE protests ended ugly as protesters clashed with officers. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1205.04s)]
*  Of course, this year we've seen Teslas burned after the Dems made Elon the new Hitler. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1211.76s)]
*  In LA, Dems turned a blind eye as cars were torched and concrete was hurled onto police [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1216.48s)]
*  cars on the freeway. Instead, they called on ICE agents to remove their masks when they should [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1221.2s)]
*  be asking Nancy Pelosi to keep hers on. But storming a New Jersey ICE facility, crashing a news [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1228.0s)]
*  conference, or throwing rocks at ICE vans, just another day for the party. Luckily, a lot of them [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1236.48s)]
*  throw like bitches. So what's the Dem leadership doing? Well, here's Hakeem Jeffries, the House [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1242.64s)]
*  minority leader, posing with a baseball bat, vowing to push back against Trump's legislation. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1250.16s)]
*  Well, that's one player they'll never have to test for steroids. Hakeem posing with a baseball bat [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1255.92s)]
*  is about as believable as AOC posing at the library. But you'd think the Dems would have [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1262.4s)]
*  learned after Trump's near assassinations that demonization can lead to death. Or maybe that is [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1268.8000000000002s)]
*  the lesson they learned and they liked it. And if your party's a failed institution, why not bring [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1275.52s)]
*  on the violence? So imagine you're one of America's enemies. You've got to be thrilled with your 10-year [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1280.48s)]
*  plan to destroy America. It's right on schedule. First, you radicalize the segment of society, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1285.8400000000001s)]
*  exploiting the egos of elite campus activists. Then you made the idea of a border, a toxic symptom [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1291.6s)]
*  of Western imperialism. You created a mass invasion, flooding the country with millions of unknowns. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1298.7199999999998s)]

*  I don't think any of our global enemies could have pulled this one off. I bet they're wondering who [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1309.76s)]

*  will always be better armed and better at using those arms. But unlike the left, we don't see [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1320.56s)]
*  violence as an acceptable political remedy. It's why the only gun used on Jan 6th was by a Democrat [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1325.84s)]
*  cop on an unarmed protester. Fact is, the left views everything as a power struggle between [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1332.56s)]
*  oppressed and oppressor. And they believe there are no limits when fighting the oppressor. So the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1338.24s)]
*  Dems were right when they warned about threats against democracy and political violence. They [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1343.36s)]
*  just didn't say it was coming from them. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTP1L03XO8&t=1349.44s)]
