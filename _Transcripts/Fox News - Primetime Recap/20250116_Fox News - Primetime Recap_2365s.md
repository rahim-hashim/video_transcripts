# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 15, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw)
*  All right, Democrats love to claim that Republicans are stuck in the past. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=0.0s)]
*  But today at Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing, that old fossil Dick Durbin dragged us back [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=7.12s)]
*  to 2020, and she handled him masterfully. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=12.58s)]
*  Do you have any doubts that Joe Biden had the majority of votes, electoral votes necessary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=17.04s)]
*  to be elected president in 2020? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=21.84s)]
*  You know, Senator, all I can tell you as a prosecutor is from my firsthand experience. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=23.96s)]
*  And I accept the results. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=30.44s)]
*  I accept, of course, that Joe Biden is president of the United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=32.18s)]
*  But what I can tell you is what I saw firsthand when I went to Pennsylvania as an advocate [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  for the campaign. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=42.36s)]
*  I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania, and I saw [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  many things there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  But do I accept the results? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=50.2s)]
*  Of course I do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=51.74s)]
*  Do I agree with what happened? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=52.74s)]
*  And I saw so much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=54.300000000000004s)]
*  You know, no one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=57.82s)]
*  integrity in our country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=64.14s)]
*  We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the laws to be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=67.68s)]
*  followed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=73.9s)]
*  I need to get glasses like that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=74.9s)]
*  Hear, hear, Pam. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=77.14s)]
*  Mel Durbin, of course, didn't lay a glove on her, and neither did the other anti-Trump [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  grumps who seem to be speaking to the cheap seats at MSNBC. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you, sitting here today, whether you are aware of a factual predicate to investigate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=87.84s)]
*  Liz Cheney. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=92.68s)]
*  Senator, no one has asked me to investigate Liz Cheney. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=93.68s)]
*  We're also worried about Liz Cheney, Senator. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=96.92s)]
*  You know what we should be worried about? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Ms. Bonney, please answer my questions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=101.0s)]
*  The primary in California right now is the roof. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=103.0s)]
*  Your robberies are 87 percent higher than the national average. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=105.96s)]
*  That's what I want to be focused on, Senator, if I'm confirmed as attorney general. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=110.86s)]
*  Does Adam Schiff really think that Americans lie awake at night worrying, fretting about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=117.13999999999999s)]
*  the fate of Liz Cheney? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  Talk about out of touch. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=126.0s)]
*  This was a six-hour exercise in liberal futility. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  It was like an extended campaign commercial for the GOP. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=131.28s)]
*  Senator, what circumstances will you prosecute journalists for what they write? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=135.14s)]
*  Is President-elect Trump eligible to run for another term as president in 2028? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  Can you say no to the president of the United States when he asks you to do something unethical [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  or illegal? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=153.48s)]
*  It's like the Muppets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=154.48s)]
*  They still can't quit their Trump's a threat to democracy obsession. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  It blew up in their faces on election day, but I guess they just got nothing else. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  Senator after senator sounded like they just ripped the pages out of Kamala's old debate [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=167.5s)]
*  prep. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=171.94s)]
*  He has also said illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  He said that in December 2023. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=179.66000000000003s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  Senator, I am not familiar with that statement, but what I can tell you is I went to the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=184.74s)]
*  border a few months ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=190.46s)]
*  I went to Yuma, Arizona, and what I saw at that border was horrific, senator. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=192.3s)]
*  It was horrific. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=198.78s)]
*  I went to a rape crisis center. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=199.78s)]
*  I went to a rape crisis center. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm not familiar with the statement, but I went to a rape crisis center. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=205.94s)]
*  I met with border patrol agents. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=209.78s)]
*  I'm sure you've been to the border as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  I want to get to my next question. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=214.46s)]
*  I want to make sure my staff has written my questions clearly because I can't think without [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=217.1s)]
*  the papers in front. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=221.34s)]
*  But of course, once again, Bondi exposed the Democrats real priority and it is not the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  safety of the American people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=228.94s)]
*  Now, perhaps the most hilarious of many hilarious parts of the spectacle was when Democrats [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  had the nerve to try to skewer Bondi on the weaponization of the justice system. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  It would not be appropriate for a prosecutor to start with a name and look for a crime. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=244.1s)]
*  It's a prosecutor's job to start with a crime and look for a name, correct? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=253.22s)]
*  Senator, I think that is the whole problem with the weaponization that we have seen the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=259.46s)]
*  last four years and what's been happening to Donald Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  They targeted Donald Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=268.42s)]
*  They went after him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=270.4s)]
*  I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=271.58s)]
*  Justice will be administered even handedly throughout this country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=277.34s)]
*  I love it when the senators do this to convey that they're bored with the whole proceeding. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=282.82s)]
*  Well, Newsflash, we're bored with you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=287.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=289.5s)]
*  Finally, under the leadership of A.G. Bondi, I think the scales of justice will be at balance [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=290.5s)]
*  again. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=295.9s)]
*  No more using the FBI as a retribution squad, no more messing with the FISA courts, no more [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=296.9s)]
*  activist U.S. attorneys. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=302.7s)]
*  I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=305.12s)]
*  and each of its components. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=311.82s)]
*  The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  America will have one tier of justice for all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  As it always should have been and will be again. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=325.42s)]
*  We just got our hands on the inaugural portrait of the soon to be 47th president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump projecting a fierce glare, a little bit different from his portrait from 2017 [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=334.06s)]
*  where he was all smiles. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=339.18s)]
*  His new pic has mugshot vibes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  And in five days, we'll make it official. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=343.74s)]
*  And Democrats can't get it together. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  Usually it's the cabinet nominees getting raked over the coals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=348.38s)]
*  But for the last two days, it's been the Democrats who've been facing a public shaming. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=351.34s)]
*  After leadoff hitter Pete Hegseth hit a home run, Pam Bondi, the A.G. nominee came out [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=356.94s)]
*  swinging. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=363.02s)]
*  You say the right things that you're going to be the people's lawyer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=364.9s)]
*  That's what you have to say to be here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=369.53999999999996s)]
*  I need to clarify something that you said that I have to sit up here and say these things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=372.38s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=377.34s)]
*  I sit up here and speak the truth. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=378.46s)]
*  I'm not going to sit up here and say anything that I need to say to get confirmed by this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=381.5s)]
*  body. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=387.58s)]
*  I don't have to say anything. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=388.58s)]
*  I will answer the questions to the best of my ability. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=389.73999999999995s)]
*  It was clear that Senate Democrats had no intention of giving Pam a fair hearing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=393.62s)]
*  After putting words in Pete's mouth yesterday, today the undistinguished senator from Hawaii [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  was as annoying as usual. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=404.26s)]
*  If President-elect Trump asks, suggests or hints that you as attorney general should [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=409.38s)]
*  investigate one of his perceived political enemies, would you do so? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=415.5s)]
*  Senator Gerono, I wish you had met with me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=422.18s)]
*  Had you met with me, we could have discussed many things and gotten to know you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=424.5s)]
*  I am listening to you now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=427.98s)]
*  Could you respond to the question? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you were the only one who refused to meet with me, Senator. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=431.7s)]
*  Democrats don't want to meet with Bondi because they don't want to get to know her. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=436.46s)]
*  Then it's much easier for them to batter and dehumanize her as a political punching bag. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=440.78s)]
*  But Bondi stood up for herself every single time. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  Democrats thought they could make her look like a dumb blonde, but Bondi ended up making [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=449.58s)]
*  them look like fools. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=453.58s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  Your job will be, I'm speaking, your job will be to protect voters and election workers, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  not to undermine and dox them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=463.46s)]
*  The president-elect's inner circle continues to spread the big lie about the 2020 election. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=465.82s)]
*  Then we'll move on to a different topic. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=470.54s)]
*  Senator, you were speaking, may I speak? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=473.42s)]
*  You cut me off when I was speaking. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=476.74s)]
*  When I ask you the next question, you can speak and I hope you answer, Ms. Bondi. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=477.74s)]
*  I'd like to answer the previous one, Senator. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=479.94s)]
*  When we met yesterday, you did not seem to be familiar with the citizenship clause of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  the United States of America, which was deeply disappointing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=490.58s)]
*  I guess you didn't want to hear my answer about Pennsylvania. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=493.98s)]
*  I gave you an opportunity to study overnight. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  So can you tell me in this committee what the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=500.02s)]
*  says? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=504.18s)]
*  Senator, I'm here to answer your questions. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=505.18s)]
*  I'm not here to do your homework and study for you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=508.02s)]
*  Every question she was asked was to appease the loony left wing of their party. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=511.94s)]
*  January 6th, enemies list, is Trump a dictator? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=516.38s)]
*  These aren't serious people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=520.9s)]
*  A simple question of constitutional interpretation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=523.7s)]
*  Is president elect Trump eligible to run for another term as president in 2028? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=526.66s)]
*  No, Senator, not unless they change the constitution. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=532.22s)]
*  Bondi was a former prosecutor, the attorney general for the state of Florida and Trump's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=538.22s)]
*  personal attorney during impeachment. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=541.74s)]
*  If she's confirmed her main priority is fighting crime, cartel crime, white collar, fraud, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=544.1s)]
*  guns, drugs, sex trafficking, terrorism. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=550.78s)]
*  All Adam Schiff wanted to know was, are you going to leave Liz Cheney alone? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=554.54s)]
*  Are you aware of any factual basis to investigate Liz Cheney? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=559.54s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=563.5s)]
*  Senator, that's a hypothetical and I'm not going to answer that question. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=564.5s)]
*  No, it's not a hypothetical. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=567.54s)]
*  No one has asked me to investigate Liz. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=569.06s)]
*  We're also worried about Liz Cheney. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  The president has called for this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=573.62s)]
*  You know what we should be worried about? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=574.62s)]
*  Ms. Bondi, please answer my questions. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  The crime rate in California right now is the roof. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  Ms. Bondi. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=580.1s)]
*  Your robberies are 87% higher than the national average. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=581.1s)]
*  Senator what I can tell you is I will never play politics. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=585.7800000000001s)]
*  You're trying to engage me in a gotcha. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=589.1s)]
*  I won't do it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=591.34s)]
*  I won't play politics with any ongoing investigation like you did leaving your colleague Devin Nunes's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=592.34s)]
*  memo. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=599.34s)]
*  I'm not going to mislead this body nor you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=600.34s)]
*  Let me ask another question. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=604.9000000000001s)]
*  You don't want to answer that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  You're censured by Congress for comments just like this that are so reckless. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=607.18s)]
*  Well this is exactly what Biden did. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=612.3s)]
*  As the crime rate exploded, Joe told Garland to prosecute Trump. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=614.0999999999999s)]
*  The Democrats were completely oblivious to how they looked, especially after what they [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=618.3s)]
*  perpetrated over the last four years. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=623.06s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=625.38s)]
*  And it would not be appropriate for a prosecutor to start with a name and look for a crime. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=628.14s)]
*  It's a prosecutor's job to start with a crime and look for a name, correct? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=638.9399999999999s)]
*  Senator I think that is the whole problem with the weaponization that we have seen the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=646.58s)]
*  last four years and what's been happening to Donald Trump. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=650.34s)]
*  They targeted Donald Trump. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=654.14s)]
*  They went after him. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=656.1s)]
*  Actually, starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=657.46s)]
*  They have launched countless investigations against him. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=662.38s)]
*  That will not be the case if I am attorney general. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  I will not politicize that office. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=669.46s)]
*  Pam's not a partisan actor who's there to settle scores. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  If there's probable cause that a crime has been committed by Nancy or Alvin or our good [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=675.7s)]
*  friend Fannie, I'm sure she'll look into it, but she's not there to collect scalps. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=681.26s)]
*  She's there to clean house and return the department to what it should be, a crime-fighting [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=686.06s)]
*  department, focused on protecting the American people, not one political party. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=691.78s)]
*  Pam Bondi is young, polished, tenacious, and the Trump team was very pleased with how the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=697.78s)]
*  hearing went. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=701.9s)]
*  The three other nominees, the big ones who had their hearings today, John Ratcliffe for [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=703.22s)]
*  CIA, Marco Rubio for state and Sean Duffy for transportation, all breezed through the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=706.9s)]
*  hearings. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=712.38s)]
*  Democrats didn't even put up a fight. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=713.38s)]
*  And so far, all the nominees have presented strong, smart, and principled cases for their [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=716.06s)]
*  nominations. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=720.18s)]
*  The Republican Party is unified around them. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=721.66s)]
*  It's refreshing, isn't it? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=724.86s)]
*  But Democrats keep getting caught flat-footed. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=726.86s)]
*  Nothing seems to be working. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=729.7s)]
*  Schumer promised fireworks, but all of his foot soldiers are getting outfoxed. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=731.62s)]
*  Schumer said Republicans were going to suffer brand damage after these hearings. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=736.54s)]
*  So we've just seen Senate Democrats embarrass themselves, one after the other. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=741.38s)]
*  The Democrat machine is broken. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=746.66s)]
*  It's leaderless. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=748.68s)]
*  The donors are disgusted. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=750.1s)]
*  The media is collapsing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=751.9s)]
*  The big tech billionaires are switching sides. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=753.36s)]
*  And Hollywood's on fire. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=755.9s)]
*  They're fighting for their lives. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=757.42s)]
*  We're starting to see that without a well-funded and well-oiled propaganda machine and cancel [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=759.78s)]
*  culture enforcers, the party doesn't have the power, the discipline, or the narratives [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=764.64s)]
*  they need to survive. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=769.54s)]
*  Trump's election has shattered that machine into a million pieces. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=771.74s)]
*  And we have no idea how long it's going to take for them to put it back together. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=775.94s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=782.38s)]
*  And tonight we are T minus five days until Donald J. Trump is sworn into office. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=783.38s)]
*  But tonight, things, big things, are already underway. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=789.06s)]
*  Here at home, Donald Trump's cabinet nominees, they are demonstrating a very high level of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=793.26s)]
*  confidence and integrity at their Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=797.42s)]
*  Also coming up tonight, we will show you how Donald Trump's pick for AG, Pam Bondi, literally [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=801.3s)]
*  flipped the script on the congenital liar Adam Schiff. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=807.22s)]
*  It was a moment. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=810.74s)]
*  If you missed it, you missed a lot. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=811.82s)]
*  Also tonight, a major accomplishment for the president-elect overseas. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=813.9399999999999s)]
*  This is really big news and good news. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=818.02s)]
*  We're going to bring you the details of the Middle East peace deal that was reached with [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=820.7s)]
*  Donald Trump getting it across the finish line. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=826.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=829.66s)]
*  By strength, by fear that he instilled in foreign adversaries. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=830.66s)]
*  And they know he means what he says. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=835.82s)]
*  But first, I don't know any other way to put it, just a pathetic farewell address from a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=837.62s)]
*  frankly pathetic career politician filled with delusion of success and petty political [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=845.0600000000001s)]
*  attacks. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=851.46s)]
*  What you just heard tonight, the typical mumbling, bumbling and stumbling as usual, every cliché [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=852.66s)]
*  imaginable, false hope for the next president to do so well after really doing nothing but [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=858.5s)]
*  sabotage Donald Trump before he gets into office, a corrupt family, a weaponized DOJ [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=864.42s)]
*  that has caused massive harm to our justice system. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=871.46s)]
*  In the end, a sad, pathetic, angry man that you decide, what did he accomplish? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=875.22s)]
*  Ask yourself. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=882.9s)]
*  He failed to mention that we are now on, by the way, preemptive pardon watch as the president [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=883.9s)]
*  now reportedly considering get out of jail free cards for his brother, for Anthony Fauci, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=888.34s)]
*  for Liz Cheney, for Benny Thompson, and a whole list of others, maybe even himself. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=893.74s)]
*  He also failed to mention his greatest legacy, and that is the millions upon millions and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=899.94s)]
*  millions of unvetted illegal immigrants that poured into this country, including violent [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=905.02s)]
*  criminals, murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members, and known terrorists. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=911.66s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=918.22s)]
*  We know that they are here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=919.22s)]
*  This is what Joe is leaving behind for Donald J. Trump. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=921.4200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, mark my words, the greatest legacy of Joe Biden will be these unvetted [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  illegal immigrants, the crimes they commit, and the possible terror attacks on our homeland. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=931.58s)]
*  Instead, in tonight's, quote, farewell address, we got more class warfare against a handful [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=936.9000000000001s)]
*  of billionaires, oligarchs, as he's calling them, who don't support him. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=942.5s)]
*  His family had no problem taking a lot of money from a Russian oligarch, the former [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=947.3000000000001s)]
*  first lady of Moscow, or dealing with wealthy companies in Ukraine and China. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=951.34s)]
*  He didn't mention that part either. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=955.9000000000001s)]

*  change, the biggest existential threat to our country, and a call for more censorship [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=962.78s)]
*  online after it was Joe Biden himself who coerced big tech into censoring the facts [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=967.94s)]
*  about COVID-19, along with the truth about the very real laptop of his son Hunter. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=974.58s)]
*  And that real story, that was Wink and Tony Blinken that tried to cover it up, organizing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=981.38s)]
*  a letter with 51 former intelligence officials, supposedly debunking the story as Russian [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=986.98s)]
*  disinformation to give him a talking point before a debate. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=992.46s)]
*  And meanwhile, not one of those people ever one time saw that laptop or knew a thing about [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=996.0200000000001s)]
*  the laptop. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1000.46s)]
*  This was a typical Biden speech. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1001.74s)]
*  It was disorganized. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1003.5400000000001s)]
*  It was mumbling. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1005.1800000000001s)]
*  It was uninspiring, riddled with visions of grandeur about himself, along with doom and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1006.1800000000001s)]
*  gloom about political rivals. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1011.3000000000001s)]
*  You decide. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1013.3800000000001s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1014.94s)]
*  This is a dangerous constant, and that's the dangerous concentration of power in the hands [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1022.5400000000001s)]
*  of a very few ultra wealthy people. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1026.9s)]

*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1035.74s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1041.8999999999999s)]
*  Right now, the existential threat of climate change has never been clear. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1044.58s)]
*  Just look across the country from California to North Carolina. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1050.82s)]
*  That's why I signed the most significant climate and clean energy law ever. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1055.8999999999999s)]

*  to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1065.74s)]
*  Humans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1071.82s)]
*  the abuse of power. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1078.02s)]

*  We need to amend the Constitution to make clear that no president, no president is immune [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1092.78s)]
*  from crimes that he or she commits while in office. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1097.94s)]
*  It was his administration, his DOJ, that was pressuring Big Tech to tell a lot of those [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1101.18s)]
*  lies. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1108.02s)]
*  You can't make that part up. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1109.02s)]
*  Now ultimately Biden's five decades in the Washington swamp were never about service [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1110.18s)]
*  or making this a better place, always about himself and his own personal gain. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1114.94s)]
*  The results, they speak for himself. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1120.46s)]
*  So tonight, look, forget about what I think. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1122.54s)]
*  Ask yourself, every American needs to ask themselves tonight, are you better off than [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1125.82s)]

*  Are you better off? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1149.08s)]
*  Are you more safe and more secure both here at home and abroad? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1150.5s)]
*  After nearly 50 years of working for government, Biden, he owns multi-million dollar mansions. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1155.22s)]
*  He goes on lavish vacations. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1161.14s)]
*  He's worth reportedly millions of dollars with most of his career. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1163.54s)]
*  He made $200,000 or less and people will always call him Mr. President. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1167.42s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1172.82s)]
*  At the same time, Americans, most Americans I know, and the polls show this and confirm [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1173.82s)]
*  this are far worse off, especially the middle class that he claims to have a monopoly of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1178.78s)]
*  compassion on. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1183.4199999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't seem to care less for him. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1184.78s)]
*  It's his mission accomplished moment. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1187.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, the incoming administration is already, they're hitting the ground running. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1189.58s)]
*  This is an amazing phenomenon we are witnessing before our eyes. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1193.8s)]
*  Real successes for you, the American people. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1198.12s)]

*  Breaking today, a ceasefire deal in Gaza. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1204.34s)]
*  That means freedom for 33 hostages, hopefully more a plan for a lasting peace. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1207.54s)]
*  Just one week after Donald J. Trump delivered this warning. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1213.6599999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1217.72s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1218.72s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1223.86s)]
*  East and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good frankly for anyone. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1228.68s)]
*  All hell will break out. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1234.26s)]
*  I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1235.42s)]
*  And they should have given them back a long time. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1237.78s)]
*  They should have never taken them. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1239.18s)]
*  They should have never been the attack of October 7th. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1241.02s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1243.74s)]
*  Today would not have happened or not for that moment. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1246.58s)]
*  Donald Trump, he didn't just warn the terrorists of Hamas and their friends in the Middle East. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1249.54s)]
*  He took action. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1254.42s)]
*  The president-elect, he sent a delegation. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1255.5s)]
*  You saw Steve Witkoff in that video to the region to negotiate a deal. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1258.1s)]
*  A deal has been struck. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1262.4s)]
*  Donald Trump made more progress in one meeting than Joe Biden did all year. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1265.1000000000001s)]
*  Top Qatari officials now said Trump and his envoy pushed this deal over the finish line [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1270.3000000000002s)]
*  and they thank Trump for his leadership. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1276.5800000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1279.0600000000002s)]
*  You, as you say, have been working on this deal for many months. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1280.0600000000002s)]
*  And the question is, why now? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1284.5s)]
*  Why this moment? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1286.6200000000001s)]
*  And was it pressure from the incoming Trump administration that got it over the line? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1288.0600000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1292.66s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for this question. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1293.8200000000002s)]
*  Actually, we've been raising the question of the right moment for the entire period [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1296.74s)]
*  since the collapse of the first phase. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1302.18s)]
*  But we have seen a momentum that started to build in the last month and we kept pushing [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1306.46s)]
*  for that, working together very closely with our partners. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1310.98s)]
*  And I can say that what we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1315.1s)]
*  transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1323.9399999999998s)]
*  to reach to that deal. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1330.1399999999999s)]
*  And I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1332.2199999999998s)]
*  Instead of being happy, back at the White House, Joe Biden was seething one day, of [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1337.78s)]
*  course, after forgetting how to sign his name on a bill during a bill signing ceremony. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1342.6599999999999s)]
*  The frankly petty and competent current president tried to take full credit for the plea deal. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1347.54s)]
*  He announced about two hours after Donald Trump. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1353.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1356.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1357.34s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1358.34s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1361.34s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1364.34s)]
*  No, that would be Donald Trump made this happen, not him. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1367.34s)]
*  That's the joke. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1372.74s)]
*  Anyway, Joe Biden, maybe he should circle back to his own State Department. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1373.74s)]
*  They thanked Donald Trump earlier today in case he missed it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1378.24s)]
*  When it comes to the involvement of President-elect Trump's team, it has been absolutely critical [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1381.4599999999998s)]
*  in getting this deal over the line. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1386.0s)]
*  I would just say, lastly, I don't know if it's unprecedented to have envoys from an [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1387.54s)]
*  outgoing and an incoming administration sitting at the same table negotiating a ceasefire [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1394.06s)]
*  agreement of this kind. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1399.22s)]
*  But if it's not unprecedented, it's certainly unusual. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1400.7s)]
*  And we, of course, thank the Trump team for working with this on this ceasefire agreement. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1403.22s)]
*  I think it's important that they were at the table. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1408.74s)]
*  You know, it's interesting because it was Donald Trump that sent his envoy on his own [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1412.54s)]
*  dime to the Middle East to relay the message that all hell would break loose if, in fact, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1417.58s)]
*  they didn't get this deal done. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1422.98s)]
*  As we look back on the four years of Joe Biden's presidency, do you think he was qualified [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1425.86s)]
*  for this job? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1431.74s)]
*  Were we right when we warned before the 2020 election that he was not cognitively strong [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1432.74s)]
*  enough for the job? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1438.3s)]
*  Again, that's a decision you, the American people, have to make. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1439.3s)]
*  So we're about a week since the wildfire started, and it's odd that not a single leader has [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1442.74s)]
*  risen from this catastrophe. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1447.62s)]
*  Oh, there's plenty of ash, but no phoenix rising from it, just chickens with their heads [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1449.1s)]
*  cut off. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1454.7399999999998s)]
*  We now learn that LA Mayor Karen Bass was hosting a cocktail party in Ghana when the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1456.3s)]
*  catastrophe started. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1460.4599999999998s)]
*  We heard she was handing out shots of fireball. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1462.34s)]
*  But not one single heroic person of action. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1465.1s)]
*  Hell, even Smokey the Bear is nowhere to be found. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1470.54s)]
*  Someone said he moved to Florida two years ago for the lower taxes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1474.1399999999999s)]
*  Instead, you get this. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1477.58s)]
*  We're dealing with a myriad of issues. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1480.3s)]
*  I was just talking to Josh Green, the governor, of down in Hawaii, who had some ideas around [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1482.66s)]
*  some land use concerns he has around speculators coming in, buying up properties. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1488.78s)]
*  What's this? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  It's like you saw a hypnotist years ago who said, from now on, every time you hear the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1498.46s)]
*  word fire, you will start to dance. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1501.8600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't even know it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1503.94s)]
*  But I guess that's what snakes do when they feel threatened. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1506.38s)]
*  Then there's Cam. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1509.54s)]
*  It's critically important that to the extent you can find anything that gives you an ability [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1511.54s)]
*  to be patient in this extremely dangerous and unprecedented crisis that you do. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1517.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, be patient. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1527.1s)]
*  For what exactly? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1530.02s)]
*  For you to complete a real sentence? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1531.02s)]
*  We could hear it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1533.62s)]
*  We could be here for months. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1534.62s)]
*  She's like a talking parrot with a speech impediment, making no sense and complaining [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1535.62s)]
*  about crackers. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1540.94s)]
*  Then there's this idiot. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1544.8600000000001s)]
*  Looking back, would you have taken that trip overseas? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1546.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, I am going to focus today on what we know. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1549.8200000000002s)]
*  Truly a real inspiration for homicide. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1560.46s)]
*  Then the big guy. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1566.14s)]
*  You'd have this fire going crazy and burning everything down and three houses being fine. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1568.38s)]
*  Or neighborhoods that were still green. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1575.9s)]
*  That house next door still has green shrubbery on it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1579.3s)]
*  And you know, the house is fine. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1583.42s)]
*  There's only, I think, four or five houses in that 200, you know, in the Pasadena area. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  My generic point is, it's almost like it's a battle scene. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1592.42s)]
*  Thanks for the update, dipsh**t. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1598.14s)]
*  You know, if that was a painting by Picasso, it would have been called a babbling retard. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1601.14s)]
*  Now, the reason no leader has emerged is because they've been soaking in identity politics [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1612.6200000000001s)]
*  like Newsom's head in a vat of styling gel. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1618.3400000000001s)]
*  So if the issue isn't race or gender, they're lost. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1621.82s)]
*  So sure, Karen Bass can unveil a new pride flag, but if it catches fire, everyone ends [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1625.6599999999999s)]
*  up flaming. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1631.02s)]
*  So you have the biggest fire in LA history and they can't even figure out the first step [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1633.76s)]
*  to help people. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1637.46s)]
*  They're like some weirdo who goes to the gym and only works out their neck muscles. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1638.46s)]
*  Picture that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1643.98s)]
*  A freak with a neck. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1644.98s)]
*  The neck's so big it cuts off blood flow to the brain and everything else is atrophied. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1649.98s)]
*  In this case, they failed to build the muscles that would respond to any or all real problems. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1655.7s)]
*  Whether it's immigration, crime or natural disasters, they come up empty because in their [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1661.26s)]
*  toolkit there is but one single club, identity politics, and it can't help them. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1665.28s)]
*  But it helped them personally before the fire. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1671.44s)]
*  After all, it's light on effort but rich in public reward and the media eats it up. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1673.74s)]
*  And much of California voted for it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1679.4s)]
*  Hell, Hollywood lobbied and politiced on behalf of it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1681.44s)]
*  It's easy to see why. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1684.8000000000002s)]
*  Surface level celebs found identity politics right up their alley. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1686.76s)]
*  By faking empathy, you appear to do something without having to lift a finger. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1690.3400000000001s)]
*  Hey, look everybody, not only do I play the good guy in movies, but I'm one in real life [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1694.48s)]
*  too. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1698.8400000000001s)]
*  It's same with pushing climate hysteria. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  Just saying we must do something means you don't have to do anything. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1701.6200000000001s)]
*  Just shout platitudes and you're back on your private jet out of LA with your girlfriend [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1705.8s)]
*  and her algebra tutor. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1712.2s)]
*  Of course, you could have done all the things needed to help combat fires while pushing [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1714.24s)]
*  climate change, but they didn't. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1720.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1722.2s)]
*  Because as a boneheaded student might say, that wasn't supposed to be on the test. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1723.2s)]
*  They live in a world of theory and not reality and it only helps the cynical bozos who employ [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1728.24s)]
*  it. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1733.12s)]
*  The things they elevate are merely exploited on behalf of public virtue. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1734.12s)]
*  These pawns don't learn anything or gain experience. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1738.2399999999998s)]
*  Instead, they are placed in jobs where they fail because they didn't learn anything or [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1740.36s)]
*  have any experience. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1744.1599999999999s)]
*  Then they end up in positions where life matters and not just black ones. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not so bad if Coke or Pepsi does it, but when it comes to public safety, this farce [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1750.08s)]
*  is deadly. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1755.56s)]
*  So while billion dollar corporations bought into this stuff because it's mere pocket [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1756.8999999999999s)]
*  change to them, the rest of us, we pay with our lives. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1760.56s)]
*  Fact is, identity politics is the most selfish enterprise on earth, for it makes it all about [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1764.36s)]
*  you as you pretend to be about others and 99.9% of all real practical problems go unsolved. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  Homelessness, illegal immigration, fire, floods, the view. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1776.2s)]
*  That's why LA is leaderless because those in charge, by embracing vanity causes, chose [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1783.2s)]
*  themselves over the people they govern. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1789.8s)]
*  Talk about a sick burn. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1792.56s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1795.08s)]

*  She's in her third trimester, so you better not test her. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1821.7199999999998s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Tubbs. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1825.04s)]

*  Michael, it must be hard for you to sympathize with people who've lost homes since you never [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1843.2s)]
*  had one before. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1846.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1849.64s)]
*  I identify as a home challenged, clam bake attendee. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1850.64s)]
*  Are you upset that a lot of homeless are being blamed for starting fires? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1856.8400000000001s)]
*  I am. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1861.88s)]
*  It is because it's also crack heads and meth heads. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1863.52s)]
*  It's not just homeless. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1866.8s)]
*  Climate change is what they tell us. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  They have the same brainiacs who gives them no excuse. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1872.1599999999999s)]
*  You can't sit there and go, listen, there's going to be a lot of fires. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1876.28s)]
*  Climate's changing. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1879.4399999999998s)]
*  There's going to be fires. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1880.4399999999998s)]
*  What did you just cut? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, the firefighting department. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1882.4399999999998s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1883.4399999999998s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's not one Republican to blame. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  You got Gavin Newsom dancing around like he might get hit by a hunk of truth. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1888.84s)]
*  The mayor's on vacation. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1893.9599999999998s)]
*  My favorite was the head of the fire department, the big giant lady who's like, I can't carry [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1896.8s)]
*  a guy out of a house. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1901.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1902.8s)]

*  Yeah, that's when I'll need you, dumbass. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1906.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  My legs are broken. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1910.6000000000001s)]

*  That would be the wrong spot. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1914.24s)]
*  There is no right spot when you're on fire. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1917.52s)]
*  You just have to rotate so that it evens out the burn. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1918.52s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1922.84s)]
*  They need to have like one Republican in government in Los Angeles, though. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1923.84s)]
*  Just one. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1930.0s)]
*  They can blame it on him. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1932.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1933.0s)]
*  Because this is a Democrat thing from top to bottom. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1934.0s)]
*  So I hereby volunteer. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1935.56s)]
*  I will be the scapegoat for LA problems. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1937.24s)]
*  They can just blame me. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1940.28s)]
*  I figure I'll make $750,000 a year, like the lady who runs the Department of Water and [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1941.28s)]
*  Power. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1946.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1947.16s)]
*  She makes three quarters of a million dollars a year and they ran out of water and power. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1948.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1954.56s)]
*  Eric, congratulations on the new book, Wise Guys in the White House Gangsters, Presidents [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1957.36s)]
*  and the Deals They Made. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1962.8s)]
*  This sounds pretty awesome. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1963.9599999999998s)]
*  And you are an expert in crisis management. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  You've had some pretty famous clients. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1968.4799999999998s)]
*  I know you can't name them. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1970.08s)]
*  Maybe one rhymes with Shil Bosby, but we won't get into it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1971.6s)]
*  This leadership is in crisis right now. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1978.24s)]
*  In LA, yeah. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1981.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1982.1999999999998s)]
*  What kind, what would you tell them to do? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1983.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, the job of a politician is to accept credit for things they didn't achieve [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1985.32s)]
*  and to accept blame for a problem they didn't cause. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1991.0s)]
*  And I remember years ago watching the LA earthquake. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1993.96s)]
*  This was about 1994 and a reporter went up to a city manager and went, what went wrong [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=1997.4199999999998s)]
*  here? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2002.36s)]
*  Well, a tectonic plate moved. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2003.36s)]
*  That's what went wrong. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2005.72s)]
*  But in the media climate that we are in, the only currency we understand is blame. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2007.08s)]
*  And that is when I have a client in this situation, they want to talk about this and that. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2014.36s)]
*  The only thing that they talk about is blame. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2019.0s)]
*  Now here's the challenge. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2022.12s)]
*  There is really no way to get out of it, even though people think there is. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2024.6s)]
*  And what ends up happening is everything that is in the ether, DEI, going to Ghana, not [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2029.4399999999998s)]
*  giving the fire department enough money, whether you caused it or not, it doesn't matter. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2037.36s)]
*  In our situation, the mayor is unsurvivable. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2043.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2045.6799999999998s)]
*  Now what remains to be seen is Gavin Newsom because he may have a future and what he's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2046.6799999999998s)]
*  going to have to show is the thing that Americans want to see more than anything in a politician, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2051.44s)]
*  which is your capacity to take your beating. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2056.4s)]
*  Yeah, and also, great points. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2058.84s)]
*  It's not so much the thing, it's what you do after the thing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, if you make a mistake, you're not judged for it, you just try to do it better next [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2065.68s)]
*  But you see with this constant churning of identity politics, it's incapable of change [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  because the ideology matters more, Kat. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2076.2s)]
*  What was with the weird dance? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2079.52s)]
*  Did you think he has hemorrhoids? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2081.0s)]
*  Sometimes you have to do that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2085.0s)]
*  He was standing up. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2086.48s)]
*  Well, still. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2088.0s)]
*  Now I think you have hemorrhoids. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2092.52s)]
*  You're pregnant, you're going to get hemorrhoids. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2093.52s)]
*  Thank you for sharing that with me. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2097.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that also she's not even trying, right? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2101.2400000000002s)]
*  The mayor's not even trying. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2102.52s)]
*  When she was, I keep going back to that clip where the reporter is trying to ask her questions [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2103.52s)]
*  and she just doesn't answer because by not answering what she's implying with that is [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2106.92s)]
*  like, oh, I better not say something wrong or else things might get really bad. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2113.12s)]
*  And the people watching that are people who either their house is burned down or they [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2118.96s)]
*  are reasonably afraid that their house is going to burn down at some time in the near [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2122.6s)]
*  future. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2126.6s)]
*  So in that moment her main concern is still herself. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2127.68s)]
*  And oh no, if I say something wrong then things are going to get worse for me. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2131.7599999999998s)]
*  I think there's really no way things can get worse for you anyway. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2135.3599999999997s)]
*  So you should at least try to say something. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2138.44s)]
*  It's the least you could do, but I think that it's totally just... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2141.6s)]
*  She's acting like a dude in a relationship. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2145.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2147.6s)]
*  She is. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2148.6s)]
*  Yeah, you just try not to say anything because you think if anything I say I'm screwed. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2149.6s)]
*  Yeah, or like when you're like... [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2153.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2155.04s)]
*  Like, oh, stop. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2157.56s)]
*  Not like other girls' bikini pictures. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2160.12s)]
*  I guess I'll just delete the app then. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2162.08s)]
*  That's great. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2168.92s)]
*  Fine, if you want me to delete the app, I will. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2169.92s)]
*  It's like, no, we're not even talking about the thing anymore. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2171.7200000000003s)]
*  Just talk about the thing. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2174.6s)]
*  You owe me that. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2176.16s)]
*  You know, Tyrus... [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2177.16s)]
*  Okay, before you go, I have to push back and blame this on dudes. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2179.16s)]
*  Okay? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2182.6s)]
*  No. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2183.6s)]
*  If the spot is bad, we leave. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2184.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2186.2799999999997s)]
*  She's not leaving. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a woman. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2188.2799999999997s)]
*  So don't put it on us because at the airport when they surrounded me, like, Tyrus, what [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  are you going to say? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2193.08s)]
*  And, hey, man, is that flight going to Oklahoma? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2194.08s)]
*  And I would have left. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2197.24s)]
*  We saw exactly who she was when there was no one there to prep her and tell her what [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2200.24s)]
*  to say. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2206.56s)]
*  And at the airport, the incompetence, the ignorance, and that is exactly why she was [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2207.56s)]
*  put in that position in the first place. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2214.28s)]
*  The people that funded her, the people that paid for her campaign, all they needed to [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2216.44s)]
*  do was to sign and say little speeches for their agenda. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2220.0s)]
*  And she was the perfect thing because if you challenge her, her first response is, you're [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2222.92s)]
*  doing it because I'm a woman. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2227.32s)]
*  And if you're a white person, you're doing it because I'm black. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2229.0800000000004s)]
*  And then if you get past both of those, you're doing this because I'm part of the rainbow. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2232.96s)]
*  So all those are contingency plans. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2237.44s)]
*  But unfortunately, black rainbow woman has nothing to do with you partying it up by the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2240.22s)]
*  city that you were sworn in to protect is burning to the ground. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2245.18s)]
*  So she had no answers. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2249.0s)]
*  But it's not, and it's funny because you talk about all the time, like, there's too many [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2250.66s)]
*  old white men in politics. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2253.58s)]
*  When you look at California's setup, it's pretty much the same thing. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2255.74s)]
*  Isn't that a little bit peculiar that it's all the same thing? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2261.06s)]
*  Was it when Whitey did that? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2264.7799999999997s)]
*  It was a huge problem. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2265.8999999999996s)]
*  But then they could put all their friends and buddies in positions, all not qualified. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2267.4s)]
*  Also, while this happens, if Newsom is smart, he'll let it go for another week. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  And this dance is, he, while he was doing the interview, realized I'm going to blame [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2276.56s)]
*  this on the mayor. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2281.0s)]
*  That's what this was. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2282.0s)]
*  That was a celebration. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2284.2000000000003s)]
*  That was a celebration like, I've got it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2286.2000000000003s)]
*  The mayor did it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2288.88s)]
*  Blame shimmy. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2291.96s)]
*  Well, I think you're getting to something that is important, which is force of personality. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2294.0800000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that does happen that is relevant in a crisis situation is does [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2299.56s)]
*  somebody have a certain amount of strength? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2304.2000000000003s)]
*  And I remember I had a client, the CEO of a very large company, and a reporter stood [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2306.84s)]
*  up and said, you are one of the biggest polluters in this country. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2311.56s)]
*  He said, you're wrong. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2314.52s)]
*  We are one of the biggest polluters in the world. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2315.52s)]
*  And let me tell you what we're trying to do about it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2318.88s)]
*  It was so disarming. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2320.8s)]
*  And one of the things I think people, whether you like them or not, admired about Trump [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2322.6s)]
*  is his capacity to be forceful. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2328.6s)]
*  And I think one of the things that people also admired about Bill Clinton was the capacity [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2331.56s)]
*  to endure. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2336.68s)]
*  And when you have a personality like Bass, you have somebody who seems to be running. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KCG_oHXNqw&t=2338.24s)]
