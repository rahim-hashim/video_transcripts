# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 8, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight. The unserious woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=5.46s)]
*  Democrats are in a box. They're trapped inside and it's a box of their own making. Slowly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=14.32s)]
*  but surely, Kamala Harris is being exposed for what she is. An empty pantsuit. Even when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=20.84s)]
*  obvious questions are asked, she won't answer them. You have changed your position on so [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported looser immigration [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=35.36s)]
*  policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=41.56s)]
*  so many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=47.8s)]
*  you've heard that in the last four years. I have been vice president United States and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=54.44s)]
*  I have been traveling our country and I have been listening to folks and seeking what is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are diverse people, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=65.56s)]
*  geographically, regionally in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=72.2s)]
*  people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus where we can figure out [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=78.48s)]
*  compromise and understand it's not a bad thing as long as you don't compromise your values [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=84.28s)]
*  to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  How does that explain the flip flopping again? Well, after this interview, Americans will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=97.44s)]
*  understand why that the campaign had to keep her so sheltered. But that strategy allowed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=101.64s)]
*  Donald Trump to run the table. And since the debate, he's been on the move almost without [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=107.88s)]
*  a break. He's the Energizer Bunny candidate, which is making the media and Democrats very, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  very anxious. He's got such a big problem with men. I mean, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misogynation in in all of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=122.36s)]
*  this black and white men. Big problem. But also the business world. They don't think [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=127.28s)]
*  she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Because she's not a heavyweight. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=132.56s)]
*  Now think about it. Since the coup against Biden, they've tried to promote her as the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=138.56s)]
*  true change candidate. I think people are exhausted and they're ready to turn the page [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=143.32s)]
*  and chart a new way forward. I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=148.6s)]
*  ready to turn the page. I think we all know it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  the page. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. But today on The View, Kamala blew [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=159.68s)]
*  up her own narrative. Would you have done something differently than President Biden [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind. Nothing that comes [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=173.32s)]
*  to mind. So much for being the change candidate. How does she not have a prepared answer for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  that question, by the way? Kamala Harris just wrote a devastating campaign commercial for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=187.04s)]
*  the Trump campaign. Inflation, Afghanistan, the border, all a disaster under Biden. And [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=194.0s)]
*  she can't think of anything she'd do differently. Has the woman not seen the right track, wrong [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=201.76s)]
*  track surveys that are out there? Yeah, not good. If you like the direction that we're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=207.1s)]
*  going in as a country, high gas prices, high grocery bills, the high cost of insurance, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=213.84s)]
*  going to take away your car, the gas powered car, health care costs. Kamala is definitely [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  your gal. She's just another puppet of the failed establishment. She's Biden without [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  the experience. A serious candidate doesn't avoid doing a real press conference and then [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=229.84s)]
*  sit down with a sex and dating podcaster. Can you tell the daddy gang, you know, when [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  people tell you no, when people look at you and doubt you, what does that ignite in you? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=242.8s)]
*  I don't hear no, I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang. Don't hear no. A serious [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=250.52s)]
*  candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but masterful [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=267.54s)]
*  NBC has reported Governor DeSantis is ignoring your calls on hurricanes, resources and help. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=272.94s)]
*  How does that hurt the situation here? It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=280.94s)]
*  and it is about political gamesmanship. It's that it's doing the job that you took a note [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=287.94s)]
*  to put the people first. Now to call her response, dim wooded is an insult to dim wits everywhere. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=293.46s)]
*  She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=300.74s)]
*  whose state is about to get hit by the worst hurricane and what a century. We've been on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=307.26s)]
*  an emergency footing for two weeks straight, around the clock, 24 seven. She has never called [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=313.3s)]
*  on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=320.18s)]
*  Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=325.42s)]
*  any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  I have zero time to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear, it's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  just another fumble. A fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  in the first place. She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=348.18s)]
*  engaged enough to let her twist in the wind. The governor of Florida has been cooperative. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=355.62s)]
*  He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=361.62s)]
*  I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's all being done well. We thank you for it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=367.22s)]
*  And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=372.26s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page because even in his diminished state, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=391.46s)]
*  nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=401.22s)]
*  other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=405.86s)]
*  President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=411.62s)]
*  which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=421.85999999999996s)]
*  majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote and I'm going to work to do that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=445.38s)]
*  But increasingly, it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=452.42s)]
*  lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=457.06s)]
*  And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=466.58000000000004s)]
*  Hi, I'm Bruce Springsteen. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walz for vice [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=472.9s)]
*  president and opposing Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Glory days have passed you by. And you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=478.58s)]
*  Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  I've even heard they're going to beg George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=493.85999999999996s)]
*  cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable of performing the type of functions that we as [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=500.98s)]
*  Americans associate with being the president of the United States. She doesn't understand the issues [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=507.62s)]
*  at the level of detail necessary to make effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=514.34s)]
*  support necessary to bend official Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=519.7s)]
*  needed to read the moods of foreign leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=526.26s)]
*  having a figurehead president with Biden, and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=533.62s)]
*  And yet now they're doing the same thing, only she's even less serious [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=540.66s)]
*  at a time when we face countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=545.62s)]
*  serious trouble. And that's the angle. Oh, Barack's not happy after hiding Harris all fall. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=551.94s)]
*  Democrats watched her numbers drop. It was time to change strategy. Obama ordered Kamala, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  you're doing immediate blitz, but Harris couldn't handle the pressure. She couldn't even survive the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=565.22s)]
*  view. If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=571.22s)]
*  four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=579.14s)]
*  most of the decisions that have had impact. This was the one excuse she had for not solving problems [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=586.5s)]
*  for four years. Hey, you know, I was only VP. I don't call the shots. This was her one saving grace [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  that let people think maybe she's not Joe Biden. Maybe she can be different. Maybe she can bring [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=600.02s)]
*  change. And she just went on the view and said, I'm Joe Biden. I wouldn't have done anything [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=605.22s)]
*  differently the last four years. At the debate, she declared I'm not Joe Biden. And today she says [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  she is. She even flip flopped on whether she's Joe Biden. Afghanistan wouldn't have done anything [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=616.34s)]
*  differently. Inflation, the border, if she had to go back and do it over, she would have done [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=623.7s)]
*  everything the same. If she had a time machine, she'd hurt the country all over again. She has no [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=629.14s)]
*  regrets. She must really hate you. Joe Biden was so unpopular, he got whacked by Democrats, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=635.06s)]
*  and she learned nothing from that. She just went on live TV and said, yeah, Biden, that's my guy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=643.06s)]
*  I'm a Biden Democrat. Now we know how Kamala climbed her way to the top, blind loyalty. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=650.18s)]
*  And now that she's all alone at the top, she doesn't know what to do with herself. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  She's still kissing up to the guy she cooed. This whole election is about change. And she just went [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=663.3s)]
*  on TV and said, I'm more of the same. She handed Trump the one campaign ad that Democrats were [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=670.42s)]
*  dreading. CNN can't believe it. I'm surprised, frankly, that she doesn't have more to say about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=677.54s)]
*  this, given that she and her campaign know that this is one of the main questions that voters have [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=684.9s)]
*  about her. And one of the main things she's been trying to establish as part of her candidacy [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=689.86s)]
*  is the idea that she would represent a break from the past four years. And to not be able to come [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=694.98s)]
*  up with something to say in that moment, she continues to not be particularly nimble on her [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=700.5s)]
*  feet in a lot of these interviews. Who would have thought the view would trip up the Harris campaign? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=706.34s)]
*  They were giving her an opportunity to say, I'm proud to serve with Joe Biden and I'm proud of X, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=712.02s)]
*  Y, and Z, what we did. But I would have told the Fed to wake up and raise rates much earlier, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=718.26s)]
*  crush inflation. And the next four years, I'll show you what I'm made of. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=724.26s)]
*  How am I better at being Harris than Harris? She's been doing this her whole life. She's not very good [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=729.14s)]
*  at it. And if you think she was unprepared for the view, watch her on 60 Minutes. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=735.54s)]
*  The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=742.18s)]
*  knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=747.3000000000001s)]
*  Arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=754.6600000000001s)]
*  to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=762.9s)]
*  It's a long standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=767.38s)]
*  we have been offering solutions. What I was asking was, was it a mistake to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=775.22s)]
*  kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? I think the policies that we have been [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=781.46s)]
*  proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. Okay. But the numbers did quadruple. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=788.82s)]
*  She can't even answer the question because she never tried to fix the border until it was an [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=795.94s)]
*  election year. She claims she sent an immigration bill to Congress on day one and it wasn't taken [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=800.82s)]
*  up. Well, primetime producers investigated because from all we remembered, out of the gate, Biden [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=806.98s)]
*  signed seven executive orders shredding Trump's border policies. We didn't recall a Biden-Harris [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=812.9000000000001s)]
*  immigration bill on inauguration day because Biden-Harris didn't propose a bill fixing the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=818.82s)]
*  immigration system. We discovered they submitted an amnesty bill that would give citizenship to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=825.62s)]
*  all of the illegals in the country. And part of that bill, you can't call them illegals. You have [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=833.22s)]
*  to call them undocumented. Nancy and Chuck controlled the House and the Senate back then. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=838.58s)]
*  No wonder they didn't take it up. It was political suicide. The bill was just a ruse, just like the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=844.34s)]
*  border bill this year. Kamala said Bidenomics was working and the border was secure for four years. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=850.34s)]
*  Now she's saying she has a bunch of solutions to the problems she said weren't problems. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=858.02s)]
*  It's a long-standing problem and solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  we have been offering solutions because solutions are at hand and solutions are at hand. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=872.26s)]
*  So the solution to the border is to blame Trump. What's the solution to high prices? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=878.6600000000001s)]
*  Groceries are 25 percent higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=885.38s)]
*  To your point, prices are still too high. And I know that and we need to deal with it, which is why [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  part of my plan, you mentioned groceries, part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=901.0600000000001s)]
*  of groceries. Kamala Harris then never shares her plan to bring down grocery prices. Bill Whittaker [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=906.1s)]
*  at CBS is forced to tell the audience this. Listen. Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=913.5400000000001s)]
*  ban on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined. What is Bill Whittaker, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=920.4200000000001s)]
*  her interpreter? Inflation is the number one issue in the country. She's on 60 minutes, a month before [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=927.0600000000001s)]
*  the election, and the press has to explain what Harris's plan is because she didn't. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=934.1s)]
*  And CBS is forced to say, like, here's her plan, but there's no details. What am I watching? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=939.62s)]
*  What promise has Kamala ever kept? She said she'd wire rural America with broadband, never did it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=947.22s)]
*  She said she'd build car chargers, never did it. She said she'd secure the border, never did it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=954.5s)]
*  Bring down prices, never did it. Why are we hiring a woman who's never kept a single promise? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=959.62s)]
*  At one point in the interview, 60 Minutes was like, who are you? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=965.38s)]
*  The reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=970.18s)]
*  You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=977.62s)]
*  tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all, now you're not. So many that people don't truly [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  know what you believe or what you stand for, and I know you've heard that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  In the last four years, I have been vice president of the United States, and I have been traveling [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=996.98s)]
*  our country, and I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1001.7s)]
*  ground. I believe in building consensus. Kamala hasn't been seeking common ground, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1008.66s)]
*  she's been seeking common sense. All of these positions she's just adopted are common sense [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1013.9399999999999s)]
*  conservative positions. She didn't build consensus, she's just agreeing with the rest of the country [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1020.26s)]
*  now to get elected. 60 Minutes was like, you realize you didn't earn this, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1026.34s)]
*  Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1031.62s)]
*  nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process, you didn't have to fight off [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1041.78s)]
*  other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  I am proud to have received the endorsement of leaders around this country from every background [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1051.3799999999999s)]
*  and walk of life to fight in this election over the next month for our democracy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1057.86s)]
*  But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1067.4599999999998s)]
*  Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. Kamala struggled to justify why she's running [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1075.3s)]
*  for president and even why she's the nominee. And if you wanted the country to get to know you, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1081.4599999999998s)]
*  why have you been hiding? Everybody that's gotten to know Kamala quit. 72% of her staff [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1086.66s)]
*  worked for her, found out who she was and just walked off the job. All she does ever is talk [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1093.0600000000002s)]
*  about Trump. The country's bored by that. They want to hear from politicians, how are you going [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1098.9s)]
*  to help the country? When you hear, you know, the Vance's and the Trump's talking about what's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1104.1000000000001s)]
*  happening here at home and saying things like America first and make America great again, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1109.6200000000001s)]
*  that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more. Absolutely. Not sometimes, it does resonate a lot [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1113.94s)]
*  more. Democrats see the numbers. Internal polling has Kamala losing Michigan. And now in Wisconsin, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1118.9s)]
*  Democrats say Harris is down three. This is what gamblers do when they're down, double their bets [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1126.02s)]
*  to get out of the hole. That's what Obama's pulling here. Kamala is down. So let's double her media and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1132.18s)]
*  see if we get lucky. If the bet works, Obama's a genius and he can relax with his martini in Hawaii. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1137.94s)]
*  If it doesn't work, Biden's going to say, see, Barry, I told you so. Why do you think I didn't [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1145.14s)]
*  let her out of the White House? So Barry's about to get humiliated. His only option is to save the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1151.6200000000001s)]
*  Senate. So the Messiah is cutting ads for politicians we've never heard of. Building a better future [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1158.18s)]
*  starts by electing people who know you, who see you, and who understand what you're going through. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1165.3s)]
*  That's why it's so important to reelect Jackie Rosen. Jackie who? The whole reason Barack bounced [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1171.86s)]
*  Joe is because he was going to lose the White House and the Senate. If Kamala was the answer, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1179.22s)]
*  why did they all of a sudden need Barack to save the Senate? It doesn't matter. Barack will just [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1184.98s)]
*  blame Nancy. Welcome to Hannity and tonight, Category 5 Hurricane Melton is only hours away [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1190.34s)]
*  from slamming into the already battered communities on Florida's Gulf Coast, right here in the free [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1196.02s)]
*  state of Florida. Many are now rightly worried that this very powerful storm could in fact be [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1201.3799999999999s)]
*  the most destructive hurricane in history. Florida officials are now telling residents who refuse to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1207.06s)]
*  evacuate, write your name on your body so you can be identified if and when you die. Now coming up [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1213.22s)]
*  we'll have a live report from Fox Weather. But first, we are just 28 days until an inflection [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1219.94s)]
*  point for our country. That is called Election Day. A political storm is brewing across the country [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1224.98s)]
*  as the hurricane is now bearing down on Florida. Kamala Harris, she decided to pick a fight with [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis, who's busy trying to save the lives of Floridians and also prestaging 30,000 [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1236.5s)]
*  utility trucks and trucks with water and food and medicine and supplies and she's trashing him in [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1243.94s)]
*  public for not taking the time to speak with her on the phone, a call that he never received. Last [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1250.26s)]
*  night on this program, Governor Ron DeSantis responded. Take a look. For Kamala Harris to try [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1256.98s)]
*  to say that my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional. She has no role [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1263.06s)]
*  in this. In fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years. I've dealt with a number of storms [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1271.54s)]
*  under this administration. She has never contributed anything to any of these efforts. And so what I [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  think is selfish is her trying to blunder into this. No, I've had storms under both President Trump [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1283.3s)]
*  and President Biden and I've worked well with both of them. She's the first one who's trying to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1290.5s)]
*  politicize the storm and she's doing that just because of her campaign. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1296.5s)]
*  She never one time, never before, ever called Governor DeSantis before, during or after any [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1303.78s)]
*  other hurricane and Kamala's trying to pretend that she cares about hurricanes for the very first time [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1309.14s)]
*  ever and DeSantis has per usual is working around the clock trying to save lives and property. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1315.3s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala's boss, Joe Biden, he doesn't seem interested in his vice president's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1322.1s)]
*  dishonest brand of politics. And for the second time this week, Joe Biden has overshadowed [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1328.02s)]
*  Kamala's public appearances with his own counter programming. And today, at the very moment that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1333.86s)]
*  Kamala was meeting with that hard hitting news show, The Ladies of the View, while smearing [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1339.86s)]
*  DeSantis again, Biden talked to reporters at the White House and he preys on the Florida governor. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1345.6999999999998s)]
*  My governor, take a look. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1352.1s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala Harris has literally offered no help to North Carolina, no help to Georgia, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1371.3799999999999s)]
*  South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, none. She's been out on the campaign trail, out in [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1376.82s)]
*  Hollywood raising money. And you may have noticed that both Joe and Jill Biden have been largely [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1381.46s)]
*  absent from the campaign trail. Many now speculating that the Harris campaign was trying to put distance [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1386.1000000000001s)]
*  between the failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration. But today, that hard hitting [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1391.54s)]
*  interview that she had on The View, if, you know, asked if she would do anything differently over [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1397.38s)]
*  the past four years, Kamala said, not a thing. She wouldn't change a thing. Take a look. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1402.5s)]
*  The influence of a personal experience will have its impact on the presidency? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1410.0200000000002s)]
*  Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1414.98s)]
*  during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1421.38s)]
*  part of, of, of most of the decisions that have had impact. But on day one, she's going to change [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1427.94s)]
*  inflation. On day one, she's going to fix the border. Day one was January 20th, 2021. Not a [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1435.62s)]
*  thing, really? Not the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. She was the last person in the room. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1443.46s)]
*  Thirteen American troops dead. Let's see, hundreds of Americans left behind enemy lines. Not the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1450.34s)]
*  carnage overseas funded by Iranian mullahs with the billions that she and Joe made available to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1456.58s)]
*  them. They helped make Iran rich again. What about the record setting inflation caused by a historic [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1463.3s)]
*  level of new spending from Biden and Harris? What about the border crisis? A record 12 plus [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1469.06s)]
*  unvetted illegals from over 180 countries, many with terror ties, many from countries that are top [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1475.7s)]
*  geopolitical foes pouring into the country as her time as border czar. And tonight, our very own [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1482.82s)]
*  Bill Mollusian is reporting that the FBI just arrested an Afghan national allowed in under [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1488.74s)]
*  Harris and Biden, who is plotting an ISIS-inspired terror attack on election day. Oh, and we do have [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1495.3s)]
*  Iranian assassination squads in our country trying to kill Donald Trump. On 60 Minutes of What Became [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1501.22s)]
*  a Trainwreck interview, it was supposed to be a layup interview, Kamala Harris was asked not once, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1508.34s)]
*  not twice, but three times if it was a mistake to allow millions of unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1514.18s)]
*  into the country. She refuses to answer the question. What a shock. Take a look. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1520.18s)]
*  Arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1525.3s)]
*  to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing problem, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1533.54s)]
*  and solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1541.14s)]
*  What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1548.18s)]
*  The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  But the numbers did quadruple. And the numbers today, because of what we have done, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1563.78s)]
*  we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1569.46s)]
*  But we need Congress to be able to act. Was it a mistake? The numbers quadrupled. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1577.78s)]
*  You're the borders are. No answer. Now, coming up tonight, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he'll [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1586.5800000000002s)]
*  join us. He will respond to Kamala's lies and deflections. Now, of course, that 60-minute [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1591.78s)]
*  interview, that that should have been a walk in the park for Kamala Harris. It was designed for [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1597.14s)]
*  her to have a walk in the park. Many of the vice president's worst word salads were actually [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1603.14s)]
*  edited from the interview, shocking from abusively biased CBS. But it was still a disaster for Kamala, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1608.66s)]
*  and that's only the beginning. As panic over poll numbers start to set in, the Harris campaign, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1615.8600000000001s)]
*  that's the only reason they're sending Kamala on this media blitz with friendly outlets, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1621.14s)]
*  CBS, Colbert, The View, Call Her Daddy podcast. Let's see. Oh, Howard Stern. We can't forget about [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1626.5s)]
*  Howard Stern's interview, because she sat down earlier with the former once great shock jock. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1636.82s)]
*  I don't know. He's a shadow of his former self. What the hell happened to Howard? Will the real [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1642.1799999999998s)]
*  Howard ever one day come back? Sadly, now himself as an erotic, woke, polo-loving, cat-loving, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1646.58s)]
*  shadow of his former self, holier than now liberal, who calls any Trump supporter stupid. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1655.94s)]
*  He doesn't want them, I guess, to listen to his program anymore. Paralyzed by the fear of COVID-19, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1661.7s)]
*  asking nothing but pathetic, meaningless questions, and discussing Kamala's favorite brand of cereal. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1667.38s)]
*  Gee, Howard. Will the real Howard, you know, Howard come back to life? Take a look. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1673.8600000000001s)]
*  Why are you eating for breakfast? Raisin Bran, I read. I feel that's not for someone who's healthy, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1680.98s)]
*  and you have a good figure. Why raisin bran? There's a lot of sugar. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1686.98s)]
*  Well, no. So I don't eat raisin bran every morning. But if you asked me what was my [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1690.66s)]
*  favorite cereal, I would put it right up there with, okay, now this is going to be [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1695.54s)]
*  obnoxious and special K. Special K is what they think. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1699.62s)]
*  Well, it's really great. Plus, my mother used to make these special K cookies in honor of me. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1703.06s)]
*  Will the real Howard Stern please return to life? And who cares what cereal the Kamala Harris likes? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1707.86s)]
*  Is this going to move the political needle? Any of these interviews? Not a chance. And by the way, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1715.9399999999998s)]
*  what cereal that Kamala loves costs about 28% more since she became vice president. In fact, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1721.4599999999998s)]
*  most things in America are up over 20%. And while it doesn't seem to matter to the multi-millionaires [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1729.06s)]
*  giving softball interviews to Kamala Harris, these price hikes are like a massive hidden tax [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1734.74s)]
*  for most American families, many of which are putting bare necessities on credit cards. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1740.5s)]
*  But again, as she said on The View, there's not a thing she would have done differently. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1745.3s)]
*  Which brings us back to her administration's terrible hurricane response, the worst in [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1750.02s)]
*  American history. Did you know that Kamala Harris regularly skipped the hurricane preparedness [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1755.06s)]
*  briefings, too busy hanging out with her Hollywood friends? And it kind of seems pretty important [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1760.98s)]
*  now, doesn't it? Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg. Pay attention closely under Biden and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1766.82s)]
*  Harris, FEMA, they had a preoccupation. That preoccupation was with woke politics. The [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1772.58s)]
*  information is right there on fema.com. They're calling it fake news, but it's in their own words. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1780.18s)]
*  There are three stated goals on FEMA's website. Quote, instill equity as a foundation of emergency [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1786.98s)]
*  management. According to the wordy description, this goal is about prioritizing and tailoring [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1795.78s)]
*  emergency management for certain races and gender identities. The second goal, quote, lead whole of [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1801.54s)]
*  community and climate resilience. Now, of course, this was all about the left and their religious [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1809.8600000000001s)]
*  obsession about global warming and climate change. The very last goal is about emergency [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1816.18s)]
*  preparedness. So you can see what the administration is prioritizing. How about this? How about if [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1822.18s)]
*  there's a natural disaster, like there's been in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1830.02s)]
*  and Florida, how about you help out every American in need? And how about you not steal the money from [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1836.66s)]
*  FEMA and give it to your unvetted illegal immigrants from 180 countries? Because their [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1843.22s)]
*  illegal immigrants seem to be prioritized and are way more important than the American people, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1849.38s)]
*  the people that are now currently suffering and not getting the help they need in spite of [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1855.7s)]
*  proclamations to the contrary. You have DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas saying, FEMA's running out of [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1860.66s)]
*  money and going bankrupt. Bankrupt? This has not been a busy hurricane season. This, after the FEMA [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1867.46s)]
*  directed more than $1 billion to pay for housing and food for Harris-Biden illegal immigrants, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1875.06s)]
*  because this story looks really bad for Democrats in charge, they are trying to just outright lie [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1882.42s)]
*  to you and pretend this is misinformation. This is a deep fake statement by conservatives. Well, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1889.6200000000001s)]
*  it's also on the FEMA website. It's completely truthful. It's completely real, just like Hunter [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1896.5s)]
*  Biden laptop was not misinformation, but very real. Democrats, the state-run media mob, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1902.42s)]
*  they simply lie. They push propaganda before elections. Here we go again. But in April press [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1908.98s)]
*  release from FEMA's own website, let me read it to you. It states the following. Today, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1914.74s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security through FEMA and the US Customs and Border Protection [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1920.18s)]
*  announced $300 million in grants through the Shelter and Services Program, which was authorized [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1925.22s)]
*  by Congress to support communities that are providing services to migrants. Let me interpret. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1931.06s)]
*  That means illegal alien, a word that Kamala wants you to be courageous enough to never use, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1937.14s)]
*  like radical Islamic terrorists. She wants you to be courageous and never use that word either. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1942.98s)]
*  It goes on. Additionally, DHS is announcing $340.9 million through the Shelter and Services [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1948.18s)]
*  Program and their competitive grant program to be allocated before the end of the fiscal year. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1956.02s)]
*  The last two years, over a billion dollars from FEMA to help Harris and Biden illegal immigrants. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1962.02s)]
*  It is not a deep fake. It's not misinformation. It is the truth. This is the Biden-Harris [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1970.18s)]
*  administration caught red-handed dedicating a massive amount of money that was supposed to be [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1976.1s)]
*  there for emergency relief for Americans in North Carolina, Georgia, and elsewhere to dispense to [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1982.6599999999999s)]
*  illegal immigrants while hurricane ravaged victims all over the country are left out to dry. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1989.6999999999998s)]
*  Again, it's about their priorities. And under Biden and Harris, the American people also seem [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=1995.6999999999998s)]
*  to come last. Now, earlier today, Sarah Carter, she was asking North Carolinians about FEMA's [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2001.22s)]
*  lackluster response. Here is what they had to say. Take a look. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2007.94s)]
*  It should have been immediate. It should have been immediate. And I'll tell you what, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2031.22s)]
*  thank God for the people of North Carolina, the residents, the fire chiefs. We have the two best [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2034.42s)]
*  fire chiefs in this area in the world. I mean, their response time from our citizens, our [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2041.06s)]
*  residents, they're supporting us. I mean, that's who's going to rebuild this community. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2045.94s)]
*  President Biden basically made a statement saying that people are getting what they need, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2050.42s)]
*  that they're happy. Are you getting what you need? Are you happy? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2056.02s)]
*  Absolutely not. We're getting what we need, but it's from people in Chimney Rock, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2059.06s)]
*  like not from the government. Like the basic necessities from your friends. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2064.82s)]
*  Yeah. But the bigger picture, no. Yeah. We're not happy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2069.2999999999997s)]
*  No. The message right now is just, just help. I mean, there's really not much more I can say. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2074.02s)]
*  We need help. We're American citizens. We're hard working. We do our jobs. We volunteer. We're part [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2079.46s)]
*  of the community, part of the team. And we just need support. I've never really asked [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2086.26s)]
*  for anything in my life. And now I'm asking. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKutnq1so&t=2092.5s)]
