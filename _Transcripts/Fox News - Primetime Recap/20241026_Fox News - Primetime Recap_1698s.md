# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 25, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w)
*  11 days away from Election Day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=0.0s)]
*  and Democrats feel like they need a therapist. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=2.58s)]
*  Democrats are, like, kind of a tire race, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=6.18s)]
*  and it will lapse into profound depression. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=9.72s)]
*  And a depressed party is not a winning party. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=13.06s)]
*  So anything that I can do to address [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  that kind of depression, I'm glad to do it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=19.36s)]
*  So if you're a Democrat and you're suffering [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=23.0s)]
*  from election anxiety, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=24.7s)]
*  James Carville's offering his services. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=26.36s)]
*  Hopefully not in that way, but he did say anything. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=29.36s)]
*  For the first time ever, Trump is tied [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=33.78s)]
*  going into Election Day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=36.2s)]
*  He always goes in down. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=38.0s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=40.12s)]
*  It's the tightest race in a half a century, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=41.94s)]
*  and behind the scenes, Democrats are worried [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=43.94s)]
*  she can't stretch herself across the finish line. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=46.82s)]
*  Little she does, says, or tries seems to move the needle. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=50.22s)]
*  They've been waiting for her to fully reveal herself [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=56.06s)]
*  to voters, but she hasn't. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  She's been a tease. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  At this point, Democrats are throwing their hands [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=63.04s)]
*  up in the air and saying, she is who she is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=65.36s)]
*  They're coming to grips with the fact [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  that Kamala has reached her full potential. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=71.1s)]
*  This version of Kamala is as good as it's ever gonna get. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  After the CNN town hall, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  reality slapped Democrats in the face. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=81.02s)]
*  Her performance last night was the last straw [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  for a lot of Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  No more. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=88.08s)]
*  The more she does it, the better she'll get. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=89.36s)]
*  The get-to-know-her phase, that's over. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  They've realized the country's not interested. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=95.38s)]
*  Just ask Mel Gibson. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=98.2s)]
*  A lot of people are... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=101.5s)]
*  I know what it'll be like if we let her in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=102.5s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, really? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=104.34s)]
*  And that ain't good. Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=105.7s)]
*  What, listen? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=107.56s)]
*  Miserable track record. Which one? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=108.56s)]
*  A calling track record. No. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  No policies to speak out. Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=112.18s)]
*  And the border, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=114.4s)]
*  And she's got the IQ of a fence post. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=115.5s)]
*  So it's not good. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  And Bill Clinton, not helping. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=119.8s)]
*  There is a sliver there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=122.92s)]
*  that has to make up their mind. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=125.4s)]
*  And to them, Kamala Harris just showed up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=127.36s)]
*  I mean, she was there as vice president, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=131.34s)]
*  and what they think of her [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=134.78s)]
*  largely depends on what they think of President Biden. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  But she is extremely vulnerable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=141.74s)]
*  More vulnerable than she deserves to be. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, if Bubba keeps this up, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  Democrats are gonna have to lock him up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=150.24s)]
*  in the basement with Joe. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  But Slick Willie's right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=153.86s)]
*  She's vulnerable. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  And the far left smelling blood in the water. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Progressives warned Harris [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=159.38s)]
*  must change your closing message as the election looms. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=161.8s)]
*  The Bernie bros are asking Harris, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=165.38s)]
*  can you stop campaigning with Liz Cheney? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  Liz Cheney. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=170.22s)]
*  And maybe campaign with AOC instead? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=172.22s)]
*  They're telling her, stop screaming about fascism [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=176.16s)]
*  and start talking about the bread and butter [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=179.66s)]
*  kitchen table issues [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=181.8s)]
*  that motivate working-class Democrats. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=183.22s)]
*  Some Democrats are concerned that you've pivoted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=187.0s)]
*  too far away from talking about the economy [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=188.96s)]
*  and really prioritizing that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  in these final days of the election, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  that you could end up losing some progressive voters [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=194.68s)]
*  and some working-class voters because of that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=197.4s)]
*  What do you say to those people, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=199.72s)]
*  especially ones who might be concerned that, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=200.88s)]
*  you know, doing a big closing argument speech [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=202.84s)]
*  in a place like the ellipse [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  may be leaning more into talking about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=206.76s)]
*  the threat of Trump to democracy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=208.98s)]
*  and not the threats that you see to the economy? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=211.28s)]
*  One of the things that I love about the American people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=215.42s)]
*  is, um, we can hold many thoughts at once. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=219.1s)]
*  Mm, that's deep. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=223.1s)]
*  Kamala's base is fracturing on the eve of the election [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=225.54s)]
*  because she's not talking about wages, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=229.5s)]
*  health care, and education, you know, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=231.7s)]
*  things Democrats used to stand for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=233.92s)]
*  before they got captured by the corporate class. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=236.54s)]
*  Morning Joe keeps telling her to talk about Hitler, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=239.82s)]
*  and she's following orders [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=242.62s)]
*  because that's what she's done her whole life. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=244.48s)]
*  She doesn't realize she can give orders now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  She doesn't have to just do what she's told. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=251.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, who's won more, millions more primary votes [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=254.26s)]
*  than Kamala has ever won, is warning the Democratic Party, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  we're gonna lose if we don't talk about the economy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=261.74s)]
*  But there's two problems. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=265.34s)]
*  One, Kamala can't talk about the economy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=266.74s)]
*  because she's the one who tanked it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=269.47999999999996s)]
*  And two, Kamala's afraid to be seen with Bernie. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=271.3s)]
*  She was more liberal than Bernie in the Senate, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=276.24s)]
*  but now she acts like they never met. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=279.02s)]
*  That tells you how much of a hoax Harris's candidacy is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrats are now wondering [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=285.4s)]
*  who'd be more responsible for a Harris loss, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=286.86s)]
*  Biden for dragging his feet, or Harris. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=289.88s)]
*  But there's plenty of blame to go around. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=293.5s)]
*  Everyone's responsible. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=296.0s)]
*  This is the second time the Democratic Party [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=298.5s)]
*  has circumvented democracy and chose. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=302.14s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=305.04s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton was chosen, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=307.1s)]
*  and she had Bruce Springsteen too, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=310.82s)]
*  and what happened to her? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=312.42s)]
*  And now we've chosen. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=313.72s)]
*  Kevin, Hillary Clinton won a primary, okay? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  She won a primary. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=317.76s)]
*  You may not like the fact that how the primary... [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=318.96s)]
*  Nobody could compete with her, even Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=320.08s)]
*  She won a primary, first of all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=322.08s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=323.8s)]
*  So did Kamala Harris win a primary? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=324.9s)]
*  Listen, we've talked about this before. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=326.4s)]
*  What's wrong about talking about it tonight [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=328.02s)]
*  after what you just saw? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=329.34s)]

*  Do you really think voters care [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=338.86s)]
*  about the intranessian primary process [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  of the Democratic Party? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  There is healthcare today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=344.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris is gonna lose [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  because Biden waited too long to step down? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=348.36s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  He didn't step down. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=352.92s)]
*  He backed out with a gun to his head. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=354.72s)]
*  The Democrats knew Biden was shot for years. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=357.24s)]
*  They could have primaried him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=360.74s)]
*  You know, the way things have been done [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  since our founding. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=364.74s)]

*  after Joe got whacked. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  The truth is, Biden and Kamala [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  are both probably gonna lose. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  They're both responsible for the last four years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=375.14s)]
*  Nobody can point to the last four years [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=378.74s)]
*  and say they deserve to be reelected. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=380.58s)]
*  Doesn't matter who you are. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=382.9s)]
*  It's not about Biden and Harris. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=384.3s)]
*  It's about what they did. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=387.28s)]
*  And now the Democrats are all in denial [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=389.58s)]
*  and demand every celebrity in America pop up on stage [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=392.46s)]
*  and sprinkle Kamala [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  with as much Hollywood magic as possible [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=397.5s)]
*  and just close their eyes and hope their dreams come true. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=400.38s)]
*  Tonight, we're hearing Kamala's gonna be onstage with Beyoncé. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=404.22s)]
*  But the media's seen this before. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=408.44s)]
*  With 11 days to go, I gotta tell you, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  to this reporter, it feels a little familiar, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=413.86s)]
*  because I remember these scenes from 2016 [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=416.2s)]
*  when Hillary rallied, Hillary Clinton rallied [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  in Philadelphia with Barack Obama [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=422.44s)]
*  and Bruce Springsteen. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=424.24s)]
*  That event was basically a victory rally [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=426.74s)]
*  that was held before all the votes were cast. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  And we all know how it turned out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=431.14s)]
*  You can't fuel a campaign with pop stars. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=433.78s)]
*  Campaigns are about connecting with people, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=437.44s)]
*  real people who have real problems. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=439.97999999999996s)]
*  These real moments between the politician and the people, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=443.02s)]
*  that's what makes or breaks a campaign. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  You can see one connects and the other doesn't. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=453.42s)]
*  I think it's time to stop it, all right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=454.44s)]
*  They're gonna put it here. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=457.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=459.44s)]

*  All right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=462.44s)]

*  the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=677.78s)]
*  I write about this in my book. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=682.98s)]
*  President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=685.18s)]
*  that neo-Nazis, fascists in America [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=688.18s)]
*  were lining up to essentially pledge their support [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  for the kind of government [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=697.48s)]
*  that they were seeing in Germany. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=698.98s)]
*  It may be a leap for some people, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=701.84s)]
*  and a lot of others may think, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=704.0s)]
*  I don't want to go there. I don't want to say that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=705.9s)]
*  But please, open your eyes to the danger [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=708.6s)]
*  that this man poses to our country. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=711.86s)]
*  There is no president in the modern era [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=716.24s)]
*  that has been as good a friend [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  and close an ally to Israel as Donald J. Trump. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=721.4s)]
*  Many presidents have promised to move the embassy [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=725.1s)]
*  from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump got it done. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=731.22s)]
*  Donald Trump recognized Israel's right [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=732.96s)]
*  to the Golan Heights and the West Bank. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=735.52s)]
*  And Israel's never had a better friend in the White House. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=738.22s)]
*  This kind of dishonest political rhetoric, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=741.38s)]
*  it is disgraceful, it is repulsive, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=744.26s)]
*  and frankly, it is dangerous. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=747.48s)]
*  Now, there are many deranged people, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=749.96s)]
*  unfortunately, in our country [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  that will listen to her words and to Carvel's words [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=754.2800000000001s)]
*  and to Kamala's words and Walz's words, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=757.98s)]
*  and they hear these words, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=761.74s)]
*  are they going to be inspired by them? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=763.44s)]
*  This is not new. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=765.54s)]
*  Now, take a look at your screen. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=766.74s)]
*  Democrats, they have been comparing Republicans [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=768.0s)]
*  to Nazis for decades. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=770.4s)]
*  They compared Mitt Romney to Hitler, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=771.94s)]
*  somebody they say they love now. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=774.44s)]
*  They did the same thing to John McCain, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=776.34s)]
*  who they used to love until he ran. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=778.08s)]
*  They didn't love him, then they loved him again. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  They did it to George W. Bush. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=781.94s)]
*  They did it to George H. W. Bush. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=783.6s)]
*  You know, one Democrat accused Ronald Reagan [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=786.72s)]
*  of trying to replace the Bill of Rights with Mein Kampf. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=788.96s)]
*  Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater in 1964, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=792.32s)]
*  all compared numerous times to Adolf Hitler, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=797.12s)]
*  and that is on the tip of the iceberg. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=800.5s)]
*  Everyone from Nikki Haley to Governor Ronda Santus [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  to Kamala's new friend Dick Cheney [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=805.72s)]
*  have all been compared to Nazis by Democrats, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=807.86s)]
*  but this time, it's a lot different. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=812.1s)]
*  Now, two people have already tried to assassinate [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump during this election cycle. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=817.38s)]
*  A Trump supporter was murdered, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=820.8399999999999s)]
*  others were seriously wounded, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=822.74s)]
*  and yet top Democrats, they are ramping up [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=824.7199999999999s)]
*  out of pure panic and a desire for political power, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  their rhetoric, with Kamala calling Trump a fascist, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=831.12s)]
*  as many of her surrogates are doing the same, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  her surrogates comparing him to Hitler, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=837.28s)]
*  and his and her supporters, you know, calling him Nazi. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=839.88s)]
*  Right now, there are delusional people that are out there, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  that are hearing these words. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=847.38s)]
*  We have foreign actors that we know about in this country, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=849.4799999999999s)]
*  including Iranian assassination squads [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=853.3199999999999s)]
*  who are targeting Donald Trump, targeting his family, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=856.4799999999999s)]
*  targeting his campaign team. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=859.78s)]
*  They know all of this. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  They get security briefings, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=864.62s)]
*  and they obviously do not care. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=867.0799999999999s)]
*  This insane, never-ending, absolutely dangerous rhetoric, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  they talk about Donald Trump's rhetoric. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=876.44s)]
*  What about their rhetoric? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=878.64s)]
*  It has the potential to put Donald Trump, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=880.38s)]
*  his family, his supporters, his campaign staff, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=883.44s)]
*  everybody around him, their lives at risk, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=887.24s)]
*  and Kamala, it needs to stop, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=890.5400000000001s)]
*  and it needs to stop immediately, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=893.58s)]
*  and you need to lead the way, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=896.0s)]
*  and you need to stop calling him a fascist. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=898.0s)]
*  And Hillary Clinton, well, you have no shame, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=900.34s)]
*  but you should be ashamed of yourself, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=903.08s)]
*  as well as everybody else that is out there using these terms. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=905.08s)]
*  Repulsive, reckless, dangerous, beyond irresponsible. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=909.0s)]
*  In a rare move, Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=913.98s)]
*  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=916.08s)]
*  or Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  released a joint letter demanding that Harris, quote, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=919.98s)]
*  end the dangerous rhetoric. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=923.7s)]
*  This letter continues, quote, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=926.16s)]
*  we call on Vice President Harris [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=928.1s)]
*  to take these threats seriously, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=930.3s)]
*  stop escalating the threat environment, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=933.04s)]
*  help ensure that President Trump has the necessary resources, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  they've been denied many times, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=939.64s)]
*  to be protected from those threats. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=941.4s)]
*  But if Kamala needs even more evidence [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=944.04s)]
*  that her vile remarks have crossed the line, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=945.96s)]
*  well, maybe she should listen [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  to an actual survivor of the Holocaust. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=950.06s)]
*  In this case, a 94-year-old man [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=953.0s)]
*  who was nine years old when taken by the Nazis, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=955.86s)]
*  whose parents were murdered under Adolf Hitler [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=959.2s)]
*  in Nazi Germany. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=963.14s)]
*  Listen. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=964.94s)]
*  I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=966.54s)]
*  in a thousand lifetimes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=970.7s)]
*  For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=973.1s)]
*  is the worst thing I've ever heard [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=978.04s)]
*  in my 75 years living in the United States. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=983.06s)]
*  What does Kamala Harris have to say for herself? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=988.9s)]
*  What about her supporters? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  By the way, weren't they supposed to be running [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=993.9399999999999s)]
*  a joyful campaign? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=996.24s)]
*  Well, tonight, there is good news from all of this. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=998.0s)]
*  This election, once again, has exposed [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1002.0999999999999s)]
*  the radicalism, extremism, the true colors [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1005.86s)]
*  of this modern Democratic Party for all to see. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1009.22s)]
*  They don't care about democracy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1013.6600000000001s)]
*  They don't care about the quality of life here in America, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1016.26s)]
*  or maybe they'd be talking about that every day. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1019.6s)]
*  Or even global peace. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1022.32s)]
*  They want to lecture Israel how to fight the people [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  that are dedicated to their destruction [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1027.76s)]
*  that killed the equivalent of 40,000 Americans [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1030.3s)]
*  in a single day. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1033.26s)]
*  You know, they only care about power, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  and they'll shred the so-called norms in any way, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1037.08s)]
*  in a heartbeat, as they lecture the rest of the country [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
*  about civility, like they lecture the country [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1043.72s)]
*  about the dangers of fossil fuels [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1046.56s)]
*  while they themselves are flying around the world [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1049.1599999999999s)]
*  in private jets with a massive carbon footprint. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1051.56s)]
*  Now, they're gonna toss out millions of primary votes [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1054.96s)]
*  and stall a different candidate. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1057.26s)]
*  Oh, threat to democracy? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1059.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1061.36s)]
*  They're gonna get rid of the filibuster, pack the courts. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1062.52s)]
*  They'll try to throw their chief political rivals in jail. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1065.04s)]
*  We've watched the weaponization of the DOJ. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1068.08s)]
*  We've watched lawfare unfold. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1070.42s)]
*  We have covered this now for the last number of years. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1072.48s)]

*  he was like your 87-year-old senile grandfather. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1516.52s)]
*  Yeah, I wish. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1520.48s)]
*  At a New York event the following month, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1522.48s)]
*  another observer says, quote, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1524.48s)]
*  he never completed a sentence. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1526.48s)]
*  He would start to talk about something, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1528.48s)]
*  jump somewhere else. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1530.48s)]
*  He told the same story three times [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1531.48s)]
*  in exactly the same way, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1532.48s)]
*  and it meandered so much. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1534.48s)]
*  Frankly, my impression was there were times [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1536.48s)]
*  it was though we didn't exist. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1538.48s)]
*  He was just rambling and talking [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1541.48s)]
*  as to what came into his head. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1543.48s)]
*  Well, that sounds familiar. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1545.48s)]
*  But... [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1547.44s)]
*  Of course, up until the debate disaster, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1549.44s)]
*  the White House and the media all insisted [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1552.44s)]
*  Biden was better than ever. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1554.44s)]
*  Sharpest attack, running rings around staffers, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1556.44s)]
*  one-third his age. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1558.44s)]
*  Rumor had it he even beat Randy Winegarden's record [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1560.44s)]
*  for the deadlift. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1562.44s)]
*  Yet we could see with our own eyes [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1567.44s)]
*  that it was bullsh... [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1569.44s)]
*  And the whole time Woodward knew [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1570.44s)]
*  and he didn't tell us [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1572.44s)]
*  because he wanted a second chance. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1573.44s)]
*  He knew and he didn't tell us [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1575.4s)]
*  because he wanted to sell a lousy book. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1577.4s)]
*  Usually they have journalist standards that low. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1579.4s)]
*  You have to work here. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1582.4s)]
*  But imagine what would have happened [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1589.4s)]
*  if Woodward had reported on this 16 months ago. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1591.4s)]
*  Imagine if the Dems had been forced [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1594.4s)]
*  to rip off the Band-Aid [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1596.4s)]
*  and admit the old man was finished. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1597.4s)]
*  Maybe the DNC would have found [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1599.4s)]
*  a better candidate altogether. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1600.4s)]
*  Like this. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1602.4s)]
*  Or this. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1604.36s)]
*  It would have been painful for them, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1609.36s)]
*  but not nearly as painful [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1611.36s)]
*  as the past three months. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1612.36s)]
*  But remember, not only did Kamala Harris [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1614.36s)]
*  help engineer Biden's removal from the ticket, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1616.36s)]
*  she still left him in place [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1619.36s)]
*  as part of the cover-up. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1620.36s)]
*  She didn't introduce the 25th Amendment. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1622.36s)]
*  So you not only had [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1624.36s)]
*  an unelected awful candidate installed [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1625.36s)]
*  onto the ticket, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1627.36s)]
*  you had a decrepit and capable leader [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1628.36s)]
*  allowed to stay [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1630.36s)]
*  and run the most vital country in the world. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1631.36s)]
*  Fraught with tenuous relationships [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1633.32s)]
*  with other superpowers. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1635.32s)]
*  Thanks, Bob. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1637.32s)]
*  This raises another question. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1639.32s)]
*  If the 25th Amendment [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1640.32s)]
*  was threatened but not invoked, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1641.32s)]
*  why? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1643.32s)]
*  Well, forget Joe. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1644.32s)]
*  It would have been a disaster for Kamala. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1646.32s)]
*  Given the problems with Russia, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1648.32s)]
*  China, the Middle East, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1649.32s)]
*  they couldn't let the country see her [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1650.32s)]
*  as president for six remaining months. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1652.32s)]
*  But Woodward kept Biden's decline [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1654.32s)]
*  into wraps, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1656.32s)]
*  which led to the coup, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1657.32s)]
*  installing Kamala without a primary. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1659.32s)]
*  And once you betray [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1661.32s)]
*  Americans in the most basic regard, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1662.28s)]
*  it becomes that much easier [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1664.28s)]
*  to betray them in everything else. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1665.28s)]
*  So if you're a Dem [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1667.28s)]
*  and you want to get mad at somebody, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1668.28s)]
*  it's not Trump. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1670.28s)]
*  It's Woodward [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1672.28s)]
*  and the rest of the media [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1673.28s)]
*  who covered for this charade. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1674.28s)]
*  Bob could have saved you [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1676.28s)]
*  from all of this horrible fate, Dems, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1677.28s)]
*  but that wouldn't have made [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1680.28s)]
*  the bestseller list. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1681.28s)]
*  For the most compelling analysis, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1692.28s)]
*  you will not get it [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1694.28s)]
*  anywhere else. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G5AsrKCK4w&t=1695.28s)]
