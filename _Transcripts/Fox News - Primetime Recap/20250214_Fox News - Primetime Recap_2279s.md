# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 13, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4)
*  There's been a break-in at the IRS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=0.0s)]
*  Doze just kicked in the door and ordered executives [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2.0s)]
*  to put their hands where they can see them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=4.5s)]
*  There was an ultimatum. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=6.5s)]
*  We can do this the easy way or the hard way. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=8.0s)]
*  Doze workers arrived today, Gavin Kleiger, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=11.0s)]
*  and others arrived today at the IRS. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=13.5s)]
*  Do you expect to close the IRS, or what are you expecting? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=15.5s)]
*  No, I don't expect it, but... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=19.0s)]
*  But I think... So I think that the Internal Revenue Service [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=21.0s)]
*  will be looked at like everybody else. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=25.0s)]
*  Just about everybody's gonna be looked at, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=27.0s)]
*  so it's, uh... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=29.0s)]
*  They're doing a hell of a job. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=31.0s)]
*  It's an amazing job they're doing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=33.0s)]
*  And, you know, that force is building these... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=35.0s)]
*  I call it the force of supergeniuses, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=37.0s)]
*  but it's building. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=39.0s)]
*  And, you know, they go up and they talk to some of the people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=41.0s)]
*  about certain deals, and the people get all tongue-tied. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=43.0s)]
*  They can't talk, because these people get it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=45.0s)]
*  They're very smart people. We need smart people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=48.0s)]
*  Big Balls is making bureaucrats tongue-tied. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=51.0s)]
*  What's this contract for? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=53.0s)]
*  Uh... Terminated. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=55.0s)]
*  Next up is NASA. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=58.0s)]
*  Elon's nerd army's reviewing their spending. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=60.0s)]
*  I have a feeling we're gonna find NASA [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=63.0s)]
*  isn't all about outer space. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=65.0s)]
*  If agencies can't justify their headcount, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=67.0s)]
*  Musk's planning on slashing every department by 30 to 40%. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=69.0s)]
*  If Doge finds an unused federal building, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=74.0s)]
*  they're gonna sell it and put the profits in the piggy bank. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=77.0s)]
*  Trump has his eyes on 14,000 vacant federal buildings. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=80.0s)]
*  So if you want to live in an 80,000-square-foot estate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=85.0s)]
*  at the foot of the Potomac that's been collecting cobwebs [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=87.0s)]
*  for six decades, put in a bid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=89.0s)]
*  The government has more money than it knows what to do with. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=92.0s)]
*  We just found out we're funding Palestinian hip-hop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=95.0s)]
*  I uncovered over $3 million to a rap artist in Gaza [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=100.0s)]
*  producing anti-Israel, anti-Semitic songs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=106.0s)]
*  Is that the best use of American taxpayer dollars? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=111.0s)]
*  I would venture not. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=114.0s)]
*  And here's who got the money. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=116.0s)]
*  My Magaza's getting bombed, but nobody's saying it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=119.0s)]
*  I'm kinda getting scared now, but nobody's getting it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=122.0s)]
*  See, they terrorize my days, but saying that I'm the terrorist [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=125.0s)]
*  How can I be the terrorist? Do you know a terrorist? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=128.0s)]
*  It's all my life I've been terrorized, so I can't be the terrorist [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=131.0s)]
*  But sometimes I wish I was aborted [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=134.0s)]
*  Ripped out of my mother's wounds [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=136.0s)]
*  I know I'm sick in the morgue, but they cannibals, they animals [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=138.0s)]
*  They're grilling our organs, Auschwitz reincarnated [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=141.0s)]
*  Arnaded brought back to life [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=144.0s)]
*  By the victims that were burned by the Nazi life [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=146.0s)]
*  We sent $3 million to Kanye West Bank, his organization. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=149.0s)]
*  We're paying Palestinians to rap about the bombs we sold BB. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=154.0s)]
*  American taxpayers are like bookies. We're on both sides of every deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=158.0s)]
*  We spent $20 billion to freak out a bunch of pets. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=163.0s)]
*  Injecting puppies with cocaine, staging hamster fight clubs, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=168.0s)]
*  putting dead turtles on treadmills. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=171.0s)]
*  Cats have marbles shoved up their rectums in our electroshock [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=173.0s)]
*  to make them defecate in constipation experiments. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=176.0s)]
*  Examining the effects of party drugs on animals injected with testosterone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=179.0s)]
*  Who are we buying the cocaine from? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=184.0s)]
*  I can get a gram from Gutfeld and give it to a rookie. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=187.0s)]
*  Why does that cost so much? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=190.0s)]
*  I can find a dead turtle in a pond, throw it on a treadmill, hit start, watch it keel over. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=192.0s)]
*  That's free. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=197.0s)]
*  A hamster fight club? Did they hire Joe Rogan to announce the fight? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=199.0s)]
*  $20 billion is what Trump asked Congress for to build the border wall. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=205.0s)]
*  We did this instead. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=210.0s)]
*  We're also learning through the New York Post, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=212.0s)]
*  the Department of Health and Human Services wasted $22 billion [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=215.0s)]
*  buying migrants cars and homes and giving them seed money to start businesses. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=219.0s)]
*  Now Jose has a Cadillac, a bungalow, a side hustle and a credit score of $740. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=226.0s)]
*  Did we buy cars and homes for folks in North Carolina after Helene? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=232.0s)]
*  And Biden's EPA couldn't get the money out the door fast enough. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=237.0s)]
*  An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=242.0s)]
*  featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=246.0s)]
*  tossing gold bars off the Titanic, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=250.0s)]
*  rushing to get billions of your tax dollars out the door before Inauguration Day. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=253.0s)]
*  The gold bars were tax dollars, and tossing them off the Titanic [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=258.0s)]
*  meant the Biden administration knew they were wasting it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=264.0s)]
*  Right before Christmas, Biden's EPA gave the Climate United Fund $7 billion. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=268.0s)]
*  This climate fund looks like a slush fund to funnel cash to Joe's donors for pet projects. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=276.0s)]
*  We looked to see who ran the fund and went to the board of directors page. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=282.0s)]
*  They scrubbed it. It's all gone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=286.0s)]
*  They took the money and ran. That's why Trump calls it the Green New Scam. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=288.0s)]
*  Doge is saving over a billion bucks a day chasing this trash down, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=293.0s)]
*  and Democrats are acting like they're getting carpet bombed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=296.0s)]
*  What does that mean when an unelected billionaire can waltz into our agencies [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=300.0s)]
*  and slash and burn the whole thing to the ground like a Taliban terrorist? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=306.0s)]
*  Only a Democrat thinks defunding cocaine puppies is terrorism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=312.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton fired almost 400,000 federal bureaucrats. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=316.0s)]
*  No one called him a terrorist. We called him Slick Willie. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=321.0s)]
*  And Trump and Elon are offering very generous buyouts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=325.0s)]
*  75,000 workers have already took him up on it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=328.0s)]
*  The retirement cave hostages are working 24-7 processing all this paperwork. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=332.0s)]
*  Trump's doing exactly what Obama wished he did. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=337.0s)]
*  One of the commitments that I made the American people was that we would do a better job here in Washington [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=341.0s)]
*  in rooting out wasteful spending. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=348.0s)]
*  We don't need to wait for Congress in order to do something about wasteful spending that's out there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=351.0s)]
*  Cutting waste, making government more efficient is something that leaders in both parties have worked on. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=357.0s)]
*  We haven't seen as much action out of Congress as we'd like, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=363.0s)]
*  and that's why we launched on our own initiative the campaign to cut waste. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=366.0s)]
*  So Obama said he didn't need to wait for Congress to cut waste, fraud and abuse. That's funny. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=371.0s)]
*  The New York Times has always covered government waste under Obama, Clinton, Bush, everybody. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=376.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the Times reported the federal government loses between $233 to $521 billion a year to fraud. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=383.0s)]
*  And in the same week, the Times writes this headline, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=393.0s)]
*  Musk asserts without proof that bureaucracy is rife with fraud. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=396.0s)]
*  Without proof, the Times just reported the proof. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=400.0s)]
*  And it's based on the government's own accounting. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=404.0s)]
*  This is why no one trusts the media. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=406.0s)]
*  Finally, Trump hired a rocket scientist with an IT department to root out the fraud, and the Democrats are against it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=409.0s)]
*  Who the hell voted for Mr. Musk? Who the hell voted for, excuse the phrase, a guy who calls himself Big Balls? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=416.0s)]
*  No one voted for Musk. So what? No one voted for Fauci either. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=423.0s)]
*  You voted for the president, and he appoints people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=427.0s)]
*  And why are we even having this conversation? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=431.0s)]
*  Trump ran on reform and won on it with Musk at his side. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=433.0s)]
*  And Musk is doing everything under a national spotlight. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=438.0s)]
*  He's not hiding in the shadows like Soros financing open borders and crime waves. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=442.0s)]
*  These people are never going to learn. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=447.0s)]
*  After getting humiliated by the Russia hoax, Maddow's back to spreading conspiracies. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=450.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has apparently somehow convinced the United States government, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=456.0s)]

*  quote, armored Tesla production units. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=472.0s)]
*  Isn't it great and definitely not at all illegal or profoundly corrupt? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=476.0s)]
*  Definitely not ripping us all off to pay themselves, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=480.0s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't give that contract to Elon Musk. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=484.0s)]
*  Joe Biden gave it to him. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=488.0s)]
*  Even liberals are calling Maddow out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=490.0s)]
*  The $400 million armored Tesla story is a fake scandal in a sea of real graft and horror. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=493.0s)]
*  And there's a difference between Musk winning competitive bids [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=499.0s)]
*  to provide armored trucks to diplomats in dangerous countries [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=502.0s)]

*  The State Department asked for them, unlike trans musicals or Sesame Street in Iraq. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=521.0s)]
*  No one asked for that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=526.0s)]
*  Most of the country wants that stuff cut, and Democrats should too. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=528.0s)]
*  People want the government to work better. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=532.0s)]
*  They believe that Mr. Musk, one of the most extraordinary entrepreneurs in human history, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=535.0s)]
*  who does not fail at just about anything, they want him to do this, most Americans. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=540.0s)]
*  They wanted Trump. They elected him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=545.0s)]
*  Democrats are only focused on one thing right now, Mr. Musk. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=547.0s)]
*  The fact of the matter, he's quite popular. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=550.0s)]
*  He has the largest platform in human history, which is, of course, Twitter slash X. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=552.0s)]
*  And I think we're missing the boat as Democrats, and Democrats are being steamrolled. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=557.0s)]
*  This isn't just about money. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=561.0s)]
*  It's about people behind the scenes abusing power they don't have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=563.0s)]

*  Doge is a blessing from the heavens above. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=576.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal puts it this way, quote, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=580.0s)]
*  Elon Musk's glorious rampage through official Washington is like something from a dream. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=583.0s)]
*  Even Ronald Reagan, the great apostle of smaller government, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=588.0s)]
*  couldn't achieve in eight years what Mr. Musk has done in three and a half weeks. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=592.0s)]
*  The billionaire businessman is less apostle than a venging angel. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=597.0s)]
*  The Department of Government Efficiency is the change we've been waiting for. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=602.0s)]
*  The Democrats got caught cold in the middle of a bank heist. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=606.0s)]
*  Doge walked into the vault. Democrats were stuffing wads of cash in their bags. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=610.0s)]
*  And they're mad that Musk is telling them to put the bags down. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=614.0s)]
*  The bank robbers aren't the victims here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=618.0s)]

*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight it is full steam ahead at the White House. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=622.0s)]
*  So far 16 Trump cabinet nominees have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=627.0s)]
*  This includes the newly sworn in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Roberts, sorry, Robert Kennedy Jr. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=632.0s)]
*  on the heels, of course, of Tulsi Gabbard yesterday. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=638.0s)]
*  The Make America Healthy Again movement is now an official part of your federal government. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=641.0s)]
*  And by the way, don't worry, your measles, your polio vaccines will still be available at McDonald's and KFC. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=646.0s)]
*  They will not be closing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=654.0s)]
*  But the Trump White House, by the way, is making big changes across the federal government. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=656.0s)]
*  The executive branch is no longer on cruise control. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=661.0s)]
*  We actually have a president taking the reins and taking it back from these unelected, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=664.0s)]
*  self-important, far left, deep state bureaucrats that nobody knows their names from the Washington swamp. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=670.0s)]
*  And a lot of them, bye bye, they're leaving. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=676.0s)]
*  Of course, this has major implications both here at home and abroad. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=678.0s)]
*  We're going to analyze Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs in just a moment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=682.0s)]
*  Kind of sounds fair, doesn't it? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=687.0s)]
*  Did you know Canada taxes us? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=688.0s)]
*  Did you know the European Union has high taxes on us? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=690.0s)]
*  Did you know India has high taxes on us and tariffs? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=693.0s)]
*  Why don't we do the same to them? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=697.0s)]
*  Or they stop what they're doing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=699.0s)]
*  But that's not the only big news from the White House today. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=701.0s)]
*  President Trump is ready to negotiate peace in Europe and lead a new era of communication, accountability and peace, hopefully worldwide. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=704.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=712.0s)]
*  Do you want to have Russia back to the G7, sir? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=713.0s)]
*  I'd love to have them back. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=716.0s)]
*  I think it was a mistake to throw them out. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=717.0s)]
*  Look, it's not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=719.0s)]
*  It was the G8. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=722.0s)]
*  And you know, I said, what are you doing? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=723.0s)]
*  You guys, all you talk about is Russia and you they should be sitting at the table. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=725.0s)]
*  I think Putin would love to be back. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=730.0s)]
*  Obama and a couple of other people made a mistake and they got Russia out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=732.0s)]
*  It's very possible that if that was the G8, you wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=737.0s)]
*  And if I was president, you definitely wouldn't have had the problem with Ukraine. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=742.0s)]
*  Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=745.0s)]
*  We were talking about denuclearized, denuclearized and President Putin and I agreed that we were going to do it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=747.0s)]
*  In a very big way. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=754.0s)]
*  There's no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=755.0s)]
*  We already have so many you could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=760.0s)]
*  And here we are building new nuclear weapons and they're building nuclear weapons and China's building new nuclear weapons. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=766.0s)]
*  It's week four of Shock It On. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=773.0s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, the war in Europe started under President Joe Biden, frankly, the worst president in modern American history. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=776.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=782.0s)]
*  I think Biden is incompetent and I think when he said that they could join NATO, I thought that was a very stupid thing to say. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=783.0s)]
*  I thought when he said, well, it depends if it's a minor incursion. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=791.0s)]
*  In other words, it's OK if Russia does a minor incursion. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=795.0s)]
*  I thought that was a very foolish thing to say. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=799.0s)]
*  The other thing that got it started was how badly Milly and these stupid people, bad jobs, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=802.0s)]
*  people, bad generals, how badly they did with Afghanistan. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=811.0s)]
*  I was going to pull out, but we were pulling out with dignity and strength and we were going to take our equipment with us and everything else. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=815.0s)]
*  They are. I mean, what they're doing is what they did with that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=823.0s)]
*  I think Putin looked at that mess and he said, wow, this is a great time. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=828.0s)]
*  I'm going to go and this should have been done by Biden years ago. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=832.0s)]
*  This should have never been allowed to happen. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=835.0s)]
*  I know he's a friend of yours. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=837.0s)]
*  He's a friend of CNN. That's why nobody watches CNN anymore because they have no no credibility. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=839.0s)]
*  The president's right, Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=845.0s)]
*  Those days, thankfully, are over. Peace through strength is back. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=848.0s)]
*  America's newfound strength abroad doesn't just extend to our foes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=851.0s)]
*  Trump is also not afraid to hold our allies accountable, including our neighbor to the north. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=856.0s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=861.0s)]
*  So I think Canada is going to be a very serious contender to be our fifty first state. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=862.0s)]
*  There was obviously a delay in implementing those tariffs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=869.0s)]
*  I spoke to Governor Trudeau on numerous occasions and we'll see what happens. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=876.0s)]
*  But it just sets up so good for them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=881.0s)]
*  Look, the people would pay much less tax than they're paying right now that have perfect military protection. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=883.0s)]
*  They don't have any military protection because they essentially because and you take a look at what's going on out there. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=889.0s)]
*  You have Russian ships, you have China ships, you have Chinese ships, you have a lot of ships out there. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=895.0s)]
*  And, you know, people are in danger. This is a different world today. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=902.0s)]
*  It's a different world that they need our protection. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=905.0s)]
*  By the way, just just stop for a second. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=908.0s)]
*  And it kind of refreshing. We have a president not predetermined question. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=911.0s)]
*  Let me go to Joe from Reuters. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=915.0s)]
*  Joe, read the question that we pre approved. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=921.0s)]
*  I mean, kind of refreshing, extemporaneous. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=924.0s)]
*  The president giving access to the media. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=927.0s)]
*  You think they'd be grateful, but they're not. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=929.0s)]
*  But anyway, one way or another, Canada's leaders, they're going to have to learn that we do have all the leverage. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=932.0s)]
*  They need to stop the tariffs they currently have on American products. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=937.0s)]
*  They need to pay their fair share to NATO. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=941.0s)]
*  They need to secure their borders. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=943.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump is determined to hold hold Canada and all countries to a high standard to restore fairness in our agreements to put America first. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=945.0s)]
*  Now, that's what these countries are doing. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=955.0s)]
*  This isn't just about other countries. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=957.0s)]
*  The president is also holding our very own government accountable. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=959.0s)]
*  Every single department is now facing an intensive review, something that's been long overdue. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=963.0s)]
*  Bad actors, unproductive workers are being shown the door. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=968.0s)]
*  Seventy five thousand federal employees. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=972.0s)]
*  I promise you won't miss them. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=975.0s)]
*  Have accepted the president's buyout offer and will no longer be employed and paid for by you. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=977.0s)]
*  The taxpayers as of October the first and just this week, Donald Trump also terminated Biden's climate core, which planned to hire twenty thousand climate obsessed radical leftist communist, you know, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=983.0s)]

*  Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1026.0s)]
*  Look, the Department of Education is a big con job. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1028.0s)]

*  Cost per pupil. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1039.0s)]
*  So we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1041.0s)]
*  But we're ranked number 40 Norway, Denmark, Sweden. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1044.0s)]
*  I hate to say it, China, as big as it is, it's ranked in the top five. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1050.0s)]

*  We're ranked number 40. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1057.0s)]

*  Elon Musk, his team at Doge, they are uncovering a massive amount of waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1083.0s)]

*  They're buying cars for illegals and help out with their home loans and their startups. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1099.0s)]
*  And while the Biden administration worked to fast track the lives of illegals, putting them above all of you, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1104.0s)]
*  everyone else is forced to navigate a sea of rules and regulations to get anything done. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1110.0s)]
*  Take a look at this chart for every single law passed in the U.S. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1115.0s)]
*  Bureaucrats in D.C. created over 18 new regulations across the government. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1119.0s)]
*  There are nearly 100 million words spelling out each and every regulation. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1124.0s)]
*  That is the definition of insanity. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1130.0s)]
*  That is a bureaucracy that is spun way out of control until now. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1132.0s)]
*  Almost no one has critically regulated America's all powerful, ever growing federal bureaucracy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1136.0s)]
*  This may be the only opportunity in our lifetime to truly limit the size, the scope, the influence, the reach of government in every aspect of your life. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1143.0s)]
*  We need to take advantage of this moment. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1154.0s)]
*  But instead of speaking truth to power, many on the left, they're just desperate to defend mother government above all else. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1156.0s)]
*  For example, over at MSDNC, conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow stoking the flames of hysteria, you know, peddling another lie, another hoax and a complete distortion. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1163.0s)]
*  This time, Elon Musk is the target. Let's watch. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1174.0s)]
*  As the top campaign donor to U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk has apparently somehow convinced the United States government, specifically the United States Department of State, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1178.0s)]
*  that the taxpayers of the United States of America should spend $400 million buying, quote, armored Tesla production units. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1189.0s)]
*  You got armored Tesla vehicles. Donald Trump's corrupt. This is terrible. This is a conflict of interest. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1203.0s)]
*  Here are two very critical facts that she omitted in that conspiracy theory. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1211.0s)]
*  Somehow she failed to mention first the Tesla procurement plan. That started under Joe Biden, Rachel, not Donald Trump. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1215.0s)]
*  Number two, this plan was canceled by President Trump. As always, MSDNC, Maddow lying, deceiving their audience. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1225.0s)]
*  They haven't learned a thing and they do it for political gain and frankly a paycheck. And she's not the only left wing zealot pushing conspiracy theories. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1234.0s)]
*  Delaware Senator Chris Coons put this dramatic post on ex blaming Musk and Trump for allowing critical medicines to expire in a warehouse. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1242.0s)]
*  They're horrible people unable to reach Africa because of the of USAID, you know, quotes. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1251.0s)]
*  Two problems with that tweet. One, as Musk has pointed out, giving shipping routes and distribution times that medicine needed to be shipped months ago if it was truly about to expire. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1258.0s)]
*  Number two, you kind of zoom in on the box. Take a closer look. Medicine appears to have an expiration date. That date is 2027. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1270.0s)]
*  Whoopsie daisy. Anyway, so Trump and Musk do important work. Democrats have nothing to offer other than their daily temper tantrums. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1281.0s)]
*  They're screaming, yelling hysteria. Their lies, they're fear mongering. Their conspiracy theories. Soon it will be calls for impeachment. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1289.0s)]
*  They, you know, of course have been turning to the courts to lend a helping hand. And now even that is failing. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1296.0s)]
*  Two courts just ruled in Donald Trump's favor, allowing his federal employee buyout plan to move forward and restoring Trump's ability to freeze federal funding. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1302.0s)]
*  B minus. Happy Thursday, everyone. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1317.0s)]
*  So Attorney General Pam Bondi has sued New York leaders, including Governor Hokel, for prioritizing illegal immigration. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1321.0s)]
*  Hokel claims these migrants are necessary for the state. After all, we need them to mow the lawns, trim the hedges and weed-whack her eyebrows. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1328.0s)]
*  Bondi also removed a large framed photo of Joe Biden from the DOJ. It's the most Biden has moved in the last four years. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yes. Top Democrat fundraiser says Hunter Biden, who has no security clearance, was sitting in on high level meetings. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1351.0s)]
*  Off the record, sources have confirmed Hunter's presence at the meetings by accurately describing his penis. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1360.0s)]
*  I could have said scrotum. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1370.0s)]
*  I could have said scrotum. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1371.0s)]
*  RFK Jr. was confirmed as Health and Human Services. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1374.0s)]
*  He was confirmed as Health and Human Services Secretary in a 52 to 48 vote, despite a protest by a group of local activists. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1382.0s)]
*  A White House official says Canada becoming a 51st state is still on the table. One sticking point, however, neither country wants Drake. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1391.0s)]
*  An Illinois Democratic lawmaker says manufacturing is a field with fewer women because the word manufacturing includes man and it makes it sound like a god. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1408.0s)]
*  Great. Now explain to me why so many women menstruate. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1422.0s)]
*  A U.S. judge has cleared the way for thousands of federal workers to take Trump's buyout offer, which will require them to come into the office to do it, which means they'll have to finally buy pants. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1434.0s)]
*  As they're at home. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1447.0s)]
*  Speaking of Jeffrey, to Ben has joined the New York Times opinion section. Now you remember him as the CNN anchor who was caught masturbating on a Zoom call, which explains the welcome gift he received from his coworkers. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1448.0s)]
*  And that's not for lubrication, Jeffrey. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1471.0s)]
*  So it's clear that right now the Democrats need some help, a little guidance. Yet the Dems could learn a thing from the late night king. First, the old concept. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1473.0s)]
*  Hold your applause for the bedroom. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1484.0s)]
*  First, the old concept of how to defeat Trump is dead. It's not Trump you need to defeat. It's yourselves. Before you complain about the neighbor's yard, you need to clean up yours first. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1489.0s)]
*  Without asking illegals to do it for you. Your world has changed forever. And sorry, freaks, making our ears bleed won't help. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1500.0s)]
*  Which side are you on? Which side are you on? We'll fight against George. We'll fight Elon Musk. No Helenskab within our walls. We'll fight from dawn to dusk. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1509.0s)]
*  Which side are you on? Which side are you on? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1528.0s)]
*  Which side am I on? I'm on the side that's now deaf. Sounded like someone threw a bag of cats into a woodchipper. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1538.0s)]
*  Migrants just saw this and ran back to Venezuela. But it's ironic the party that is so pro-transitioning can't seem to transition themselves. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1547.0s)]
*  Right now the Dems are behaving like bratty kids who've had their toy taken away. And that toy is power. They lost the government, the media, the American people. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1558.0s)]
*  Although they still got the view. But how will they feed the cast without billions from USAID? So the reaction seems to be why not lose our minds too? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1567.0s)]
*  Tuesday the New York Times ran an article that was such a piece of s***. I had to put some Victor's Vicks vapor rub under my nose while reading it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1579.0s)]
*  Victor's. What's wrong with me? It says quote, in oval office must says without proof that bureaucracy is rife with fraud. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1590.0s)]
*  But as Michael Schellenberger pointed out, even the Biden administration had listed the billions that America loses to fraud. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1599.0s)]
*  Any real journalists could have found this out if they had stopped huffing their own ass gas. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1606.0s)]
*  But with the daily revelations from Doge, the Times editors had no choice but to backtrack and change the headline. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1611.0s)]
*  And now their problem seems to be that Musk's claims are too broad. Perhaps they were hoping no one would notice their mistake. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1621.0s)]
*  Like that time I once robbed my friend's baby. When I was at the Grand Canyon. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1630.0s)]
*  The cracks were also showing over at CNN where guests Chris Sununu tried to educate the albino Ron Burgundy on this very topic. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1636.0s)]
*  Some of the details that have come out, like the, you know, $59 million spent on luxury hotels, it's actually not the female money that was used for migrants. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1646.0s)]
*  That was female money for migrants. That's OK now. No, I'm not saying it's OK. I'm not saying it's OK. Don't put words in my mouth. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1657.0s)]
*  Would you stop that? Would you stop that process? Don't be a d***. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1663.0s)]
*  Such language. Thank goodness no one under 85 was watching. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1669.0s)]
*  But it's clear for Libs the world has gone off the rails. I mean, since when has Anderson Cooper come out against d***? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1676.0s)]
*  But. I mean, he hangs around Andy Cohen. I'm just saying they're jerks. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1684.0s)]
*  But the left has yet to realize there's no going back. They can't fix this because we're all so much wiser now. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1694.0s)]
*  We've seen the ugliness firsthand. We can't go back to a government that wastes all our money on d***. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1700.0s)]
*  We can't return to a legacy media that manipulated truth and pushed lies to harm Trump supporters, our country, our justice system and our kids. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1705.0s)]
*  A government where FEMA tells their staff to avoid Trump supporters homes after a hurricane because the legacy news falsely painted Trump supporters as violent white supremacists. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1713.0s)]
*  What are those jerk offs going to do the perp walk? So we're not doing that again. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1724.0s)]
*  Hell, all French kiss Whippy Goldberg after she eats an entire red onion before I go back. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1729.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1735.0s)]
*  And it's no longer a left versus right thing. It's before and after. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1738.0s)]
*  And the past is like a dead lover. The best you can do is visit the gravesite and mourn, which is easy for me because it's under my hot tub. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1743.0s)]
*  But ultimately you got to move on. Eventually you have to see the world for what it is and not what the voices in your head tell you it is. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1752.0s)]
*  Because one of the great things about Doge exposing everything is that we're learning that it's possible to change. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1759.0s)]
*  And even the future, the same old government malfeasance returns. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1764.0s)]
*  We can remember how Trump saved the economy in 2025. They cut a trillion in a year. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1768.0s)]
*  It's doable. Trump and Doge has removed our blinders. There's no more innocence to fall back on. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1773.0s)]
*  It's like my 15 year old self after discovering his first playboy. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1779.0s)]
*  Who knew there was such great writing? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1785.0s)]
*  The Biden White House diluted people to thinking that this is what life was going to be forever. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1789.0s)]
*  Trans, Soros, racial conflict, open borders, Jimmy Kimmel. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1794.0s)]
*  And you better not fight back or they'll put you in jail. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1799.0s)]
*  And now all of this stuff is being undone faster than Kim Kardashian's bra at an NBA mini camp. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1803.0s)]
*  And with Doge opening the books, you can't close them. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1809.0s)]
*  So that's my tough love message for today's Democrats. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1816.0s)]
*  Stop behaving like you can undo the undoing. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1819.0s)]
*  Sure, the truth hurts. But after what you did to us, we'll call it even. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1824.0s)]
*  Tonight's guest, she's no longer confined to just the sideline host of the Michelle Tavoya podcast, Michelle Tavoya. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1829.0s)]
*  His name is short for not rich comedian. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1839.0s)]
*  Rich. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1843.0s)]
*  Frankly, it would have been quicker to adopt a baby. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1844.0s)]
*  And he took two buses to work today, one under each arm. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1850.0s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1853.0s)]
*  Michelle, this is the first time I think I've seen this, where a party is facing a party that is not a party. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1866.0s)]
*  This is the first time I think I've seen this, where a party is facing an existential question about their actual identity and they haven't come to grips with it yet. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1875.0s)]
*  What say you? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1886.0s)]
*  I say you're right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1887.0s)]
*  Why thank you. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1888.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1889.0s)]
*  Next. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1890.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1891.0s)]
*  And again, it's also the media can't move on. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1893.0s)]
*  They are still so glued to the narrative that they've always been glued to. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1896.0s)]
*  The New York Times. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1901.0s)]
*  Look, I was a sports journalist, but any and all journalism should be curious, objective and honest. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1902.0s)]
*  And it's been years since the New York Times was that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1908.0s)]
*  And that headline that you showed just proves that I did a little research. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1911.0s)]
*  The New York Times digital subscriptions, they claim they're going up. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1915.0s)]
*  But for their news only digital subscription down for nine straight quarters, I think people only use them for word. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1919.0s)]
*  Now, I really do. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1926.0s)]
*  You know who's digital subscriptions going up? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1927.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Tubin. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1929.0s)]
*  Well, his subscription is talking these digits. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1930.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1933.0s)]
*  A masturbation joke. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1935.0s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1937.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1938.0s)]
*  You've taken me completely out of my thinking. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1941.0s)]
*  OK, so as you as Schellenberger pointed out, yeah, we know what the numbers are. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1944.0s)]
*  The government accountability office tells us we're losing billions of federal governments losing billions of dollars every year. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1949.0s)]
*  But if Elon says it, it's got to be sketchy. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1956.0s)]
*  And I would like to point out also how these journalists now are introducing Elon. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1960.0s)]
*  It's no longer Tesla founder Elon Musk. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1965.0s)]
*  It's no longer founder of SpaceX Elon Musk. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1968.0s)]
*  It's no longer owner of Twitter Elon Musk. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1971.0s)]
*  It's unelected billionaire Elon Musk standing with his billionaire bro Trump. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1973.0s)]
*  And they're not to be trusted. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1979.0s)]
*  So they're turning this conveniently into a class warfare thing, of course, as well. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1981.0s)]
*  So I would just say to the New York Times, you know, after 2016 when Trump got elected, you said you were going to reassess and you were going to go find out what's going on in all of America. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1986.0s)]
*  You've whiffed then and you're whiffing now. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1996.0s)]
*  Whiffing all over the place. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=1999.0s)]
*  I feel like it's been about three weeks in the Trump world. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2001.0s)]
*  Are you just having the time of your life? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2007.0s)]
*  You look healthier. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2009.0s)]
*  You look younger. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2010.0s)]
*  I think even bathed. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2011.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, you're not an MRI, but I might look good on the outside, but I'm melting on the inside. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2012.0s)]
*  OK, it's just I'm having a time of my life. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2022.0s)]
*  Like I've never seen one side just let it go. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2029.0s)]
*  It's like a night that had his arms and legs cut off and just sitting there going, just a mere flesh wound. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2033.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2041.0s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2042.0s)]
*  The right is living rent free in the left's head. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2044.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2048.0s)]
*  Move on. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2049.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2050.0s)]
*  I say, you know, my wife said that to me. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2051.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2053.0s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2054.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2055.0s)]
*  So I went back to my bedroom. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2056.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2058.0s)]
*  Don't laugh too hard. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2066.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2067.0s)]
*  We might see something fly across the room. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2068.0s)]
*  I can only hope. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2073.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting there. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2076.0s)]
*  What is this day? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2077.0s)]
*  Five past due date? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2078.0s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2079.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2080.0s)]
*  I'm going to be OK. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2081.0s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2085.0s)]
*  I have my towel. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2087.0s)]
*  I have my towel. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2088.0s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2089.0s)]
*  How do you think I feel? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2090.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2093.0s)]
*  You know, all those years of playing football, I'm the center. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2094.0s)]
*  Making random kids across the country, I'm ready. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2098.0s)]
*  If she has her baby, do I hit bonus? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2101.0s)]
*  Kat, all right. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2104.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2106.0s)]
*  What did you make of the song? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2107.0s)]
*  The song was pretty great. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2109.0s)]
*  We haven't talked about the song yet. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2110.0s)]
*  Oh, it was rough. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2111.0s)]
*  That's from the 1930s. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2112.0s)]
*  They're really progressive. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2113.0s)]
*  It was rough. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2114.0s)]
*  Look, I think it would be one thing to maybe criticize Elon Musk or criticize Doge, but [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2115.0s)]
*  to only do that and criticize the way in which maybe Elon talks about the fraud or uncovers [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2122.0s)]
*  the fraud and the waste and not the waste and fraud itself reminds me of the guy where [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2129.0s)]
*  if you confront him about you're cheating on me, here's the evidence. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2135.0s)]
*  He goes, you went through my phone. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2138.0s)]
*  How am I supposed to be with you if you can't trust me? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2141.0s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2148.0s)]
*  And your reaction to it becomes the conversation. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2152.0s)]
*  It's like, can we not talk about what was found? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2156.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2161.0s)]
*  Apparently not. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2162.0s)]
*  It's the exact same thing because you think if you don't, if you find some issues with [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2163.0s)]
*  the way it was, there's no mention from some of these people about what was found, which [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2168.0s)]
*  should bother you. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2172.0s)]
*  That's a great analogy. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2174.0s)]
*  I'm going to steal that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2175.0s)]
*  That's a good analogy. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2177.0s)]
*  Iris, what say you about these crazy Democrats? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2179.0s)]
*  Well, let's take Democrat out. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2186.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2189.0s)]
*  And to acknowledge what Kat so graciously put forward before. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2190.0s)]
*  I will not say to her point. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2194.0s)]
*  It makes me feel like I'm outnumbered. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2196.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2198.0s)]
*  And I don't want to be on there. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2199.0s)]
*  So it's not cheating. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2202.0s)]
*  It's the murderer who's on death row. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2205.0s)]
*  They have the DNA. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2208.0s)]
*  There was a video of the killing and he's still in front of the camera going, that wasn't me. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2209.0s)]
*  You know, and with Elon next month, it'll be, you know, he's a whore, right? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2218.0s)]
*  See all the children he's had out of wedlock. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2219.0s)]
*  Look at the way he dress. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2221.0s)]
*  You can't, they're doing the old 19th, like shake him down because he has the evidence. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2223.0s)]
*  The reason why everyone's so frustrated on the left, the Anderson Cooper's and all these, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2227.0s)]
*  because they have financially benefited this entire four years. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2232.0s)]
*  They have, they get, oh, you're our guy. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2236.0s)]
*  You get to host new years. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2238.0s)]
*  Here's a company. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2240.0s)]
*  Here's this. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2241.0s)]
*  Your speaking engagements are suddenly worth millions. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2242.0s)]
*  All of that's going to go away. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2245.0s)]
*  So that's why they're fighting. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29WjzvN8t4&t=2247.0s)]
