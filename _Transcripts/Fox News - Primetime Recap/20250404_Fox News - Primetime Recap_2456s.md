# Fox News Highlights - April 3rd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM)
*  And now it's time to choose sides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2.34s)]
*  The plants are starting to construction already. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  We have many plants. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=8.64s)]
*  Indiana, massive auto plant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=11.0s)]
*  Honda. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=14.64s)]
*  We have so many, so many plants [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=16.16s)]
*  and they'll be under construction. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=18.32s)]
*  And as they start to build, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=19.44s)]
*  you can see a lot of construction jobs [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  and you can see a lot of jobs when they open. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=22.92s)]
*  So where was AOC? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=25.88s)]
*  Where was Bernie? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=27.6s)]
*  Where was Chuck? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=28.76s)]
*  Where was Hakeem yesterday in the Rose Garden? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=30.78s)]
*  Well, a lot of hard hats were there, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=34.02s)]
*  The working people, people make stuff with their hands. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=36.18s)]
*  You know, those Democrats like to sell themselves [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=39.54s)]
*  as the champions of those hard hat people, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=41.7s)]
*  the working people, the underdogs, the little guys. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=44.84s)]
*  We need a democratic party that fights harder for us [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=48.78s)]
*  with the courage to brawl for the working class. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=52.94s)]
*  We need great candidates here [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=56.5s)]
*  to stand up for the working class. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=58.72s)]
*  Let's stand together. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=60.24s)]
*  All right, the media echo this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=64.24s)]
*  They serve kind of as co-managers [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=65.84s)]
*  of the Democrat working class brand. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=68.36s)]
*  Although they have billionaires like Soros [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=71.28s)]
*  and Reid Hoffman, David Geffen filling their coffers, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=73.52s)]
*  Democrats claim that Trump's the one [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=76.64s)]
*  who doesn't care about regular Americans. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  Republicans right now are a party [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  that's really just about the wealthiest, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=83.56s)]
*  the oligarch, so to speak, in this country [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=85.88s)]
*  about Elon Musk and Donald Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=87.8s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't care about those people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=89.56s)]
*  he never has, never will. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=91.2s)]
*  Okay, this is just absurd on its face. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=94.2s)]
*  Trump's first term economic record pre-COVID [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=96.96s)]
*  where real median household incomes [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=100.74s)]
*  saw their biggest gains in decades, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=102.88s)]
*  that gave the forgotten men and women [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=105.74s)]
*  not only money in their pockets, it gave them hope again. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=108.4s)]
*  And if Trump's an oligarch, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=113.08s)]
*  but why after four long years of sleepy, creepy Joe [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=114.4s)]
*  did Americans making under $50,000 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=117.84s)]
*  without college degrees go MAGA? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=120.28s)]
*  Why did that happen? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=122.5s)]
*  And fast forward to yesterday, Liberation Day. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Who's happiest today about Trump's reciprocal tariffs? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=127.28s)]
*  Well, obviously not Wall Street, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=130.84s)]
*  not those who raked in big money offshoring jobs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=132.56s)]
*  In fact, they're busy trying to scare you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=135.68s)]
*  into turning on Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=138.26s)]
*  The sky is falling, the sky is definitely falling. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=140.4s)]
*  New fears of an American and maybe global recession. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=142.84s)]
*  This is one of the biggest down days since COVID. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  What makes this one different [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=149.68s)]
*  is that it's not a market event, secondarily it is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  It's really an event that impacts [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  the real economy, Main Street. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=157.12s)]
*  Nothing is safe, there is really nowhere to hide [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=159.08s)]
*  because retail is generally an imported sector. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=161.12s)]
*  Ignore the noise, take a breath. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=165.8s)]
*  Remember what Trump said about the tariff doomsdayers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=169.4s)]
*  on Wednesday? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=172.72s)]
*  Never forget every prediction our opponents made [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=174.16s)]
*  about trade for the last 30 years [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=177.0s)]
*  has been proven totally wrong. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=179.16s)]
*  They were wrong about NAFTA, they were wrong about China, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=181.28s)]
*  they were wrong about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=185.04s)]
*  In my first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=188.64s)]
*  Instead, we built the greatest economy [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=193.28s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=195.16s)]
*  No one has been more consistent over the years, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=198.04s)]
*  over the decades, in calling out the globalist's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=200.48s)]
*  grandiose promises than Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  I'd make our allies pay their fair share. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=206.64s)]
*  We're a debtor nation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=209.0s)]
*  Something's gonna happen over the next number of years [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  with this country, because you can't keep going on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=212.16s)]
*  losing 200 billion, and yet we let Japan come in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  and dump everything right into our markets. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=217.04s)]
*  It's not free trade. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=219.56s)]
*  If you ever go to Japan right now [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=220.72s)]
*  and try to sell something, forget about it, Albert, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=222.2s)]
*  just forget about it, it's almost impossible. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=224.16s)]
*  They don't have laws against it, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=226.2s)]
*  they just make it impossible. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=227.28s)]
*  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=228.8s)]
*  they knock the hell out of our companies. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  and yet they're not paying. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=235.28s)]
*  We make it possible for them to sell their oil. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=236.28s)]
*  Why aren't they paying us 25% of what they're making? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=241.44s)]
*  Consistency. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=244.12s)]
*  Look, we had what, 40 years of the globalist policies, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  and we ended up with an America where, yes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=251.28s)]
*  a middle-class couple can buy a lot of 8.99 t-shirts [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=253.28s)]
*  for their kids at Target, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=257.42s)]
*  but home of their own in a decent neighborhood? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  It's becoming out of reach. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  The globalists and the DC Uniparty were fine [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=264.26s)]
*  with keeping that dynamic in place, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=267.98s)]
*  the middle-class constantly struggling to make ends meet. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=270.18s)]
*  But Trump understood how damaging, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=273.98s)]
*  and ultimately how dangerous that is for the country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=276.22s)]
*  So of course, those happiest about Trump's new trade rules [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=280.86s)]
*  are the men and women who get up every day [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=283.82s)]
*  and build more than portfolios. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=286.54s)]
*  Where we are in Pennsylvania to Wisconsin to Michigan, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=288.98s)]
*  when the auto worker was there and said, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=292.92s)]
*  you know, I have seen over my lifetime, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=294.82s)]
*  every factory, every plant, every mill closed down, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=297.92s)]
*  was complete music to our ears out here, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=303.06s)]
*  because we live in this wasteland. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=306.38s)]
*  At some point, somebody needs to speak up for us, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=308.1s)]
*  and this is why we voted for Donald Trump, full stop. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, it wasn't Trump's goal, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=315.96s)]
*  but he exposed the fake populace yesterday. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=318.24s)]
*  Again, Hakeem Jeffries, Jayapal, Rashida Tlaib, AOC, Bernie, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=321.82s)]
*  if they truly cared about the people who've been left behind, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=326.44s)]
*  they would have stood in solidarity with Donald Trump, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=330.1s)]
*  even if they don't agree with him on a lot of other issues. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=333.0s)]
*  But they would have stood for trade policies [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=336.16s)]
*  that give our workers a fighting chance. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=338.44s)]
*  Instead, they actually chose to stand with China [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=341.2s)]
*  and every other country that steals from us. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=345.24s)]
*  Instead, they chose to stand [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  with that same big Democrat donors [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=349.52s)]
*  who love outsourcing our jobs, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=351.84s)]
*  who love setting up factories abroad. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=353.96s)]
*  And instead, those fake populists chose to ignore [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  the plight of small towns across America [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=359.32s)]

*  Pat Buchanan once said, quote, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=698.38s)]
*  to me, the country comes before the economy [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=700.38s)]
*  and the economy exists for the people. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=704.0200000000001s)]
*  And not just certain people, everyone. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=707.38s)]
*  The way we're talking about globalism [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=710.3800000000001s)]
*  kind of reminds me of COVID. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=711.98s)]
*  Remember how you weren't really allowed [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  to question anything? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=714.74s)]
*  Governors who wanted to end lockdowns, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=716.62s)]
*  they were called dumb and dangerous. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=719.02s)]
*  Everyone had to conform. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, the lockdowns weren't working for most of us. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=723.54s)]
*  And if globalism's not working anymore, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=726.38s)]
*  we're allowed to change it up. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=729.34s)]
*  Trump's got every right to change it up. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  He ran on it and won on it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=733.22s)]
*  We're not just asking everybody to change their religion, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=735.78s)]
*  just change how much access we give the world. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=739.62s)]
*  Because right now we're giving the world full access [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=742.82s)]
*  and getting nothing back. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=745.58s)]
*  This isn't new. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  America used to have no income tax. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=748.94s)]
*  We raised all revenue from tariffs. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=751.7800000000001s)]
*  And that made us an industrial powerhouse [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=754.74s)]
*  that won us two world wars. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=756.74s)]

*  Here's Nancy from 96. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=763.1s)]
*  She sounded like Trump in a pantsuit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=765.22s)]
*  In terms of jobs, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=768.46s)]
*  this is the biggest and cruelest hoax of all. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=769.62s)]
*  Not only do we not have market access, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=773.58s)]
*  not only do they have prohibitive tariffs, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=775.82s)]
*  not only are our exports not let in very specifically, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=778.14s)]
*  but China benefits with at least 10 million jobs [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=782.54s)]
*  from US-China trade. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=788.26s)]
*  Nancy used to be a patriot, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=789.94s)]
*  but then all of her pillow talk with Polly P [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=791.58s)]
*  made her 200 million, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=793.9s)]
*  and now all she cares about is her portfolio, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=795.02s)]
*  not the American people. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=797.46s)]
*  Back in the day, Bernie Sanders was calling Bush [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=800.58s)]
*  and Obama sellouts for what they did to the country. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=803.1s)]
*  What they have said is that we need to not worry [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=806.38s)]
*  about manufacturing in America, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=812.86s)]
*  because what we should establish [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=816.34s)]
*  is a policy of unfettered free trade. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  We don't need tariffs. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=821.7800000000001s)]
*  What we need is to allow corporate America the freedom, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  throw American workers out on the street, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=827.02s)]
*  because somehow, Madam President, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=829.46s)]
*  we are gonna create wealth in America [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=831.62s)]
*  and good-paying jobs in America as we shut down plants, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=833.9s)]
*  we move to China, corporations there pay workers [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=837.66s)]
*  20, 30 cents an hour, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=841.22s)]
*  and we bring the product back into this country. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=842.62s)]
*  History proved both of them right. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=845.62s)]
*  So why aren't Bernie and Nancy celebrating Liberation Day? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=847.86s)]
*  Nancy called Trump's tariffs reckless, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=851.38s)]
*  and Bernie said nothing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=853.46s)]
*  Trump's doing what Democrats demanded for decades, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=856.26s)]
*  protect our industry and commit to fair trade. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=858.58s)]
*  Now, I'm only in my 40s. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  I know I look a lot younger, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=865.1s)]
*  but I've never seen a president stand up to Wall Street. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=866.9s)]
*  Have you? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=869.3000000000001s)]
*  Trump just stared the market right in the face [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=870.74s)]
*  while it sold off 4%. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=873.3000000000001s)]
*  It's like sending your screwed up son to a military academy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=875.98s)]
*  You know it's gonna hurt him at first, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=879.58s)]
*  and he's not gonna like it, and it's gonna be painful, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=881.34s)]
*  but in the long run, it's gonna make him a man. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=883.94s)]
*  The right thing to do isn't always easy. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=887.6600000000001s)]
*  It's easy to do nothing and keep the country crumbling [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=890.94s)]
*  and let the next generation handle it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=894.7800000000001s)]
*  We're already seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=897.62s)]
*  General Motors just announced [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  it's ramping up production of trucks in Indiana [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=901.46s)]
*  and hiring more Americans. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  Big Beef is over the moon about tariffs. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=906.74s)]
*  They say for too long, America's family farmers [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=909.5s)]
*  and ranchers have been mistreated [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=913.02s)]
*  by certain trading partners around the world. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=914.42s)]
*  President Trump is taking action [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=916.54s)]
*  to address numerous trade barriers [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=918.26s)]
*  that prevent consumers overseas [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=920.78s)]

*  We can't sell them our cars, our rice. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=935.54s)]
*  They can tax our products, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=938.78s)]
*  but if we dare tax theirs, it's insanity? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=940.14s)]
*  Silicon Valley's excited about the tariffs [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=943.26s)]
*  because the Europeans have been brutalizing them. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=945.34s)]
*  Some are so excited, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=948.34s)]

*  Energy prices, mortgage rates, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=957.14s)]

*  And if you're worried cars are gonna cost more, buy American. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=965.66s)]

*  For the next couple of months, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=972.86s)]

*  You come into our store, you get employee pricing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  This is kind of to call a little bit of a timeout. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=982.74s)]
*  We've heard some uncertainty from our customers [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=984.78s)]

*  we export the most. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=998.18s)]
*  And so we here at Ford, we're in a good position [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=999.66s)]
*  to address customers' concern [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1002.3399999999999s)]

*  We put ourselves in the driver's seat. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1021.26s)]
*  If we would have asked some of these countries, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1023.74s)]
*  most of these countries to do us a favor, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1026.6599999999999s)]

*  If somebody said that we're gonna give you something [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1036.2199999999998s)]
*  that's so phenomenal, as long as they're giving us [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  something that's good, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1040.06s)]
*  the tariffs give us great power to negotiate. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1041.4599999999998s)]
*  We always have. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1044.4599999999998s)]
*  I've used them very well in the first administration, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1045.3s)]
*  as you saw, but now we're taking it to a whole new level [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1048.2199999999998s)]
*  because it's a worldwide situation. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1051.06s)]
*  France, Thailand, South Korea, already signaling, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1055.5s)]

*  This is the first time in a hundred years [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1061.82s)]
*  America's stood up for itself on trade. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1063.66s)]
*  Countries know 47 means business because he knows business. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1067.26s)]
*  Eric Trump puts it this way, quote, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1071.78s)]

*  all the big developments [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1090.74s)]
*  from President Trump's Liberation Day shakeup. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1091.9s)]
*  We will also help educate, it's a public service, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1094.78s)]
*  Democrats, a legacy media mob [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1098.3s)]
*  about the virtues of fair trade, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1100.18s)]
*  the virtues of a little bit of courage [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1103.06s)]
*  and not living your life in total complete cowardice [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1105.34s)]
*  and fear, and later, Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1107.98s)]
*  He's unveiling a bold new plan to move fast [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1110.86s)]
*  on the president's economic agenda in Congress, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1114.82s)]
*  including permanent tax cuts, no tax on tips, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1117.8999999999999s)]

*  and without any input from the Senate Parliamentarium. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1124.3s)]
*  We'll explain, gets a little complicated, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1126.7s)]
*  not too complicated. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1128.46s)]
*  Also tonight, we're gonna get a progress report [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1130.02s)]
*  from Border Czar, Tom Homan, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1132.74s)]

*  and skeptical of Barack Obama, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1147.02s)]
*  and in our other news of the day segment, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1148.78s)]
*  we have, well, NHL fights, Whoopi's resistance, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1152.06s)]
*  and we'll tell you where to go [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1155.98s)]
*  to survive an alien invasion. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1157.62s)]
*  I'm sure you've all been waiting for that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1159.98s)]
*  But we begin with another predictable cycle [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1161.82s)]
*  of feign moral outrage from the Democratic, radical left, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1164.22s)]
*  the chicken littles of the left, they're at it again, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1168.48s)]
*  for about the 500th time in a decade. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1171.48s)]
*  They tell us the world is coming to an end. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1174.38s)]
*  It's over, Donald Trump spoke, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1176.88s)]
*  this time over President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1179.6s)]
*  Look, it's a choice between protecting American industry, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1183.16s)]
*  it's about saving you money, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1187.44s)]
*  it's about high-paying career jobs [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1189.76s)]
*  for hardworking Americans all across the country, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1191.96s)]
*  versus allowing the rest of the world [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1194.98s)]
*  to rip you off and restrict our products in their markets, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1197.46s)]
*  and walk all over our workers, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1202.26s)]
*  and walk all over our country. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1204.38s)]
*  Democrats, they've chosen the latter. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1206.46s)]
*  This is particularly insane coming from a party [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1208.42s)]
*  that loves to use the phrase working folks. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1210.96s)]
*  Remember, not long ago, Democrats, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1214.16s)]
*  they claimed to care about the Rust Belt, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1216.08s)]
*  American manufacturing, about union workers, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1218.54s)]
*  about living wages, they're the minimum wage party. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1221.24s)]
*  Maybe that's where they want everybody, on minimum wage. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1224.38s)]
*  Even Nancy Pelosi promoted tariffs as a critical tool [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1227.32s)]
*  to protect American industry [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1232.08s)]
*  against unfair practices of foreign countries. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1234.24s)]
*  Sounds like Trump, take a look. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1237.7s)]
*  In terms of tariffs, I think it's interesting to note [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1240.36s)]
*  that the average US MFN tariff on Chinese goods [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1243.32s)]
*  coming into the United States is 2%, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1246.32s)]
*  whereas the average Chinese MFN tariff [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1249.36s)]
*  on US goods going into China is 35%. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1252.72s)]
*  Is that reciprocal? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1256.52s)]
*  You have a serious threat, not only to our relationship, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1258.48s)]
*  but to the industrialized world. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1261.92s)]
*  And if there's one message that I want our colleagues [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1264.12s)]
*  to understand today, and our constituents, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1266.28s)]
*  is that on this day, your member of Congress [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1268.92s)]
*  could have drawn the line to say to the president [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1272.0s)]
*  of the United States, do something about this US-China [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1274.64s)]
*  trade relationship that is a job loser for the United States. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1277.8s)]
*  Wow, sound familiar? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1282.68s)]
*  She even used the word reciprocal. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1283.88s)]
*  As a matter of fact, eight years before Pelosi [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1286.36s)]
*  made those remarks, Donald Trump was on with Oprah Winfrey [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1289.02s)]
*  with a similar message. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1293.3s)]
*  The only difference is, Pelosi changed, Trump did not. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1294.8999999999999s)]
*  We're a debtor nation. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1299.86s)]
*  Something's gonna happen over the next number of years [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1300.9399999999998s)]
*  with this country, because you can't keep going on [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1303.02s)]
*  losing 200 billion, and yet we let Japan come in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1304.74s)]
*  and dump everything right into our markets. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1307.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not free trade. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1310.3799999999999s)]
*  If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1311.58s)]
*  forget about it, Oprah, just forget about it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1314.02s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  They don't have laws against it, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1317.08s)]
*  they just make it impossible. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1319.6799999999998s)]
*  they knock the hell out of our companies, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1322.1999999999998s)]
*  and hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1324.0s)]
*  I mean, you can respect somebody that's beaten [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1326.84s)]
*  the hell out of you, but they are beating the hell [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1328.56s)]
*  out of this country. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1330.24s)]
*  Kuwait, they live like kings. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1331.3999999999999s)]
*  The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1332.8s)]
*  and yet they're not paying. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1335.36s)]
*  We make it possible for them to sell their oil. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1336.36s)]
*  Why aren't they paying us 25% of what they're making? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1338.86s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1341.52s)]
*  Why doesn't Oprah, why didn't she support him? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1343.34s)]
*  Anyway, unlike Pelosi, President Trump still cares [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1346.26s)]
*  about American workers, the American industry, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1348.58s)]
*  and a lot of industries are impacted by this. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1352.3s)]
*  He meant what he said. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1354.6999999999998s)]
*  He campaigned on restoring free and fair trade, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1356.06s)]
*  and now he's fulfilling his commitment that he made [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1358.9399999999998s)]
*  to all of you, the American people, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1361.8999999999999s)]
*  and on the other side of the aisle, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1363.86s)]
*  Democrats are perfectly content to overlook unbalanced tariffs [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1365.4199999999998s)]
*  that effectively block American products abroad. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1369.6799999999998s)]
*  The Party of Compassion also seems to have no problem [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1372.9599999999998s)]
*  with Chinese sweatshops, other foreign businesses [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1376.76s)]
*  flooding our market with cheap goods, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1379.9599999999998s)]
*  intellectual property theft, and they do it year after year. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1382.12s)]
*  Killing off high-paying American jobs in the process. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1385.56s)]
*  It really does make you wonder, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1389.3s)]
*  do the Democrats stand for anything [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1391.4399999999998s)]
*  other than biological men playing women's sports, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1393.6s)]
*  open borders, and unlimited government waste fraud, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1396.12s)]
*  abuse and corruption, oh, and bingo cards [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1400.02s)]
*  when a president is speaking? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1402.34s)]
*  Just so we are clear, the world is not ending. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1404.34s)]
*  Instead, as we speak, dozens and dozens of countries [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1407.86s)]
*  are desperately trying to negotiate with the White House. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1412.1799999999998s)]
*  They don't want Donald Trump's tariffs, and guess what? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1416.06s)]
*  Most of them will give in and capitulate, and he will win. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1420.02s)]
*  The playing field is now getting leveled. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1423.08s)]
*  Little messy in the beginning. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1425.3s)]
*  As Treasury Secretary Scott Bissen pointed out, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1426.86s)]
*  Trump's reciprocal tariffs plan is a winning strategy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1429.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1433.08s)]
*  Everybody sit back, take a deep breath. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1434.9199999999998s)]
*  Don't immediately retaliate. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1437.1999999999998s)]
*  Let's see where this goes, because if you retaliate, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1439.32s)]
*  that's how we get escalation. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1442.4599999999998s)]
*  Remember that the history of trade [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1444.12s)]
*  is we are the deficit country. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1449.12s)]
*  The deficit country has an advantage. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  They are the surplus countries. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1455.36s)]
*  The surplus countries traditionally always lose [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1457.12s)]
*  any kind of a trade escalation. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1460.04s)]
*  So as a student of economic history [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1461.7s)]
*  or a professor of economic history, I devise against it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1464.6799999999998s)]
*  So amid all the hysteria on the left [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1468.72s)]
*  and in the media mob and the Democrats, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1471.3799999999999s)]
*  there are two important points to remember. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  One, as Bissen described, this plan is based on logic [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1475.1599999999999s)]
*  and leverage led by a president [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1479.6599999999999s)]
*  who is a natural born deal maker. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1482.1s)]
*  Two, this is the land of the free, the home of the brave, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1484.32s)]
*  where manifest destiny becomes reality for people. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1488.08s)]
*  This is the last place on earth where free thought, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1491.54s)]
*  new innovative ideas are welcomed, rewarded [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1495.24s)]
*  where almost anything is possible with hard work, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1499.04s)]
*  sound principles, a positive attitude. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, this perfectly describes President Trump. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1504.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1507.8s)]
*  I think it's going very well. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1509.36s)]
*  It was an operation. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1510.68s)]
*  Like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1512.46s)]
*  I said this would exactly be the way it is. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1516.8600000000001s)]
*  We have six or $7 trillion coming into our country [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1520.26s)]
*  and we've never seen anything like it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  The markets are gonna boom, the stock is gonna boom, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1528.06s)]
*  the country is gonna boom. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1530.5s)]
*  And the rest of the world wants to see [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1532.2s)]
*  is there any way they can make a deal. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1533.9s)]
*  By the way, since the trade tariff talk began [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1536.9s)]
*  and the threat began, we have almost $5 trillion [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1540.52s)]
*  in committed money to be spent in the United States. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1543.58s)]
*  Not an accident. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1546.34s)]
*  We have been scrolling that list for you night after night. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1547.5s)]
*  I have no doubt that American innovators, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1550.18s)]
*  American workers, they will reach new heights [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1552.46s)]
*  with fair trade practices. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1554.68s)]
*  One of those innovators, of course, Elon Musk. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1556.46s)]
*  He's been busy helping root out waste, fraud, abuse, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1559.1s)]
*  corruption inside our government. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1561.94s)]
*  And moments ago, President Trump previewed [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1563.58s)]
*  a massive new development from the dedicated team at Doge [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1566.18s)]
*  that is saving you a lot of money. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1570.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1571.76s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how long Elon Musk's mission [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1573.56s)]
*  will last and when he will depart? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1577.88s)]
*  Well, Elon is fantastic. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1580.52s)]
*  And I think it's, he's a patriot [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1582.56s)]
*  and I think it's a shame what they're doing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1584.56s)]
*  with his car company. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1587.0s)]
*  And a great car, it's a great car, a great product. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1588.96s)]
*  I would say Elon will stay for a certain period of time [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1591.82s)]
*  and that he's gonna wanna get back to his businesses [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1594.84s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1597.06s)]
*  But he's done a fantastic job. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1598.34s)]
*  We found hundreds of, think of it, just hundreds of, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1599.78s)]
*  we found millions of dollars of fraud and abuse and waste [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1603.78s)]
*  and they're still going, I mean, they're going strong. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1609.9s)]
*  They found something today that's horrible. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1614.06s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1616.98s)]
*  So what they found, well, you'll find out very soon. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1617.82s)]
*  Will Doge stick around in some kind of capacity? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1620.5s)]
*  Yeah, it'll still doge, doge itself, yeah. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1623.5s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1627.96s)]
*  Trump proclaimed April 2nd Liberation Day [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1628.8s)]
*  when global tariffs went into effect. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1631.16s)]
*  Which makes me wonder, has our country and its taxpayers [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1633.44s)]
*  gotten ripped off more than, for more than 50 years? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1636.26s)]
*  Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1640.56s)]
*  for more than 50 years, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1643.12s)]
*  but it is not going to happen anymore. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1645.32s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1648.56s)]
*  Trump calls them reciprocal tariffs. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1650.4s)]
*  But Mr. President, what does that mean? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1652.98s)]
*  Reciprocal, that means they do it to us [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1656.06s)]
*  and we do it to them. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1659.22s)]
*  Very simple, can't get any simpler than that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1660.8600000000001s)]
*  Again, reciprocal, back and forth, back and forth. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  Back and forth, back and forth. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1670.74s)]
*  Kind of like how you return a beached whale to the ocean. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1674.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1676.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1677.7s)]
*  And what about that old fashioned term, groceries? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1679.96s)]
*  An old fashioned term that we use groceries. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1684.2s)]
*  I used it on the campaign. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1686.28s)]
*  It's such an old fashioned term, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1688.32s)]
*  but a beautiful term, groceries. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1689.6000000000001s)]
*  It sort of says a bag with different things in it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1691.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bag with different things in it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1695.92s)]
*  That's how they describe Joy Behar's cat scan. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1700.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1708.68s)]
*  But look, Trump knows what he's doing [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1711.3600000000001s)]
*  because he runs successful businesses before, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1712.8s)]
*  unlike the current Dems who want to tell you [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1715.0s)]
*  how to run your life, but show no evidence [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1716.88s)]
*  of how well they've run theirs. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1718.76s)]
*  Have any of them ever accomplished anything [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1721.0800000000002s)]
*  before politics? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1723.04s)]
*  No, it's degree, degree, law school activists [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1724.28s)]
*  ran over a teenager drunk. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1727.52s)]
*  It's the Democrat career path. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1731.24s)]
*  The power comes first, then the money. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1733.24s)]
*  That's how you get a first lady who insists [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1735.74s)]
*  you call her doctor, but her one patient's [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1737.56s)]
*  been on life support for a decade. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1740.34s)]
*  Yeah, remember our last president [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1744.54s)]
*  who spent his entire professional life in government? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1749.5s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1753.78s)]
*  And the Dem president before that was a community organizer, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1756.74s)]
*  what normal people call unemployable. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1760.5s)]
*  Yet now he's got homes in DC, Hawaii, Martha's Vineyard [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1763.26s)]
*  with a basketball court for Barack [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1766.72s)]
*  and a weight room for Michelle. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1768.8s)]
*  Go back further, what did Bill Clinton actually do [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1772.44s)]
*  before government? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1774.8s)]
*  You know, besides a few dozen hookers [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1775.8s)]
*  and countless lines of Coke. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1777.8400000000001s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, the only thing Chuck did [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1780.24s)]
*  besides government is create new ways to kill Batman. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1782.56s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, the guy lived in a commune [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  before being booted for hoarding soup. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1791.96s)]
*  There's Cory Booker, whose greatest achievement [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1795.1799999999998s)]
*  is going a day straight without peeing. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1797.82s)]
*  Well, at least he did something straight. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1800.7s)]
*  But I don't get it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1804.62s)]
*  AOC tended bar before politics where the most popular order [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1807.4199999999998s)]
*  was turn up the TV and stop talking. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1811.62s)]
*  Before becoming Cardi B with a head injury, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1816.52s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett was an ambulance chaser. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  She was an ambulance chaser doing pro bono work for BLM. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1824.32s)]
*  And trust me, BLM overpaid. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1832.74s)]
*  Now look at the Trump machine, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1836.46s)]
*  filled with people who did great things first, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1837.58s)]
*  then public service. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1839.58s)]
*  Our current press built half the Manhattan skyline. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1840.86s)]
*  And without those buildings, where could the left protest? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1843.74s)]
*  Then we got the world's richest guy [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1847.1799999999998s)]
*  who also rescues astronauts and help the paralyzed walk [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1848.78s)]
*  and other stuff that I do on the weekends. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1851.84s)]
*  He's even tackling the decline in the world's population, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1855.1599999999999s)]
*  one hot chick at a time. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1858.28s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, career military, multiple deployments, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1862.72s)]
*  Fox and Friends host, which some say is worse [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1865.8s)]
*  than two tours in Iraq. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1868.56s)]
*  There's Howard Lutnick, Scott Bessent, Vivek. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1872.1799999999998s)]
*  They were all about accomplishments first [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1875.96s)]
*  and service later. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1877.86s)]
*  See, successful people realize that life is a ladder [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1879.46s)]
*  with two steps. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1882.46s)]
*  Level one, you figure out your life first. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1883.7s)]
*  Level two, then you help others. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1886.06s)]
*  The Dems reversed that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1888.14s)]
*  Level one, solve the world's problems [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1889.5s)]
*  from a position of inexperience. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1892.1000000000001s)]
*  Level two, get rich off your phony status. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1894.8600000000001s)]
*  Meaning their first level of sacrifice [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1898.66s)]
*  is really just self-serving. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1901.46s)]
*  You can exploit being a community organizer, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1903.42s)]
*  but not developing real estate. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1906.3s)]
*  It's why this idiot became mayor of LA, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1908.3s)]
*  but not this guy. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1911.8799999999999s)]
*  Under bass, LA burned to the ground [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1913.8799999999999s)]
*  and since then has issued only four permits [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1916.24s)]
*  to rebuild homes. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1918.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Rick Caruso, a real estate tycoon, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1920.44s)]
*  has already launched a new group aimed at expediting [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1923.2s)]
*  the city's rebuild. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1926.32s)]
*  You can't get a better contrast. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1927.96s)]
*  It's like a swimsuit contest between Rosie O'Connell, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1929.74s)]
*  not Donald, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1932.52s)]
*  and a chick. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1935.76s)]
*  This is why you have to fix your world [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1938.3s)]
*  before you fix the outside world. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1941.3s)]
*  It's no surprise that leftist activists [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1943.78s)]
*  have awful personal lives. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1946.1s)]
*  They perform globally, but ignore locally. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1947.94s)]
*  Oh, let's clean the planet, everyone. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1951.3799999999999s)]
*  I'll shower next week. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1953.58s)]
*  It would be funny if we weren't at their mercy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1955.54s)]
*  The more they try to fix the world, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1959.02s)]
*  the worse our world gets. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1961.06s)]
*  That's their only path to equality. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1963.34s)]
*  That's their only path to equality, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1966.02s)]
*  making everybody as miserable as they are. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1968.34s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1973.92s)]
*  Welcome to tonight's guest. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1974.76s)]
*  He once spent an entire month strung out on hair conditioner. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1978.62s)]
*  Co-host of Fox & Friends weekend, Charlie Hurd. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1982.3799999999999s)]
*  He's the argument against warning labels on poison. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1987.82s)]
*  Comedian Joe Mackey. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1991.18s)]
*  He's the reason for background checks. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1992.7s)]
*  Former GOP congressman George Santos. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=1995.7s)]
*  And finally, she only has one name, just like polio. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2000.46s)]
*  Host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2004.18s)]
*  Charlie, I'm not gonna name names, but if you go on X, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2011.98s)]
*  you see a lot of conservatives melting down [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2014.46s)]
*  in kind of an exercise of like, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2016.78s)]
*  see, see how bad this is, see how bad this is. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2018.42s)]
*  I'm right, tariffs are bad, tariffs are bad. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2021.34s)]
*  Trump is ruining the world. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2023.54s)]
*  And it's like, nothing's happened, you idiot. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2026.22s)]
*  Yeah, surprise, Wall Street does not like the tariffs. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2029.02s)]
*  Yeah, why don't they like it? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2031.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, they claim to be free market, but you know what? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2033.42s)]
*  They have a really hard time explaining it [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2038.42s)]
*  to us dumb people. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2040.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2041.8600000000001s)]
*  So that we can, Trump is able to explain it perfectly. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2042.7s)]
*  And by the way, if you're gonna be free market, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2045.5s)]
*  then why are guns so expensive? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2047.94s)]
*  Then why are governments negotiating [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2050.5s)]
*  all these free market deals? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2052.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2054.02s)]
*  A free market deal would be a deal [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2054.86s)]
*  that we just make among ourselves. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2056.3s)]
*  I love everything about your monologue, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2058.1000000000004s)]
*  especially the part about, and it's so simple, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2059.78s)]
*  these people become millionaires. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2062.1000000000004s)]
*  They come to Washington with nothing [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2064.6600000000003s)]
*  and they leave millionaires. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2066.1000000000004s)]
*  And when Donald Trump first ran in 2015, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2068.78s)]
*  he would sit down, he hired some people, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2072.3s)]
*  some political people in town, and he would begin, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2074.3s)]
*  the campaign would begin every single conference call [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2077.1400000000003s)]
*  with their surrogates saying, Donald Trump is a builder. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2080.54s)]
*  He builds buildings. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2083.86s)]
*  And everyone on the call would start laughing. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2085.82s)]
*  Like, what does this mean? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2088.3s)]
*  This doesn't mean anything, it means everything. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2089.98s)]
*  And the American people saw through all of it, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2092.94s)]
*  he is not a political ideologue, he is a practical guy. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2094.7400000000002s)]
*  And so, and that's why I think that a lot of people [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2098.86s)]
*  have faith in him. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2101.14s)]
*  You know, obviously the tariffs thing, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2101.98s)]
*  who knows how all this plays out, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2103.26s)]
*  but because he's not an ideologue, if it turns out [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2105.14s)]
*  that there are bad things that happen, he will change. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2108.26s)]
*  Yeah, and also, I mean, he's been ahead of the curve [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2112.5s)]
*  on everything. Everything. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2114.42s)]
*  So you kind of got to, you have good faith in him. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2115.46s)]
*  Joe, a lot of people don't know this about you, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2117.5800000000004s)]
*  but you're a comedian. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2119.78s)]
*  Oh. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2120.82s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2121.6400000000003s)]
*  You're pretty knowledgeable on trade, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2125.1000000000004s)]
*  and I want to ask you a softball question [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2127.3s)]
*  that I asked Harold Ford and that he didn't answer today. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2130.1000000000004s)]
*  Is there any proof that free trade actually pays off [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2132.34s)]
*  for American workers? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2135.46s)]
*  No, there isn't. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2137.46s)]
*  That's the reason that the stock market's going down today [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2139.2200000000003s)]
*  because all the executives and stockholders [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2141.78s)]
*  in these companies that really profited [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2144.58s)]
*  by shipping jobs overseas, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2146.54s)]
*  where they don't have to face environmental status, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2148.7400000000002s)]
*  where they don't have to have high wages, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2150.42s)]
*  have been getting a lot richer than they would be otherwise, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2152.4s)]
*  where if we had a level playing field, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2155.1400000000003s)]
*  that's what you're, it kind of plays into your point [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2157.82s)]
*  about how a lot of the politicians [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2159.54s)]
*  don't have any real world experience, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2161.58s)]
*  where there are consequences, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2163.42s)]
*  where the incentives matter, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2165.1s)]
*  and when you have two options, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2167.06s)]
*  one is that you can have your factory in a country [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2169.54s)]
*  with high wages and high labor standards [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2172.64s)]
*  or face no penalty for having your factory overseas [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2174.64s)]
*  with none of those things, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2177.88s)]
*  you're not gonna pick the high labor standard thing, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2179.14s)]
*  and I understand that free trade is a good thing in theory, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2181.92s)]
*  but so is having a rock band [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2185.04s)]
*  that plays funk music and party music, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2187.42s)]
*  but then when you hear it, it's the Red Hot Chili Peppers, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2190.16s)]
*  and it's terrible. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2192.54s)]
*  And all these people saying that, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2193.58s)]
*  we're gonna lose this trade war, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2199.06s)]
*  well the joke's on them, we don't make anything, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2200.42s)]
*  and it's a national security issue as well, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2203.46s)]
*  people are saying we're gonna go to war with China, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2206.2799999999997s)]
*  how are we gonna go to war with the country [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2208.86s)]
*  that makes everything that we need, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2211.06s)]
*  it's like one of my many lovers attacking me [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2213.34s)]
*  and then asking for access to my body. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2216.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2219.14s)]
*  So true, so true. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2223.3799999999997s)]
*  George, I have to ask you, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2226.14s)]
*  because I don't have the answer, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2227.18s)]
*  what did you do before politics? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2228.48s)]
*  You just kinda showed up. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2230.74s)]
*  So I was actually in capital markets, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2233.66s)]
*  I worked a couple of blocks away from here, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2236.74s)]
*  so in professional fundraising, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  so I understand Wall Street well. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2241.3399999999997s)]
*  So what do you think's going on with the stock market? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2244.66s)]
*  The stock market has become the, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2248.12s)]
*  it's hysteria because it's run by a bunch [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2250.36s)]
*  of hysterical little bitches. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2253.36s)]
*  That's literally what we have today. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2255.0s)]
*  If you look at the CEOs of all the big financial institutions [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2256.88s)]
*  they're acting like little girls in seventh grade. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2261.0s)]
*  They're just scared Trump is a prettier girl in the room [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2263.88s)]
*  if we're to equate it that way. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2266.36s)]
*  But I think this is all reactionary, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2268.38s)]
*  and look, I'm not a tariff guy, I'm skeptical obviously, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2270.64s)]
*  but I trust this guy, I trust this president, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2274.44s)]
*  I trusted him the first time, I mean hell, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2277.2s)]
*  I voted for the guy three times, right? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2278.7599999999998s)]
*  So, and I get to have him two terms. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2280.48s)]
*  And that was just in November. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2282.72s)]
*  So I look at it that we're going to have a good time [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2284.08s)]
*  with this and I'm excited, but look Greg, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2294.62s)]
*  to your monologue as far as not being able to sleep [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2297.2s)]
*  with Chinese nationals, I'm worried, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2299.9399999999996s)]
*  I need to interrupt the show to go call Eric Swalwell [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2302.48s)]
*  to see what he's doing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2305.52s)]
*  Like this is going to be a big hit for him. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2307.08s)]
*  I know, I know, you know, Kennedy, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2309.0s)]
*  you know, the whole, I think the word for the tariffs [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2312.4s)]
*  is negotiation and like the media seems to be [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2314.68s)]
*  avoiding that word that's all about, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2317.56s)]
*  oh my God, the stock market went down [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2319.72s)]
*  and it's never coming back up. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2321.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes. They're insane. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2323.92s)]
*  They think we're all idiots. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2324.96s)]
*  No, and I know there are people who have a lot of money [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2327.12s)]
*  invested in the stock market, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2330.1s)]
*  particularly people who don't have any other assets [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2331.56s)]
*  and they've got a 401k and for people who are close [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  to retirement, it gives them a lot of anxiety [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2336.36s)]
*  because they fear that, you know, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2339.0s)]
*  if it goes down precipitously, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2340.6600000000003s)]
*  they don't have time for it to go back up [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2342.36s)]
*  in order to achieve the number that they want [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2344.36s)]
*  in order to retire and I totally understand that [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2347.0s)]
*  and it's not just rich jerks who are invested [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2350.04s)]
*  in Wall Street, you know, the average investor [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2354.32s)]
*  certainly doesn't run Wall Street, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2356.48s)]
*  but they're hoping to God that this works out [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2358.36s)]
*  and I guess that's where I am because there's a part of it [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2361.56s)]
*  that I philosophically disagree with [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2365.08s)]
*  and I am of the school that tariffs our taxes [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2367.52s)]
*  if they do in fact raise prices on a lot of things [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2370.08s)]
*  that people formerly could afford, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2372.7599999999998s)]
*  but if for some reason, like I'm completely wrong [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2375.3199999999997s)]
*  and this works, I am on America's side here. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2378.52s)]
*  Like I want it to work, even if Trump's not president, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2381.36s)]
*  even if it's some friggin' pinko, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2384.4s)]
*  if they can figure out a system that works for America [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2387.1s)]
*  and makes people here more prosperous, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2389.34s)]
*  then I take that as a win. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2391.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I understand, when you said that tariffs [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2394.52s)]
*  are a tax, couldn't you say that anything [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2397.88s)]
*  that contributes to the price of something then [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2400.64s)]
*  would be a tax? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2402.72s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2404.0s)]
*  I mean the fluctuations in the market, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2404.84s)]
*  like something is simply applying to man. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2406.06s)]
*  But I mean like if you decide to use a different kind of [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2407.9s)]
*  paint on your marital aid, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2410.1s)]
*  that would raise the price, that would be a tax. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2414.52s)]
*  I tend to not paint mine because I don't wanna get a [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2416.36s)]
*  whistling action. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2418.0s)]
*  Oh, what Joe? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2418.84s)]
*  Well, if it was a tax, it's a tax you can avoid [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2420.76s)]
*  by bringing your jobs, your factories, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2423.64s)]
*  back to the United States. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2425.52s)]
*  There aren't many taxes you can avoid by hiring Americans. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2427.64s)]
*  I guess like maybe Hunter Biden will get American [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2431.04s)]
*  prostitutes in the future. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2433.92s)]
*  Yes, and good for him. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2435.4s)]
*  All right, we gotta move on. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2437.68s)]
*  Up next, Obama backstabbed Kamala. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWpbciUNUM&t=2438.6s)]
