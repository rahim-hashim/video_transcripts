# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 6, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4)
*  The real efficiency test. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=0.0s)]
*  Now making government more responsive to the taxpayers is a noble and necessary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=7.0s)]
*  pursuit. And if anyone can make headway, it's billionaire innovator Elon Musk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I mean the guys like Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and Henry Ford all rolled into [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=16.98s)]
*  one person. If he can get a massive rocket off the launch pad, certainly he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=21.72s)]
*  can make real progress on Capitol Hill working with the Doge caucus. But to all [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=27.3s)]
*  the naysayers out there, well, we know what Kamala Harris's approach would have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=31.78s)]
*  been. She would have borrowed imprinted money until the world decided to stop [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=37.34s)]
*  lending to the United States altogether. But as Doge peels back the bureaucratic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=43.38s)]
*  onion, Americans are going to learn a lot about what a joke Washington has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=48.06s)]
*  become. Do you know that most federal workers have never returned to the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=52.74s)]
*  office post COVID? Now back at the start of COVID, the angle predicted that the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=57.7s)]
*  same spoiled stay at home bureaucrats that we had been chronicling and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=63.34s)]
*  discussing at the time for months and months that they would not return [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  voluntarily to the office because sending them home in the first place was [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  a bad precedent. Many federal employees haven't returned to work full time since [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=76.46s)]
*  the pandemic began. In-person work is expected for people like store clerks, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=83.86s)]
*  janitors, airport personnel, but the average federal worker apparently [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  believes staying home is their right. If they haven't been into the office for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=94.72s)]
*  two years, how essential can they really be? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, not essential at all. Now that was three years ago. And where do things stand now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=102.78s)]
*  How many federal employees are actually working in the office? By one estimate, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=109.78s)]
*  it may be about 1% if you don't count the security personnel that are covering [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=114.3s)]
*  these buildings. That is absurd. One of the first things that I think you'll see [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  is a demand from the new administration and from all of us in Congress that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=122.62s)]
*  federal workers were turned to their desks and get back to the work that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=126.5s)]
*  they're supposed to be doing. I think that is common sense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. It is a complete farce. None of you would get away with this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=133.76s)]
*  Why should the federal workers? They've got to come back to the office or they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  just need to be fired. And every Republican on Capitol Hill, they should [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  have been making a huge issue of this all along. How insulting this has been to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  the taxpayers. Now, many of these workers, of course, are not even at home. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  They're off to parts unknown, living their dream lives. Or as this viral photo [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  suggests, just chilling in a bubble bath. All right, every Republican on the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  Hill should be speaking out, demanding that this type of madness end. Now, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=169.88s)]
*  if we can't agree on something like this, then how the heck are we going to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  agree on more complicated spending cuts, the type that Doge wants to carry out? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=180.24s)]
*  Now, even non-MAGA Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, who's certainly no staunch, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=186.08s)]
*  you know, right wing bomb thrower, says the people still at home, the federal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=191.24s)]
*  workforce, they got to get back. Legislation is going to be needed. It [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=195.88s)]
*  should already be written. 53 GOP senators will surely support this. Thus, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=200.24s)]
*  it will pass unless it's filibustered by Democrats. Good. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=207.08s)]
*  I dare Democrats to filibuster this type of legislation. And over the House, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=211.84s)]
*  well, we know there's growing opposition to Musk's work on Doge. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=216.4s)]
*  Well, it's illegal. You know, they haven't asked to meet with me. But the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=221.72s)]
*  impoundment of funds that have been appropriated by the Congress is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=228.4s)]
*  unconstitutional and illegal. There is no such department of government [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=232.32s)]
*  efficiency. It's made up. So good luck to them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=237.96s)]
*  So much for the hope that there would be this bipartisan outpouring of support [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=242.96s)]
*  for Doge. You know, there are a few people here and there, but Hakeem [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=247.44s)]
*  Jeffries, the House minority leader, responded to this whole Doge excitement, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=250.52s)]
*  essentially feigning ignorance, then trying to claim that this idea was his [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=256.0s)]
*  all along. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=261.2s)]
*  It's unclear to me what exactly the objective is related to this so-called [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=261.84s)]
*  Doge initiative. From our perspective, we want a federal government that is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=269.4s)]
*  effective [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=276.44s)]
*  and efficient and equitable. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=278.44s)]
*  And to the extent the other side of the aisle shares that objective, which is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  what is right for the American people, then we'll see if there's common ground [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=287.12s)]
*  as possible. Oh, OK. OK. OK. First of all, you heard the word equitable. Look [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=291.2s)]
*  out for that. And yeah, when all of us think of the word efficiency, we think [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  about the House Democrats. Not. All right. The fact is, members of both [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=301.32s)]
*  parties, though, we got to be fair here on the angle. They're culpable here [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=306.08s)]
*  with majorities voting for budgets that over the years have funded things like [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=310.8s)]
*  this list could go on and on efforts to boost Egyptian tourism, because that's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=315.68s)]
*  your priority. Training for DHS employees to be their authentic and best [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=319.92s)]
*  selves. And I love this. Just found this today. Four million dollars for an [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=325.44s)]
*  Alaska king crab enhancement project. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=331.04s)]
*  Five million for the Louisiana sugar cane research. That's courtesy of Bill [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  Cassidy. Thank you. You know, we could be here again all day long doing this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=341.44s)]
*  list after list after list. And by the way, speaking of lists, the same waste [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  and efficiency analysis must be applied to the Pentagon as well. It's almost, I [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  think, nine hundred billion dollar budget. It also needs major trimming. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=357.56s)]
*  After all, it can't pass an audit for a reason because there is a huge amount of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=362.0s)]
*  fat to be cut there. And the Defense Department is where Vivek and Elon are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=367.04s)]
*  going to find the most resistance, I believe, among the president's own party. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=372.44s)]
*  Let's face it, they've never met a Pentagon budget they didn't like. This [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=376.88s)]
*  must change. It is in 1984. It's not 2004. This is 2024. And we're thirty five [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=380.52s)]
*  trillion dollars in debt. Our interest on that debt is now over one trillion [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=389.4s)]
*  dollars annually, and that will eventually kill us financially. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=395.4s)]
*  But in the end, when you look at the full scope of what needs to be dealt with, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  there is not a lot of point in talking about reform to the big entitlement [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  programs, which is a big share of the budget, Medicare, Medicaid, Social [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=412.56s)]
*  Security, which is a flashpoint in American politics, the toughest thing of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=416.0s)]
*  all, until we can get substantial agreement on the basics. And on those [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  basic issues, some of them we've just discussed, we got to smoke [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=424.84s)]
*  people out here. We have to get them all on the record. If you're not with the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=428.6s)]
*  president's agenda here, you're going to be primaried as a Republican. Just [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=431.96s)]
*  understand that now. Then we can make real progress among both the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=435.6s)]
*  Republicans and the Democrats. And that's the angle. Forty sevens adding a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=441.0s)]
*  YMCA wiggle and a Johnny Carson golf swing to his little boogie. There he is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=445.8s)]
*  celebrating at the Fox Nation Patriot Awards last night on Long Island after [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=450.52s)]
*  winning Patriot of the Year. But how does Melania feel about the dance? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=454.52s)]
*  This is very special and unique dance. It is right. And I think a lot of people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  are copying it and everybody has have fun with it. Yeah. Which part is this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=465.44s)]
*  how you dance? No. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=469.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden left all his dance moves in Africa. He was back in D.C. to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  light the Christmas tree after his little safari. And let's just say he [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=477.56s)]
*  wasn't having a great hair day. Someone left his mousse on Air Force One. And [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=481.44s)]
*  while Trump was getting awards, Biden got named the worst president in modern [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=486.52s)]
*  history. This is a poll from the Daily Mail. Biden went from being on Mount [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=490.64s)]
*  Rushmore to being worse than Jimmy Carter. There's a lot that ails the big [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=495.16s)]
*  guy. But right now he's come down with a wicked case of senioritis. Trump's going [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=499.64s)]
*  to Notre Dame tomorrow. He's going to do the coin toss at the Army Navy game [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=504.76s)]
*  next week, and he's meeting with prime ministers. If Biden is unhappy about [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=509.36s)]
*  being upstaged, he hasn't offered any hints, is what people close to Biden are [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=513.88s)]
*  saying. The consensus in D.C. is that Trump is already basically running [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=518.24s)]
*  things. Trump even called Biden last week to wish him a happy Thanksgiving. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=522.88s)]
*  And the Democrats can't even get it together for a class photo. Watch. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=528.44s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=533.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=534.64s)]
*  Thumbs up is only for winners, Chuck. Plus, the party's still a little cranky [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=537.64s)]
*  over the pardon. Binder had a harder time than usual today. He wrestled with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=541.6s)]
*  this. He wrestled with this. He wrestled with these circumstances. He laid out [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  how he wrestled with this decision. He said this weekend he wrestled with this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=552.12s)]
*  this weekend. Why the president wrestled with this over the weekend. He wrestled [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=556.5s)]
*  with it. He wrestled with it. He wrestled with it and made this decision. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=560.52s)]
*  Hunter was getting a pardon the whole time. The only thing Biden wrestled [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=566.84s)]
*  with was how he was going to get it done once Kamala lost. They had a little [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=570.28s)]
*  deal that if Kamala won, she'd pardon Hunter so that Joe didn't have to. That [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=574.56s)]
*  would look more graceful and compassionate coming from her, and Biden [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=578.84s)]
*  wouldn't have had to go back on his word. But Trump won and made Biden pardon [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=582.4s)]
*  his son. And the raging Cajun still not over this election. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=586.4s)]
*  The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=591.12s)]
*  Biden. If he would have in September of 2023, August said that he wasn't going [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=596.84s)]
*  to run. God, we would have won this election and it wouldn't have been that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=603.88s)]
*  close because we'd have had so many frickin talented people that were running. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=609.8s)]
*  And he would be sitting here right now, getting ready to leave on a high note. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=615.76s)]
*  There would be naming commissions to figure out what we're gonna name after [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=621.86s)]
*  him. I actually feel for Biden and he knows that he f***ed up. Democrats are [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=626.08s)]
*  moaning all over Washington that Biden set us back tremendously. Mark Alpert [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=631.72s)]
*  told us last night. At this point, Biden will probably get a book mobile instead [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=637.12s)]
*  of an actual library. Donors have had it with Joe and they're still calling [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=642.16s)]
*  Kamala and asking her, where'd the money go? Remember how Harris built a backdrop [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=646.36s)]
*  for the Call Her Daddy podcast that cost $100,000? Well, the Call Her Daddy [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=651.24s)]
*  girl says it was a ripoff and Harris paid six figures for cardboard. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=655.8s)]
*  Apparently, you could tell me they spent the Harris campaign spent like [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  $100,000. I did. You know about this? It's hilarious. To build the studio. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=666.12s)]
*  Not true. To make it look like it was the studio that you used in L.A. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  My studio that is gorgeous in Los Angeles doesn't even cost six figures. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=676.48s)]
*  So I don't know how cardboard walls could cost six figures. But [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=682.0s)]
*  But do you think they did that? I mean, you saw it. Absolutely not. With love [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=687.56s)]
*  to them. Oh my God, it was gorgeous. But like, it wasn't that nice. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like gorgeous marble. Like, no, that was not six figures. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, vendors are complaining that Kamala's campaign stiffed them. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=700.52s)]
*  She still owes millions. You only get paid if you're Al Sharpton. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=704.76s)]
*  Half a million dollars went to the National Action Network. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=709.0s)]
*  Black churches are calling for the Reverend to be suspended from MSNBC. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=712.4s)]
*  They say Sharpton put a moral stain on the integrity of the black church. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=717.24s)]
*  And John Stewart says the media punk themselves. Listen, we appear to be [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=722.96s)]
*  in a transitional period where we are not sure about [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=727.2s)]
*  whether the ground we are standing on is solid. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  Although the news media seems convinced that we are [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=734.36s)]
*  the road runner and the coyote. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=739.36s)]
*  And the coyote has run over the cliff and we just looked down and realized [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=741.0s)]
*  there's nothing under our feet. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=745.08s)]
*  And now we are plunging to our deaths because the news media is always very [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  circumspect. We don't know what's going to happen when Donald Trump takes over. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=750.32s)]
*  But unfortunately, we can't see into the future, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=756.04s)]
*  but we have to be prepared for all outcomes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=760.24s)]
*  I don't know how helpful it is to get us [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=762.52s)]
*  in our pants this much this early. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=767.52s)]
*  Democrats are kicking dirt at Biden, Kamala, the media, the rev. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=770.96s)]
*  Tim Walz is just hiding in his garage. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=775.56s)]
*  Hey, everybody, Tim here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=778.4s)]
*  It's happy December winter in Minnesota. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=780.28s)]
*  So I am working in a garage that is somewhat heated. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=782.92s)]
*  But I have a couple of projects I was going to do. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=786.24s)]
*  Have to show them to you. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=788.6s)]
*  I got a 22 year old little E series BMW, kind of a neat little car. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=790.12s)]
*  But replacing the switches here, if you look on this on middle council, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=795.2s)]
*  this is the window, the window switches you're looking at right there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=799.8s)]
*  And they just didn't work anymore. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=803.24s)]
*  Didn't pull them up. They're kind of plug and play. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=805.28s)]
*  You can buy that part for 30 bucks. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=806.96s)]
*  Some things you just can't fix. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=809.12s)]
*  So Democrats are looking outside their party. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=810.92s)]
*  Eric Adams might be mega curious. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=813.8000000000001s)]
*  Would you ever consider rejoining the GOP? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=817.2s)]
*  The party that's the most important for me is the American Party. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=820.96s)]
*  I'm a part of the American party. I love this country. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=824.36s)]
*  This is the home of the free, the land of the brave. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=827.36s)]
*  And Doge is intriguing Federman. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=830.0s)]
*  I admire Mr. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=833.88s)]
*  Musk. He has been involved in very important parts of American society. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  A.I. SpaceX and other kinds of things. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=841.24s)]
*  Yes, he's on the on a different team, but that doesn't make me an enemy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=845.68s)]
*  I don't be automatically going to become a critic. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=851.2s)]
*  It's like, hey, he has made, you know, he's made our economy [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=854.68s)]
*  and our nation better and our politics are different. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=859.4s)]
*  And I don't agree with some of the things that he might say, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=862.6s)]
*  but that doesn't make him, like I said, an enemy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=865.04s)]
*  What you're seeing is certain Democrat [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=867.76s)]
*  politicians clear the way for Trump's team to revolutionize D.C. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=869.16s)]

*  feel left behind and forgotten. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=917.88s)]

*  actually care about them because we do. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDbaSEfZnI4&t=922.64s)]
