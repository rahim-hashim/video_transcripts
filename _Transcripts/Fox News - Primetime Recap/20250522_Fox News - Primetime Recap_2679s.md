# Fox News Highlights - May 21st, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg)
*  And now, defenders of deviance. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just convinced now they can't help themselves because when given the choice, liberals on and off the bench will always side with the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=6.0s)]
*  interests of illegal alien lawbreakers over the Constitution and the safety of the American people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=17.0s)]
*  This Judge Brian Murphy, a Biden appointee, just got put on the court in December and he sits on the federal district court in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=23.0s)]
*  Boston. He's very upset today, even hinting that the Trump DHS may be guilty of criminal contempt for carrying out the agenda [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=30.0s)]
*  that, of course, President Trump campaigned on, which was removing dangerous illegal aliens from the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=40.0s)]
*  Now, at a lengthy hearing today, Judge Murphy said it was impossible for these people to have a meaningful opportunity to object to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=46.0s)]
*  their transfer to South Sudan. Well, he indicated that even 24 hours notice would be inadequate and further that the department's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=55.0s)]
*  speedy removals were unquestionably violative of his earlier order. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=63.0s)]
*  Well, and this is precisely what they did yesterday when a deportation flight of eight criminal aliens landed in South Sudan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=67.0s)]
*  A top DHS official clapped back at the judge. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=75.0s)]
*  We are removing these convicted criminals from American soil so they can never hurt another American victim. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=79.0s)]
*  Now, a local judge in Massachusetts is trying to force the United States to bring back these uniquely barbaric monsters who present a clear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=85.0s)]
*  and present threat to the safety of the American people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=94.0s)]
*  It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is extremely frustrating. But right now, we don't seem to have a majority of justices who agree with the Trump administration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=107.0s)]
*  on this issue, at least when it comes to the due process issue involved. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=116.0s)]
*  Now, as a practical matter, lengthy hearings would mean that deportations would slow to a trickle. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=121.0s)]
*  And we're already way behind where we should be on deportations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=129.0s)]
*  Our commitment here at ICE remains the same, that we will remove the worst of the worst from your communities, including the list of people that are up on this board. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=133.0s)]
*  As we work every day to make the American people safer, we see activist judges stepping in a way that we have never seen before [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=141.0s)]
*  to put criminals first and not the American people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=149.0s)]
*  Okay. Another thing I've concluded, this is the role of Congress at this point. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=152.0s)]
*  They obviously need to step in here and establish some clear rules. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=158.0s)]
*  What is the process there? How much time should they have to appeal their decisions about where they're being deported? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=163.0s)]
*  What does it look like? What does the hearing look like? Is it a judge? Is it a magistrate? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=172.0s)]
*  Is it someone who can be appointed just temporarily in the immigration setting? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=177.0s)]
*  Congress needs to set these rules. Judges are not in a position to write these rules, nor should they be. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=181.0s)]
*  And the supposed conservative majority on the Supreme Court that liberals are always railing about, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=187.0s)]
*  they're not going to make deportations move any faster. Never going to happen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=192.0s)]
*  And by the way, who are these deportees that are deserving of all this due process? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=197.0s)]
*  Now, reading these activist judges' impassioned speeches, you might think, I mean, these are just poor migrants, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=203.0s)]
*  and they're just hardworking fry cooks or landscapers. Maybe they're your friendly construction workers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=209.0s)]
*  But here are their criminal resumes. Enrique Arias-Irerro from Cuba was convicted of homicide and armed robbery. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=216.0s)]
*  Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Cu√±ones, also of Cuba, convicted of attempted first degree murder, battery, larceny, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=224.0s)]
*  cocaine possession, and cocaine trafficking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=231.0s)]
*  Thongze Nicolote of Laos, excuse me, convicted of first degree murder and robbery. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=234.0s)]
*  Jesus Munoz Gutierrez of Mexico, convicted of second degree murder. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=240.0s)]
*  Dion Peter Domock of South Sudan, robbery, possession of a firearm, and burglars tools. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=245.0s)]
*  He also has a DUI under his belt. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=251.0s)]
*  And then there's Khoa Mya of Burma, lascivious acts with a child under the age of 12. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=253.0s)]
*  Let's not forget Ngo Myint, also of Burma, first degree sexual assault involving a victim mentally and physically incapable of resisting. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=260.0s)]
*  And finally, Duan Thanh Phan of Vietnam, first degree murder, second degree assault. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=270.0s)]
*  So, Republicans, you need to immediately move legislation to codify and fund proper removal procedures. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=279.0s)]
*  These individuals shouldn't be in the United States for a minute longer than is necessary. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=289.0s)]
*  It's time to put the Democrats on the defensive for standing up for, I'm just going to cut it, MRCT, murderers, rapists, and child traffickers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=295.0s)]
*  Congresswoman LaMonica McIver is already on her heels on the defensive. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=303.0s)]
*  She was charged with assault, you remember, in New Jersey a few days ago after her scuffle outside an ICE facility. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=308.0s)]
*  And at a hearing today, she was released on her own recognizance. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=314.0s)]
*  By the way, I saw this. She's already sent out a fundraising appeal after her arrest, claiming that, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=319.0s)]
*  I went to an ICE facility in my district to conduct oversight, because that's my job and my lawful right as a member of Congress. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=324.0s)]
*  Overfight? Maybe. Oversight? No. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=333.0s)]
*  But again, instead of working to rid New Jersey of its criminal element, an elected member of Congress is grandstanding for the cameras and for the criminals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=337.0s)]
*  And by the way, again, they're criminal aliens, no less. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=349.0s)]
*  Of course, when they don't have the facts on their side, Democrats, like the illegals themselves, play the victim. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=353.0s)]
*  Representative, can we talk to you about the charges brought against you? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=360.0s)]
*  Look, it's political intimidation and I'm looking forward to my day in court. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=363.0s)]
*  Nice speech. But even more revealing was what liberal loon Tim Wall said over the weekend, again, taking sides against law enforcement. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=368.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's modern-day Goscapo is scooping folks up off the streets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=379.0s)]
*  They're in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons. No chance to mount a defense. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=384.0s)]
*  I thought he said Gospacho. He got that mixed up with Gestapo. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=391.0s)]
*  All right. As he's spouting that, can you believe that guy was the vice presidential nominee? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=394.0s)]
*  DHS is arresting criminal illegals in his state. They've nabbed a murderer, a gang member and child sex offenders. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=399.0s)]
*  So this issue is horrific for the American people that we have to deal with this, pay money for this, but it's a gift to the GOP. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=408.0s)]
*  A new Marquette University poll, a law school poll, shows that Trump's approval numbers on border security are holding strong, 56 to 44. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=416.0s)]
*  And you know it's bad for the Democrats when even Jasmine Crockett knows it's time to pivot. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=425.0s)]
*  Republicans were right. Democrats lost on immigration. When you look at all the polling, when you talk to people, they lost on immigration. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=432.0s)]
*  Even Crockett knows what we've been reporting for years now. Americans are fed up with protecting illegals. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=441.0s)]
*  They're fed up with the scam. They're fed up with the budget busting effects of illegal immigration, not to speak of all the crime. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=448.0s)]
*  And those in the poorest communities that the Democrats, they want to tell us they care so much about. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=455.0s)]
*  For decades, they've been feeling the impacts of illegal aliens most directly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=461.0s)]
*  So look, I don't want to help the Democrats by giving them advice. They know what they should be doing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=467.0s)]
*  They used to believe in border enforcement. Let them continue down this path. It's a disastrous path. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=472.0s)]
*  And even their most dedicated base will eventually abandon them for the party that protects all Americans legally here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=479.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=487.0s)]
*  Treason at the highest level. That's what Trump's calling the Biden coverup. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=490.0s)]
*  And he says the people who lied to the country are treasonous thugs and wants their punishment to be very severe. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=495.0s)]
*  Now everybody in D.C. is trying to prove they're not Benedict Arnold. After hiding the evidence, now they're saying there was no evidence. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=502.0s)]
*  It was harder to get people to say anything. That's the point. It's hard. It's hard to get. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=511.0s)]
*  I mean, you need evidence for stories. But we were trying to crack this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=515.0s)]
*  Yeah. People outside of the Beltway saw evidence every day and they didn't need sources to know Biden's brain was shot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=519.0s)]
*  They just needed a TV. The Washington Post, a paper that has hundreds of reporters in the Capitol, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=527.0s)]
*  who has reporters following Biden around on his plane, are now saying, quote, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=534.0s)]
*  If Biden was too frail for his job, voters should have been informed. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah, by you. The paper that broke Watergate couldn't tell us Biden was a vegetable. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=545.0s)]
*  Informing the public is literally their job. And they're saying they couldn't do it because they were tricked. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=551.0s)]
*  We get phone calls at home where the guy is like pounding me because of op-eds that I wrote, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=558.0s)]
*  So, you know, I said that this was Biden at his best. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=564.0s)]
*  Sure. That's what I saw. I was obviously wrong. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=570.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure what my takeaway is here. Scarborough says he was wrong, but he's not sure what the takeaway is. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=576.0s)]
*  Journalists who act like they're smarter than anybody and they're saying they got duped by Binder. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=586.0s)]
*  Binder. They're saying, yeah, we really did think Biden was running circles around her. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=592.0s)]
*  All of the people pretending they got duped got book deals. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=598.0s)]
*  Well, what about the people who didn't get duped like me? What do I get? I don't want anything. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=602.0s)]
*  I don't need anything. I just need you to watch. And you do because I'm right. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=607.0s)]
*  As Limbaugh said, 99.8 percent of the time, even the Biden campaign couldn't believe how dumb D.C. was. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=612.0s)]
*  They were shocked that reporters believed the lies they told them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=621.0s)]
*  When you were reporting this, did people in his inner circle, did those that you talked to acknowledge that the media were they surprised by how complicit the media was? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=625.0s)]
*  It was interesting. I had one conversation with someone. This was after the election while we were reporting this book. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=635.0s)]
*  And this person said, listen, yes, we deserve blame for X, Y, Z. We were hiding him. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=640.0s)]
*  We were. But this person also sort of got my face and they said, listen, the media deserves some blame, too. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=647.0s)]
*  Like we were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin. You guys should not have believed us so easily. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=654.0s)]
*  The Biden White House was like, yeah, we were lying. But you idiots shouldn't have believed us. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=662.0s)]
*  We told you Joe was Hercules. The campaign didn't even think it'd be close. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=667.0s)]
*  They thought they could throw Trump in jail and keep Biden in the bunker. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=673.0s)]
*  They will say that the threat of Donald Trump made it so he didn't really have a choice. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=678.0s)]
*  And that being said, just given what we've seen of their actions and how they acted after the debate, I think he would have run anyway. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=685.0s)]
*  I mean, I think he spent most of 2023 him and Donald and President Biden and Mike Donald and spent most of 2023 convinced that Donald Trump was going to jail. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=692.0s)]
*  But throwing Trump in jail just made him more popular. So Nyquil Joe was forced out of hiding and his campaign spent millions staging fake town halls. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=702.0s)]
*  This fake town hall was in order to film it so they could make in the campaign commercials. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=712.0s)]
*  They filled it in. They filmed it in Delaware with supporters. But Joe Biden at this point, this is the spring of 2024. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=717.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's town hall, which was closed to press, was so bad that campaign officials determined that it was not usable for a campaign commercial. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=723.0s)]
*  So they took 90 minutes, two hours out of the president's day. They filmed an entire town hall and they determined that it was not usable. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=732.0s)]
*  Now, some people say this was because Joe Biden was incoherent. He could not really articulate his thoughts and apathy or even semi normal way. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=739.0s)]
*  Everybody knew how bad things really were. Some Democrats were worried about Biden years before. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=749.0s)]
*  During a trip to Ireland, one Democrat said Joe reminded him of his father right before he died. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=755.0s)]
*  Another Democrat said they were stunned to see Biden completely out of it at a White House Christmas party. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=763.0s)]
*  Every Democrat saw it, but they all zipped their lips. Even Kamala thought Joe was out of his mind. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=769.0s)]
*  Remember when Joe put on the Trump hat? She said, what is he doing? This is completely unhelpful and so unnecessary. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=775.0s)]
*  After that, they said, we're not campaigning with this guy ever again. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=784.0s)]
*  Biden was toxic. Now Democrats are saying Biden's foreign policy wasn't really his. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=789.0s)]
*  I look at the policy that we were able to pass, what we were able to do in the foreign policy space, reestablishing alliances. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=794.0s)]
*  We were doing a lot. Now, was that Joe Biden or was that the people around the bureau? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that was a ball of your. But I think he had really strong folks around him. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=807.0s)]
*  Now, yes, we can go back in hindsight and say maybe it wasn't the president that was doing this and maybe we should have asked questions. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=813.0s)]
*  Hmm. Biden wasn't even running his own White House. They say a small group of Biden insiders were running it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=820.0s)]
*  You know who was in charge? Hunter. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=827.0s)]
*  Well, I think Hunter was driving the decision making for the family in a way that people he was almost like a chief of staff. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=830.0s)]
*  I think he is provably demonstrably unethical, sleazy and prone to horrible decisions. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=837.0s)]
*  Tell me how you really feel. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=844.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I just just look at the record. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=846.0s)]
*  I mean, after his brother died, he cheated on his wife with his brother's widow and then got her addicted to crack. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=849.0s)]
*  Tapper just said a sleazy criminal hooked on crack was running the country. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=855.0s)]
*  But when we said that, Tapper said, no, that's just a cruel conspiracy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=859.0s)]
*  The right wing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about Biden and his family. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=865.0s)]
*  Too disgusting to even repeat here. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=871.0s)]
*  I mean, some of the ones I've seen from the president's son and the president, some of the president's supporters are just wildly unhinged. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=874.0s)]
*  Unhinged. OK. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=882.0s)]
*  Well, what's Tapper's next book going to be called? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=884.0s)]
*  Biden's border crisis? How Democrats imported millions of voters? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=888.0s)]
*  How much is he going to get paid for that? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=893.0s)]
*  Because when conservatives write a book, they're not even allowed on most mainstream shows to promote it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=895.0s)]
*  Tapper is everywhere. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=901.0s)]
*  So the question is why? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=904.0s)]
*  Well, the media is trying to scapegoat the Biden family while they clean up the rest of the crime scene. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=906.0s)]
*  They knew all along they were in the middle of a cover up and didn't say a thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=913.0s)]
*  But when did Biden find out he had cancer? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=917.0s)]
*  They said he found out Friday. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=920.0s)]
*  But at this point, we can't believe anything they say. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=923.0s)]
*  Biden said he had cancer three years ago. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=926.0s)]
*  Because it was a four lane highway that was accessible. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=930.0s)]
*  My mother drove us and rather than us be able to walk. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=934.0s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=938.0s)]
*  The first frost, you know, what was happening? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=940.0s)]
*  You had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=943.0s)]
*  That's why I had so damn many other people I grew up have cancer. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=948.0s)]
*  And why can't for the longest time, Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=952.0s)]
*  Was he talking about prostate cancer, skin cancer? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=957.0s)]
*  Because he said this before they caught his skin cancer. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=961.0s)]
*  So what cancer was he talking about? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=965.0s)]
*  Was that a gaffe? Was he telling the truth? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=967.0s)]
*  How long have they been lying to us? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=970.0s)]
*  Biden had an enlarged prostate over 10 years ago and they just stopped testing them? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=973.0s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=979.0s)]
*  The question now is why haven't we heard from Biden's doctor? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=981.0s)]
*  Why are unnamed Biden sources telling us about Biden's cancer? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=985.0s)]
*  Shouldn't doctors be making these statements? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=990.0s)]
*  Not anonymous sources out of Delaware. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=993.0s)]
*  No one wants to put their names to this story. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=996.0s)]
*  Maybe because there's more to this story. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=999.0s)]
*  I mean, I still feel that Jake and I, and Jake I think agrees, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1002.0s)]
*  that this is only the first draft of the story and it's going to continue on. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1006.0s)]
*  But tonight we begin with a story that will not and should not go away for, well, history, forever. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1011.0s)]
*  Democrats, their friends in the state-run legacy media mob, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1019.0s)]
*  they worked in unison to cover up Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1022.0s)]
*  This was a brazen attempt, frankly a conspiracy to use a phrase, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1028.0s)]
*  to deceive all of you, to deceive the American people. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1032.0s)]
*  They hated Donald Trump so much that they were more than willing to put Americans at risk, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1037.0s)]
*  handing over the keys to our country and our nuclear arsenal [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1043.0s)]
*  to someone that they knew was in a steep cognitive decline. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1046.0s)]
*  Nearly every elected Democrat, every White House official, every Biden family member, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1050.0s)]
*  every single so-called journalist, they lied over and over and over and over again. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1055.0s)]
*  This is the single biggest, most widespread political White House scandal in our lifetime. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1063.0s)]
*  No other way to describe this. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1070.0s)]
*  And it was also the dumbest lie ever told. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1072.0s)]
*  They asked all of you not to believe your lying eyes and your lying ears. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1075.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, we simply reported the obvious truth here on this program. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1080.0s)]
*  My humble advice to every American watching tonight is forever, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1085.0s)]
*  you cannot trust fake news CNN, MSDNC. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1089.0s)]
*  You can't trust the broadcast channels, ABC, CBS, NBC. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1093.0s)]
*  Stop reading the New York Times. Stop reading the Washington Post. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1097.0s)]
*  Stop listening to NPR. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1101.0s)]
*  And frankly, you can get your news right here on this show, on Fox News, talk radio, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1104.0s)]
*  maybe podcasters that you like, know and trust. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1109.0s)]
*  You might not always agree with my political beliefs, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1112.0s)]
*  but we're not going to spend five years lying to your face. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1115.0s)]
*  We told you the truth about Russia collusion. They lied. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1119.0s)]
*  We told you the truth about the evaluation of Mar-a-Lago. They lied. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1123.0s)]
*  We told you the truth about Joe Biden's cognitive decline. They lied. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1127.0s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the timeline, shall we? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1131.0s)]
*  Let us begin in 2019, the very beginning of Joe Biden's presidential campaign. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1135.0s)]
*  From the very moment that he threw his hat in the ring, something seemed off. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1140.0s)]
*  Let's take a trip down memory lane. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1145.0s)]
*  If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330. We choose truth over facts. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1148.0s)]
*  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1156.0s)]
*  Play the radio. Make sure the television, excuse me, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1160.0s)]
*  make sure you have the record player on at night. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1163.0s)]
*  The phone. Make sure the kids hear words. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1166.0s)]
*  This was not the Vice President Biden that you were all familiar with. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1170.0s)]
*  It was clear. It was obvious. It was self-evident. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1175.0s)]
*  Joe didn't talk the same. He didn't walk the same. He didn't look the same. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1179.0s)]
*  Way back in August of 2019, it was obvious to me that Joe Biden was in a decline. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1183.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what we reported right here on this show. Take a look. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1188.0s)]
*  While his allies are trying to downplay it, there is a panic. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1192.0s)]
*  All Joe being Joe, the verbal mishaps are piling up by the second, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1196.0s)]
*  raising serious questions among Democrats about his viability. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1202.0s)]
*  Well, let's just put it this way. I would argue that David Axelrod is right. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1206.0s)]
*  That's probably the best you're going to get out of Sleepy Creepy Uncle Joe. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1210.0s)]
*  He's losing his fastball. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1214.0s)]
*  I am in a little better shape. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1216.0s)]
*  Anyway, unfortunately, anyone who dared to speak the truth was excoriated [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1218.0s)]
*  by the left-wing legacy media mob. Take a look. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1224.0s)]
*  When he was on the stage, the decision he made in the moment was an unsubtle allusion to Alzheimer's or ageism. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1228.0s)]
*  Now, if he thinks that's winning, good luck. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1235.0s)]
*  And if he thinks that the notion that, you know, again, people have talked about Joe Biden's weaknesses as a candidate, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1239.0s)]
*  if you actually think he's weak, then he'll fall on his own sort of time. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1246.0s)]
*  Now, a year later, let's follow the timeline. In 2020, the same pattern continued. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1251.0s)]
*  Now, if you are a loyal viewer to this program for any length of time, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1257.0s)]
*  you are very, very familiar with this alarming moment from then-candidate Joe Biden. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1262.0s)]
*  You know, created by the thing, you know, the thing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1268.0s)]
*  God, the creator of everything. Take a look. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1272.0s)]
*  It's time for America to get back up on its feet and once again fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1276.0s)]
*  Sounds corny. Not a joke. Think about it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1283.0s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1286.0s)]
*  All men and women created by the go, you know the thing. You know how we talk about it. Are we the people? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1289.0s)]
*  Corny. Not a joke. Think about it. The thing, the thing. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1296.0s)]
*  Once again, we observed the truth and immediately we told you, our viewers, a reminder. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1301.0s)]
*  As a voter, it is fair for every American to ask whether or not this 78-year-old has the strength, the stamina, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1309.0s)]
*  the focus and the capacity to handle what is by far the toughest job in the world. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1317.0s)]
*  Now to me, quid pro quo Joe seems to be in a rapid state of decline and not up to the rigors needed even on a campaign. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1322.0s)]
*  Now over there on fake news CNN, the reporting was much different. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1329.0s)]
*  Instead of telling you that the people that watch, the very few people that watch that network, well, they spread blatant lies, propaganda, misinformation. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1333.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1343.0s)]
*  This is Joe Biden out there on a vigorous bike ride. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1344.0s)]
*  Not wearing a helmet, but definitely wearing a mask, by the way. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1349.0s)]
*  Fox's narrative and talk radio's narrative for months has been that Joe Biden is falling apart. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1352.0s)]
*  You just heard Ben Shapiro say it. Falling apart. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1359.0s)]
*  And there he is riding a bike out for a bike ride. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1362.0s)]
*  Humpty Dumpty, you want to take that back? Don't forget Humpty Dumpty tells everyone he's a reporter, which is another lie. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1366.0s)]
*  None of these people are, quote, journalists, as they claim. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1373.0s)]
*  They are leftist activists, talk show hosts that are merely part of the Democratic machine. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1377.0s)]
*  Frankly, nothing more than an extension of their press offices. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1383.0s)]
*  They're not honest about who they are. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1387.0s)]
*  And that brings us to 2021 and our timeline. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1389.0s)]
*  Biden got a year older and his mental condition got even worse. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1392.0s)]
*  We observed obvious mental fog, too many gaffes to count. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1397.0s)]
*  And to top it all off, Joe barely ever did unscripted presses. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1401.0s)]
*  Let me go to Sam, who's going to ask me about the budget. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1405.0s)]
*  I mean, that's how it went down. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1410.0s)]
*  And he spent most of his weekends in Delaware, could barely even drag his beach chair around. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1412.0s)]
*  But according to MSDNC, competence was at the helm. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1417.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1421.0s)]
*  We cannot downplay the comfort that some of us feel in the country. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1423.0s)]
*  That government is actually working, or at least trying to work. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1428.0s)]
*  That competence is actually at the helm. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1432.0s)]
*  More lies from the state run legacy media mob. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1435.0s)]
*  Let's go to 2022. Joe Biden's decline. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1439.0s)]
*  It continued. Take a look at your screen. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1442.0s)]
*  Dazed and confused, Joe Biden mumbling, bumbling, stumbling. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1444.0s)]
*  He barely looked at this case, get his jacket on without help from Dr. Jill. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1448.0s)]
*  But again, anyone who reported the truth, we were viciously attacked. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1453.0s)]
*  We were accused of ageism. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1458.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1460.0s)]
*  What about the respect for elders thing that we talk about? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1462.0s)]
*  Because we treat, I think, our elderly people not, we don't support them and honor them as much as other countries. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1465.0s)]
*  Is there, and it's a little bit difficult sometimes to talk about these issues and to speak of a president that way. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1472.0s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought that up. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1477.0s)]
*  I think one of the biggest challenges we face is ageism, right? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1479.0s)]
*  Fake news, CNN running cover once again. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1482.0s)]
*  A year later, 2023, Biden was on MSDNC and for some reason he just got up and wandered off the set while the show was live on air. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1485.0s)]
*  It was just I'm leaving now. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1496.0s)]
*  Just walked off the set. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1498.0s)]
*  The legacy media mob still lie to your face. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1500.0s)]
*  In fact, CNN continue to blame Biden's lifelong stutter. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1503.0s)]
*  Nobody ever talked about his stutter for his unusual behavior. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1507.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1511.0s)]
*  President Biden does have word finding difficulties. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1512.0s)]
*  He does. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1515.0s)]
*  I mean, we can whenever anytime you hear him in a speech, he does them. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1516.0s)]
*  And I don't know if that's his stutter or if that's the prompter. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1519.0s)]
*  He does. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1522.0s)]
*  And as you know, his critics seize on that. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1523.0s)]
*  And this brings us to 2024, Biden's last year as your so-called president. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1526.0s)]
*  Was he really? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1531.0s)]
*  Anyway, as most of you know, Joe Biden was an utter train wreck. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1532.0s)]
*  He barely worked, took a lot of naps, including during public meetings. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1535.0s)]
*  Let's call a lid at eight o'clock in the morning, meaning you won't see the [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1539.0s)]
*  president for the rest of the day. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1543.0s)]
*  He wandered off. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1544.0s)]
*  Remember, during the G7 meeting in France, while other world leaders [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1545.0s)]
*  anxiously looked on, come on, Joe, let me let me steer you back to where you [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1549.0s)]
*  belong. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1553.0s)]
*  He also seemed completely lost during a Juneteenth concert, looking off into [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1554.0s)]
*  the distance without, you know, with a thousand yard stare of his. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1559.0s)]
*  At one point in 2024, he even walked straight into a jungle. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1563.0s)]
*  During a trip to Latin America, I'm gonna go for a walk. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1568.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, we showed you all of this very real footage. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1572.0s)]
*  Remember, you would shake air and you didn't know whether to go exit left or [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1576.0s)]
*  exit right. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1580.0s)]
*  He had no idea somebody after, oh, come on, Joe, we'll walk you off the stage. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1581.0s)]
*  You know, we would show you this footage day in, day out, night in, night out. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1584.0s)]
*  While the other media outlets accused us of producing what they called cheap [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1589.0s)]
*  fake videos. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1594.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1595.0s)]
*  We're hearing about so-called cheap fakes. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1596.0s)]
*  It's playing out on right wing media, Fox, New York Post and so on. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1599.0s)]
*  And all of this is to try to make the case that Biden is slipping, he's [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1603.0s)]
*  confused and so on. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1607.0s)]
*  There are a lot of videos going around about President Biden on social media, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1608.0s)]
*  which ones are real, which ones are deceptively edited, now being called [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1612.0s)]
*  cheap fakes. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1616.0s)]
*  A lot of memes and what the White House is calling cheap fakes. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1617.0s)]
*  Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1622.0s)]
*  They're cheap. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1624.0s)]
*  They're just distorted, out of context videos, chopped up in certain ways, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1625.0s)]
*  constructed in certain ways. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1629.0s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1630.0s)]
*  That's what the Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried about [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1631.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1634.0s)]
*  That's June of twenty-four. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1635.0s)]
*  They had four long years to figure out what we figured out in twenty-nineteen. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1637.0s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1643.0s)]
*  March of twenty-twenty-four, liberal Joe, our old friend, proclaiming Joe [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1644.0s)]
*  Biden was his best self intellectually, analytically. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1649.0s)]
*  What planet is he living on? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1653.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1655.0s)]
*  Start your tape right now, because I'm about to tell you the truth. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1656.0s)]
*  And F you if you can't handle the truth. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1660.0s)]
*  This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1664.0s)]
*  Not a close second. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1673.0s)]
*  And I've known him for years. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1674.0s)]
*  The Brzezinski's have known him for fifty years. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1676.0s)]
*  If it weren't the truth, I wouldn't say it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1679.0s)]
*  Hey, Joe, I could use your words. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1682.0s)]
*  F you for lying, lying to the American people. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1685.0s)]
*  Even after Biden's disastrous debate performance in twenty-twenty-four, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1689.0s)]
*  there was still some on fake news CNN making excuses for Joe until he was [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1693.0s)]
*  officially out of the presidential race. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1699.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1701.0s)]
*  In several events since the CNN debate, President Biden has appeared [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1702.0s)]
*  vigorous. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1707.0s)]
*  He has had a really busy jam packed schedule where you haven't seen what we [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1709.0s)]
*  all saw on the debate stage. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1716.0s)]
*  He never had a jam packed schedule. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1718.0s)]
*  My big question tonight, if Democrats, their friends in the state run [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1721.0s)]
*  legacy media mob are willing to lie so blatantly about all of this, what [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1726.0s)]
*  won't they lie about? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1731.0s)]
*  As it turns out, their rampant dishonesty extends to almost everything. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1733.0s)]
*  I don't have time to list every lie. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1738.0s)]
*  They have done nothing but lie and lie again and again and peddle one [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1741.0s)]
*  conspiracy theory about Donald Trump after another. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1746.0s)]
*  And they even got Pulitzer prizes for lying. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1749.0s)]
*  And they won't give him back. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1752.0s)]
*  It's repulsive. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1754.0s)]
*  It is corrupt. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1755.0s)]
*  It is the biggest presidential scandal in history. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1756.0s)]
*  Well, right up there. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1761.0s)]
*  Here's one quick example. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1762.0s)]
*  This is fake Jake Tapper defending Hunter Biden in 1920 and 23. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1764.0s)]
*  Now he's criticizing him. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1768.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1770.0s)]
*  Whatever you think of Hunter Biden, and there's certainly a lot of people in [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1771.0s)]
*  this town, Democrats and Republicans, that do not think a lot of him, there [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1774.0s)]
*  is a certain kind of like cruelty to the campaign against him. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1778.0s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1782.0s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1783.0s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1784.0s)]
*  The right wing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about Biden and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1785.0s)]
*  his family. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1789.0s)]
*  Too disgusting to even repeat here. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1790.0s)]
*  I mean, some of the ones I've seen from the president's son and the president, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1793.0s)]
*  some of the president's supporters are just wildly unhinged. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1797.0s)]
*  I think that you came here and leveled a bunch of accusations and allegations [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1801.0s)]
*  about Hunter Biden. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1805.0s)]
*  I didn't level. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1807.0s)]
*  I just said the facts. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1808.0s)]
*  Now, that was before Biden's exit from public life. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1810.0s)]
*  Now here's fake Jake admitting the truth. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1813.0s)]
*  He's trying to make money selling a book. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1816.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1818.0s)]
*  Well, I think Hunter was driving the decision making for the family in a way [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1819.0s)]
*  that people, he was almost like a chief of staff of the family. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1823.0s)]
*  Does that strike you as pretty bizarre? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1827.0s)]
*  It's bizarre because I think he is provably, demonstrably unethical, sleazy [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1829.0s)]
*  and prone to horrible decisions. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1835.0s)]
*  Tell me how you really feel. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1837.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I just look at the record. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1839.0s)]
*  I mean, after his brother died, he cheated on his wife with his brother's widow [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1842.0s)]
*  and then got her addicted to crack. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1846.0s)]
*  That's just one thing I could say. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1848.0s)]
*  I mean, there are, I don't have a lot of personal regard for him. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1850.0s)]
*  And I have no personal regard for you either, fake Jake. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1856.0s)]
*  You're trying to make money criticizing the very lying that you are a huge part of. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1860.0s)]
*  Why would anyone buy that book or trust anyone at Fake News CNN ever, ever again? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1864.0s)]
*  They pretend to be honest, purveyors of truth, and that is a lie. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1871.0s)]
*  But of course, it's not just the media, as Peter Ducey can report firsthand. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1876.0s)]
*  Then Biden White House at that time was a house of cards, built on lies and smears. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1881.0s)]
*  He's the only one I recall calling it out regularly. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1887.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1890.0s)]
*  President Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1891.0s)]
*  Why does White House staff treat him like a baby? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1895.0s)]
*  No one treats the president of the United States, the commander in chief, like a baby. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1898.0s)]
*  So there's this book that says... [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1902.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1903.0s)]
*  That's a ridiculous claim. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1904.0s)]
*  How is President Biden ever going to convince the three quarters of voters who are worried about his physical and mental health that he is OK, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1905.0s)]
*  even though in Las Vegas he told a story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1912.0s)]
*  I'm not even going to go down that rabbit hole with you, sir. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1919.0s)]
*  One of the reasons you were not charged is because in his description you are a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1922.0s)]
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1931.0s)]
*  I've been president. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1935.0s)]
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1939.0s)]
*  My memory is so bad I can let you speak. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1944.0s)]
*  All right, let's do a monologue. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1948.0s)]
*  So it appears the grownups are back. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1950.0s)]
*  Suddenly Washington has rediscovered what an actual boss looks like. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1952.0s)]
*  And what happens when you have a great boss? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1956.0s)]
*  The bossness trickles down. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1959.0s)]
*  Now we finally got cabinet members who aren't as competent. They're kicking ass. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1961.0s)]
*  Take Marco Rubio, whose transformation reminds us of when the Incredible Hulk gets angry or when Judge Jeanine loses a shoe. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1965.0s)]
*  Here's Marco taking Chris Van Alen to the short bus. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1974.0s)]
*  I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you for Secretary of State. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1978.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, your regret for voting for me confirms I'm doing a good job. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1983.0s)]
*  In the case of El Salvador, absolutely, absolutely. We deported gang members, gang members, including the one you had a margarita with. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1987.0s)]
*  And that guy is a human trafficker and that guy is a gang banger and the evidence is going to be clear. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=1994.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, please, Secretary Rubio has the floor. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2000.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, he can't make unsubstantiated comments like that. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2005.0s)]
*  Secretary Rubio has the floor. You had your time. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2008.0s)]
*  Secretary Rubio should take that testimony, the federal floor, to the United States because he hasn't done it under oath. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2011.0s)]
*  Here's another point, okay? There is a division in our government between the federal branch and the judicial branch. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2015.0s)]
*  No judge and the judicial branch cannot tell me or the president how to conduct foreign policy. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2022.0s)]
*  I haven't seen a mismatch like that since Randy Weingarten sat on a chair. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2027.0s)]
*  And it's only possible when you got the wind of Trump at your back and no fear of the wind coming from the flatulent left-wing mob. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2036.0s)]
*  And Rubio is not alone. The entire cast of unintimidated ass-kickers is growing real fast. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2043.0s)]
*  Just take a look at this murderer's row. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2049.0s)]
*  If I offend anybody today, I don't give a s***. I don't give a s*** what you think about me. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2052.0s)]
*  Our people are now the sickest people in the world because you have not done your job. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2058.0s)]
*  If you don't care about wasting tax dollars, Senator Ricketts does. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2064.0s)]
*  And the problem... [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2067.0s)]
*  And I'm gonna do my job because the American public... [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2068.0s)]
*  And the problem... [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2070.0s)]
*  ...cares about us not wasting tax dollars. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2071.0s)]
*  If you want to talk about someone who was attacked by a weaponized bureau, you're looking at him. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2073.0s)]
*  And now he's the director of the FBI and he's cleaning it up. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2077.0s)]
*  I don't really care, Margaret. I don't want that person in my country, and I think most Americans agree with me. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2079.0s)]
*  No more pronouns. No more climate change obsession. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2085.0s)]
*  No more emergency vaccine mandates. No more dudes in dresses. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2090.0s)]
*  We're done with that s***. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2098.0s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2099.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2101.0s)]
*  Tell you what, I haven't seen so many bad asses since Kudlow had his 80th birthday at a nude beach. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2105.0s)]
*  But all of them are energized because they know something changed. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2115.0s)]
*  Trump's back. And he has your back, so they've showed up to fight. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2121.0s)]
*  Now let's contrast that with Team Biden, the island of misfit DEI hires. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2125.0s)]
*  Last year's starting lineup, Kamala Harris, the border czar, who managed to make the border worse. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2130.0s)]
*  But by losing to Trump, she proves drinking does make your problems go away. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2136.0s)]
*  Remember Mayorkas? The guy threw his own agents under the bus, lied about having control of the border, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2142.0s)]
*  and on top of that looks like a ball sack after a fresh waxing. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2148.0s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg went on a three month paternity leave before they even knew he was gone, let alone pregnant. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2160.0s)]
*  This guy was as useless as crowd control at a Jesse Waters book signing. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2168.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken became a Nero in mom jeans, playing guitar while our foreign policy burned. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2175.0s)]
*  13 service members died under his watch. Luckily his boss totally forgot about it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2182.0s)]
*  Lloyd Austin, our defense secretary, hid that he had prostate cancer. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2187.0s)]
*  Hmm, where have we heard that before? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2191.0s)]
*  Do you realize that means at one point our military had no commander in chief and no secretary of defense? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2194.0s)]
*  If Aruba decided to invade us, we would have been f***ed. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2201.0s)]
*  But I guess that's how you get a mentally ill dude in charge of nuclear waste who moonlights as a luggage thief. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2206.0s)]
*  Under Biden, staffers were taking it in the ass at a senate conference room and filming it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2212.0s)]
*  I was not there. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2221.0s)]
*  And what about Binder, right, whose job was to sell us all this s***? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2225.0s)]
*  She instilled confidence in this administration the way the View instills confidence in Weight Watchers. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2230.0s)]
*  Didn't matter because the media played along. Hell, they carried so much water, camels tried to have sex with them. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2238.0s)]
*  But there was no top guy and it showed with the rest of these clock watchers. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2246.0s)]
*  When your boss inspires naps instead of nerve, success is never an option because failure is expected. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2250.0s)]
*  I think the Biden administration's motto was, we do less before 9 a.m. than dead people do all day. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2256.0s)]
*  But now it's changed. Entire departments, they're not worried about disappointing the media or the bureaucrats. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2264.0s)]
*  They want to please Trump and by extension all of us. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2270.0s)]
*  Trump knows leadership doesn't come from special days, hashtags and platitudes about inclusion. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2273.0s)]
*  It comes from expectations, it comes from pressure and a vision for what's great. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2278.0s)]
*  Which is why we went from a president who forgot names to a White House who's kicking ass and taking them. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2283.0s)]
*  His wardrobe is sometimes used to wake coma patients. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2296.0s)]
*  Host of Making Money on Fox Business, Charles P. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2300.0s)]
*  His idea of a hot foursome is a barbershop quartet. Fox News contributor Tom Shalhou. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2302.0s)]
*  They say laughter is the best medicine which is why he's banned from hospitals. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2311.0s)]
*  Actor and comedian Steve Byrne. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2317.0s)]
*  And she's our favorite, Madison. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2322.0s)]
*  After James and Square Garden. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2324.0s)]
*  Fox Business correspondent Madison Alworth. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2327.0s)]
*  Charles, it's kind of funny watching Rubio kind of transform from a little Marco to murderous Marco. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2332.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I loved it. I loved it. I do disagree with one part. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2342.0s)]
*  That was an amazing monologue. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2346.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2347.0s)]
*  My orcas. I think he looks like a ball sack but not after the polishing. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2348.0s)]
*  That needs a good polishing. That's all. That's the only way I disagree. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2353.0s)]
*  It is tough. He does look like, yeah, he looks like he has a few straight hairs. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2356.0s)]
*  Little wrinkles. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2360.0s)]
*  So, you know, I'm a big boxing fan. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2365.0s)]
*  And when Holi, Holi Phil was coming up, one of his biggest fights, he moved up to cruiserweight. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2367.0s)]
*  He was fighting this guy named Ricky Parquet. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2371.0s)]
*  Now before the fight, they asked Ricky Parquet, what are you going to do? This guy is tough, you know. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2373.0s)]
*  He said, I ain't going to tell you my strategy. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2377.0s)]
*  But when I do like that, that's called the slam-a-jamma. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2379.0s)]
*  So third round, Holyfield's whipping his ass. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2382.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, Parquet goes down. He looks over and the camera goes. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2386.0s)]
*  I swear, Chris Holland did the same thing. Don't not hear it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2390.0s)]
*  He looked over one time and he's like, Rubio's whipping my ass. Slam-a-jamma, slam-a-jamma. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2395.0s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2401.0s)]
*  It was not pretty because Rubio's been on the other side. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2402.0s)]
*  He knew what to do and Van Holland, I keep thinking of Van Halen, but they're much better. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2406.0s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. Tom, what is it about? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2412.0s)]
*  What is it about? You work with me and you know what a boss I am and how great my staff is, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2415.0s)]
*  which is reflective of my leadership abilities. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2420.0s)]
*  Very true. All true. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2423.0s)]
*  Is that what's going on here? They're drawing inspiration from the guy in charge? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2425.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And you know, Greg is a perfect example of this. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2429.0s)]
*  But they're taking your steam away, Greg. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2432.0s)]
*  You were the only right-wing guy out there who was slaying it, who was making jokes about the left. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2434.0s)]
*  Now Trump and all of his administration is in on the game. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2440.0s)]
*  I mean, these hearings, these stupid hearings, I mean, I'm so glad. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2444.0s)]
*  They cracked the code on this thing. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2448.0s)]
*  They just come back at him like it's a Kill Tony podcast and they roast them back. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2449.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2454.0s)]
*  Because the whole idea of this, they use decorum against these people. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2455.0s)]
*  So they said, you know, because of Robert's Rules of Order and the parliamentary procedure, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2458.0s)]
*  they could say whatever they wanted and the person just had to sit there and take it. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2463.0s)]
*  So whenever we saw these hearings, the people would just be sitting there like idiots as the senators laid into them. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2466.0s)]
*  Now they come back at him. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2474.0s)]
*  Rubio was like, you know, that crack about the margarita. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2475.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2477.0s)]
*  And it made that guy look like an idiot. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2478.0s)]
*  So Van Holland is like, I demand you take that back. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2479.0s)]
*  It was not a margarita. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2481.0s)]
*  It was a mojito. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2482.0s)]
*  Madison, did you catch the crazy stuff today with the South African president? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2487.0s)]
*  All that stuff? Was that incredible? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2492.0s)]
*  It is amazing how much we're seeing that we never used to see before at these hearings. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2494.0s)]
*  C-SPAN is now interesting. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2500.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the curtains have just been pulled wide open. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2502.0s)]
*  We can see everything on full display. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2505.0s)]
*  It's like when I sneak into the gap. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2507.0s)]
*  Anyway, go ahead. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2511.0s)]
*  It's incredible transparency, which I think is what makes this all so wild because not Van Holland, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2512.0s)]
*  Van Holland was upset saying, okay, bring this in front of the judiciary. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2519.0s)]
*  And of course, Rubio was saying, no, just because I'm actually talking to world leaders doesn't mean that you get to get in on the secret sauce. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2523.0s)]
*  It's like asking the popular kids at the table, like, hey, you got to share with all of us. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2529.0s)]
*  No, just because former president, President Biden was falling asleep at G20 meetings, missing these dinners. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2533.0s)]
*  He didn't have any information to share. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2539.0s)]
*  Now we do. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2541.0s)]
*  We open up the curtain as wide as possible, but some things still have to remain a secret. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2542.0s)]
*  And I love the way that Rubio handled that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2546.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought he was great. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2548.0s)]
*  You know, Steve, it's good to see you. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2549.0s)]
*  Are you still selling newspapers on the corner of 6th Avenue? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2550.0s)]
*  Actually in Tiananmen Square. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2554.0s)]
*  No, I look that Rubio was inspiring. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2558.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2560.0s)]
*  And it's like to Tom's point, it's like once it's in the ether, it's like, yeah, I take it back. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2561.0s)]
*  It's like it's already on Twitter. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2564.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what people remember. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2565.0s)]
*  But Trump got in there. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2567.0s)]
*  He's not joking around. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2568.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, deported upwards of in three months to like 100 over 100,000 illegal immigrants back out of this country. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2570.0s)]
*  And if he keeps up at this rate, like who's going to be left to root for the Raiders? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2577.0s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2581.0s)]
*  There's a he's deported all these people. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2584.0s)]
*  And so what the progressives and left are demanding is due process, due process, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2588.0s)]
*  Court. So let's back it up. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2593.0s)]
*  Let's spend millions of dollars on the courts. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2594.0s)]
*  It's like that's why I think Trump went in and open Alcatraz. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2596.0s)]
*  It's no more El Salvador in prison. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2599.0s)]
*  It's going to go to Alcatraz. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2601.0s)]
*  It is going to rename Bar Lago. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2602.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2605.0s)]
*  It's going to be a beautiful jail, Greg. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2606.0s)]
*  It's going to be a wonderful jail. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2608.0s)]
*  They're going to love my jail. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2610.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, the inmates love my jail. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2612.0s)]
*  The inmates know the inmates said to me, Greg, the inmates, when their sentence is up, they say, I don't want to leave. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2614.0s)]
*  I want to stay. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2619.0s)]
*  I don't want you to leave. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2622.0s)]
*  Nicely done. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2630.0s)]
*  You know what the prison guards tell me? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2631.0s)]
*  The prison guards, they say, I want to be an inmate. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2633.0s)]
*  That's what they say to me. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2637.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2643.0s)]
*  That was beautiful. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2644.0s)]
*  Before we go, come see me on tour with special guest Tom Shalhou. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2645.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2649.0s)]
*  We will be in not good, but Grand Rapids, Michigan. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2650.0s)]
*  And we're going to head out to Rockford, Illinois the next month, then Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Arizona, and Texas later in the year. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2657.0s)]
*  Go to GGudfeld.gov for tickets. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbm5V1wF2Rg&t=2664.0s)]
