# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 11, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo)
*  Now for the hard part. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. All weekend long, I was still kind of processing, like many of you, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=9.84s)]
*  Trump's historic comeback, the bogus lawsuits, the frivolous indictments, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=13.96s)]
*  the relentless defamation, Kamala's $1.2 billion war chest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=19.32s)]
*  I mean, not even two assassination attempts could break him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Even his most strident critics are recognizing the opportunity he has to reshape Washington. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=28.64s)]
*  He swept every battleground state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=36.92s)]
*  He increased his margins in New York and California. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=39.04s)]
*  Trump is riding into Washington, whether anyone, I mean, just the political reality [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=42.64s)]
*  is that he is politically as dominant and strong as he's ever been. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Holy Toledo. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=53.08s)]
*  All right. Trump gained ground in 49 states and the District of Columbia. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=54.56s)]
*  But of course, the question is, how much support can President Trump get on Capitol Hill? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Because, look, he outperformed pretty much every Republican who ran this go-around. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=66.8s)]
*  Trump's agenda, which he specifically campaigned on, should be the Republican agenda. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=72.08s)]
*  And his focus was not just the border, not just the economy, but our trade policy, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  our defense policy, too. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=84.4s)]
*  So given that the GOP likely controls both houses of Congress, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=86.72s)]
*  it'll be a narrow majority in the House, it's realistic that Trump voters expect his policies [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=90.76s)]
*  to be swiftly moved through Congress. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=96.72s)]
*  But at a minimum, and I mean a bare minimum, President Trump should be able to rely on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Republicans that he helped to regain the majority in the Senate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't have beaten Sherrod Brown without Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't have beaten Casey without Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=114.12s)]
*  Or maybe not even John Tester without Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=117.72s)]
*  And under these circumstances, especially again, with that small House majority, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=121.92s)]
*  the position of the Senate majority leader is even more critical. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=127.72s)]
*  Now, just so you all understand this, and there's no reason you would have to know the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=132.72s)]
*  intricacies of Hill inner workings here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=136.52s)]
*  But as a practical matter, no bill can get to the floor of the Senate and no amendments [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=139.64s)]
*  can be put on that bill and voted on in the Senate without the support of the majority [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=145.55999999999997s)]
*  leader. It just does not happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  That's why Mitch McConnell is so powerful. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  Now, right now, there are three candidates for the position, two of them, John Thune [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  from South Dakota and John Cornyn from Texas, are both seen as disciples of Mitch [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=159.88s)]
*  McConnell, and both have a history of being fairly critical of President Trump, who [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=165.08s)]
*  they'd prefer not wade into the internal Senate deliberations at all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=170.84s)]
*  My preference would be, and I think it's probably in his best interest, to stay out of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=177.08s)]
*  that. These Senate secret ballot elections are probably best left to senators, and he's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=180.52s)]
*  got to work with all of us when it's all said and done. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=186.28s)]
*  Now, I understand why the Senate wants to preserve its independence. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  I get it. But at the same time, let's be real. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=193.72s)]
*  They all owe their majority status to him, Donald Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=197.84s)]
*  And think about it, when McConnell worked with the MAGA Republicans and the MAGA agenda, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=203.8s)]
*  like on court nominations, the USMCA, the tax bill, they got stuff done. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=209.48s)]
*  It was great. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=216.68s)]
*  But when they're at cross purposes, as you saw with that Langford Schumer immigration [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=218.28s)]
*  bill, that fiasco or the absurd infrastructure bill, the results are just horrible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=223.96s)]
*  The people have spoken. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump has won Texas, where Cornyn's from, South Dakota, where Thune's from, three times [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  in a row. So it is logical for voters in those states to believe their lawmakers will work [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  with him, not against him, to advance the agenda and certainly not throw monkey wrenches [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=247.24s)]
*  at it. Now, we have an incredible and this really is a once in a generation chance. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=251.96s)]
*  Charlie Kirk was right when he said that last week to make a difference in America and to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  enact policies that the voters have been wanting for years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=261.56s)]
*  We have no time to waste, which is why over the weekend, Trump urged whoever gets the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=267.04s)]
*  leadership role to agree to recess appointments, because sometimes the votes can take [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  two years or more on key cabinet secretaries and other positions, which is what the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=277.04s)]
*  Senate did last go around. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=282.36s)]
*  And Trump added, we cannot let that happen again. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=284.36s)]
*  So John Cornyn is trying to get around the recess appointments by promising to keep [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=288.44000000000005s)]
*  senators in session even over the holidays to get all Trump's people through. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  And those are nice words. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=298.16s)]
*  And maybe that that'll happen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=299.48s)]
*  But Trump does not have the luxury of time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  And even if his agenda is stymied by the usual swampish uniparty maneuvers, the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  Republicans are going to get wiped out in twenty twenty six and maybe in twenty twenty [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=309.56s)]
*  eight if they try to slow the agenda down. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=313.6s)]
*  And what after everything that he's been through, everything that country's been [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=318.0s)]
*  through, what a travesty would be if Trump's historic victory is undermined, not so [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=322.12s)]
*  much by Democrats in resistance, but by his own party. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  How do you think voters would react to that next time they hear in a call or an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=333.48s)]
*  email from the RNC? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=337.88s)]
*  And while we're at it, why are these Senate leadership votes secret anyway? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=340.36s)]
*  Look, if you disagree with President Trump, that's your right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=345.44s)]
*  Disagree with them on whatever it is, deportations or on tariffs on China. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  Why not, though, stand and be heard? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  Others have done that in the past. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=356.12s)]
*  Let's not play hide the ball anymore. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=358.68s)]
*  That's not what we're into. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  We never have been. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=362.28s)]
*  No more killing essential legislation in committee. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=363.88s)]
*  President Trump deserves a fair hearing and a vote on the policies that he [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  campaigned on relentlessly. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  And if senators or congressmen, they take issue with what he's saying, then vote [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=375.4s)]
*  against those measures and then let the voters decide the fate of those [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=379.55999999999995s)]
*  legislators or senators when they're next up for reelection. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  Might be worth remembering Pat Toomey or Jeff Flake or Liz Cheney or Adam [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=388.88s)]
*  Kinziger. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=395.48s)]
*  See it how it worked at all out for them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=397.04s)]
*  We don't elect senators to be part of a club. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=400.36s)]
*  They're supposed to be representing the interests of their states and the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=403.08s)]
*  voters in their states have been very clear. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=406.8s)]
*  They support Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=410.0s)]
*  The other candidate for the Senate majority leader is Florida's Rick Scott, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=412.52s)]
*  who's been a stalwart supporter of President Trump since his first term. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=416.08s)]
*  Scott has also said this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=421.36s)]
*  How do we get Trump's agenda done? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=424.64s)]
*  How do we get his nominees done? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=426.64s)]
*  How do we codify his executive orders? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  That's what's that's what's that's what's up for this leadership race right now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=431.0s)]
*  We have a mandate for change. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=434.68s)]
*  So number one is who is going to represent all the Republican voters? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  Bingo. Of course, he's right on that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  But Punchbowl News is reporting that some senators who don't support Scott are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=445.76s)]
*  annoyed and they feel bullied by the growing online chatter. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=450.24s)]
*  Now, I was talking to my kids about this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=455.44s)]
*  We're driving around the car. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=458.0s)]
*  I said, imagine boys being a U.S. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=458.88s)]
*  senator and feeling put upon by voters mobilizing online. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=461.44s)]
*  I mean, isn't that politics in the modern era? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=468.2s)]
*  That is the town square. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=470.76s)]
*  Now, this all gets more interesting because Elon Musk, who's helping President [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=472.88s)]
*  elect Trump, is supporting Rick Scott. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  At this hour, Scott's online army is mobilizing and flooding Capitol Hill with [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=479.68s)]
*  calls and emails, which, according to Axios, has left some senators livid and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  frustrated with aides warning that it could even cost Scott votes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=489.04s)]
*  Again, the source speaking to Axios is anonymous. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=494.24s)]
*  Typical swamp move. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=499.12s)]
*  But if they're so livid, if they're so frustrated, they need to come on the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=501.64s)]

*  See, the media is like the creep who gets rid of the spouse but then volunteers to lead the search party. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1396.6000000000001s)]
*  Except in this case, it was a disappearance of truth. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1404.72s)]
*  And now they're volunteering to search for it, telling us where to look and actually expecting us to include them, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  even though they're metaphorically covered in blood and Brian Stelter's actually covered in tomato sauce. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1415.0s)]
*  But they're terrified not just of Trump but of losing their influence. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1421.5600000000002s)]
*  So now they're starting to sound like us. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1425.8799999999999s)]
*  Interesting message for Democrats. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1429.28s)]
*  Maureen Dowd's piece for The New York Times entitled Democrats and the case of mistaken identity politics. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1431.84s)]
*  Some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1438.56s)]
*  Democratic insiders thought people would vote for Kamala Harris even if they didn't like her to get rid of Trump. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1444.2s)]
*  But more people ended up voting for Trump, even though many didn't like him because they liked the Democratic Party less. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1450.48s)]
*  Now, remember, that's the same duo who blamed Kamala's loss on racist black and Hispanic men. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  So maybe they finally ran out of people to scapegoat and the only targets left are in the mirror, except they keep breaking those. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1468.1200000000001s)]
*  Listen to Jen Psaki dishing out advice. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1477.0800000000002s)]
*  Look, I happen to believe that Donald Trump is a major threat to our democracy. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1480.48s)]
*  Too many people either didn't buy it and didn't show up or were willing to price in the risk because other issues were more important to them. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1483.8000000000002s)]
*  And the answer to that failure isn't to say fascism doesn't matter. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1491.5600000000002s)]
*  It does. Or to say everyone who didn't vote for Harris is to blame for not hearing or understanding the threat. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1494.8400000000001s)]
*  It's for candidates to rethink how they prioritize what they talk about moving forward. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1500.4s)]
*  It's to rethink how they engage moving forward. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1504.64s)]
*  Do that Joe Rogan podcast, by the way. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1507.52s)]
*  A little late. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1510.04s)]
*  Jen, I'd say quit while you're ahead, but you're so far behind you need to circle back to wipe your own butt. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1512.96s)]
*  Dems all over sounded the alarm on what Trump will do. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1520.88s)]
*  Geraldo suggests Trump could demand a third term. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1525.0s)]
*  Thankfully, he made this prediction while wearing a shirt. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1528.64s)]
*  Don't worry, Geraldo. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  If Trump takes a third term, you'll be too old to know what a president is. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1535.44s)]
*  Many predict Trump will break the law or violate the Constitution. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  Sorry, he's not going to put the view in an internment camp. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1543.96s)]
*  Although they could use the exercise. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1548.28s)]
*  But they assume Republicans would go along with lawbreaking, like using the levers of government to target political opponents. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1550.92s)]
*  In other words, they assume Republicans are just like them, but they're not. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1557.72s)]
*  And it shows that the media and the Dems don't know any actual Republicans. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1561.6000000000001s)]
*  The closest they've come is smelling one of Liz Cheney's farts in the green room. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1565.96s)]
*  For Republicans, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, that comes first. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1569.92s)]
*  If Trump tries to unconstitutionally take away anyone's rights, we'll be first in line to stop it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  We always are. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1581.04s)]
*  After all, isn't Trump's main promise that he's going to actually enforce the damn law, as in have a border, remove criminal gangs, restore order to the cities? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1582.64s)]
*  Show me this great respect for the law that the Dems have. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  Was it during the 2020 Summer of Love when Kamala helped bail out the rioters? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1594.96s)]
*  And Gwen Waltz kept her windows open because she loves the smell of burning firestone radials in the morning. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1599.56s)]
*  What about a president that's incapacitated? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1606.12s)]
*  Isn't a president who keeps falling down supposed to step down? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1610.24s)]
*  This guy was responsible for more spills than a waitress with Tourette's. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1614.6s)]
*  And yet, and yet no 25th Amendment or forced resignation. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1619.68s)]
*  A move, by the way, that prevented the first black woman from becoming president. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1624.52s)]
*  And yet they accuse you of bigotry because you didn't vote for Harris. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1628.76s)]
*  Now, never mind that Trump increased his numbers with blacks, Hispanics and, yes, even suburban white women. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1633.52s)]
*  Turns out Mr. Hitler himself, Mr. Racist, Mr. Misogynist is more about inclusion than the Democrats themselves. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1638.72s)]
*  That must be a real kick in the nuts to this woman. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1646.12s)]
*  And these accusations of racism are coming from people who said nothing when the Democratic Party itself rejected Kamala. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1649.16s)]
*  Kamala's 2020 primary for president made the Hindenburg look like SpaceX. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1656.76s)]
*  But were the racist ones? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1662.44s)]
*  No, fact is Kamala is about as popular with both parties as crabs are at a nudist colony. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1664.4s)]
*  I mean, she had to appear with Liz Cheney so she wouldn't be the least bit of a bitch. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1671.3200000000002s)]
*  But it's so much easier just to call us Nazis. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1676.16s)]
*  It's certainly easier than reporting on a candidate who can't answer a question without cackling like a hyena who's twirling on the wrong end of an electric toothbrush. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  But it was them who didn't want her or they could have had her. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1692.96s)]
*  I mean, she could have been president, but she was not. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1697.24s)]
*  It was them who didn't want her or they could have had her. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1700.4s)]
*  I mean, she could have been president, used the 25th Amendment. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1704.5600000000002s)]
*  That would have been lawful, actually. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1708.24s)]
*  So why didn't they do that? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1710.44s)]
*  Was it racism? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1712.16s)]
*  Was it misogyny? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1713.2s)]
*  Because, you know, they can still do it. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1714.52s)]
*  Joe Biden has been a phenomenal president. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  He's lived up to so many of the promises he's made. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  There's one promise left that he could fulfill being a transitional figure. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1720.88s)]
*  He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris the president of the United States. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1724.1200000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1728.72s)]
*  See, bat-sh-t crazy people can be right. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1729.96s)]
*  If they truly believe Kamala was denied the presidency because of racism and sexism, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1734.44s)]
*  Biden can resign right now and she could be president for two and a half months. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1739.64s)]
*  So what are they waiting for? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1744.0s)]
*  They can make history or herstory. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1745.56s)]
*  So why haven't they done it? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1750.24s)]
*  Who are the Nazis now? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1752.32s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1754.96s)]
*  This Hawaiian has Democrats crying. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1759.44s)]
*  Trump transition team co-chair Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1762.28s)]

*  And she's expectant and needs disinfectant. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1783.76s)]
*  New York Times bestseller, Fox News contributor, Kat Zim. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1787.08s)]
*  Tulsi, I've watched you change and I don't know, I don't think you've changed that much. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1794.8s)]
*  I actually think the world has changed. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1798.8s)]
*  Very much. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  But you, I think you noticed what I'm talking about, that it wasn't necessarily left versus right. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1801.08s)]
*  It was about this larger environment of dishonesty. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1808.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1uIJkY-2fo&t=1812.32s)]
