# Fox News Highlights - April 29th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU)
*  90 minutes of Trump, it's 100 days of action. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=3.4s)]
*  All right, as you saw tonight, Donald Trump's been playing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=7.2s)]
*  offense to make America great again since he first came down [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=9.64s)]
*  that golden escalator. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=12.9s)]
*  And tonight, 100 days in, he's still fighting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=14.5s)]
*  We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=19.16s)]
*  to celebrate the most successful first 100 days [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=22.0s)]
*  of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=25.6s)]
*  And that's according to many, many people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  in history, and everyone is saying it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  We're just — we've just gotten started. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  You haven't even seen anything yet. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  It's all just kicking in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=45.2s)]
*  We're ending the inflation nightmare, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=46.8s)]
*  the worst that we've had probably in the history [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  of our country — getting woke lunacy and transgender [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  insanity the hell out of our government. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=55.3s)]
*  We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  slashing billions and billions of dollars [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=64.6s)]
*  of waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=67.3s)]
*  And above all, we're saving the American dream. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=69.7s)]
*  We're making America great again, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=72.3s)]
*  and it's happening fast, too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=74.1s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 14 weeks [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=79.6s)]
*  is a revolution of common sense. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=82.8s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=85.6s)]
*  A fired-up crowd in Michigan and what Trump billed as [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=87.5s)]
*  something that shouldn't be a revolution, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=91.5s)]
*  but it is in today's Washington — [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=93.5s)]
*  a revolution of common sense. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=95.6s)]
*  You finally have a president who is defending [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=98.0s)]
*  our borders and our nation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=100.2s)]
*  After decades of politicians who destroyed Detroit [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=110.4s)]
*  to build up Beijing, you finally have a champion [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=114.6s)]
*  for workers in the White House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  And instead of putting China first, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=119.5s)]
*  I'm putting Michigan first, and I'm putting America first. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=121.8s)]
*  How great is that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, how many presidents have ever said this, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  except Trump? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=129.0s)]
*  You know, they destroyed Detroit to build up Beijing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  That's just a great one-liner. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=132.9s)]
*  So it's one-liner after one-liner, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  and then a few golden oldies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=136.2s)]
*  After a lifetime of unelected bureaucrats [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=138.6s)]
*  stealing your paychecks, attacking your values, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=141.4s)]
*  and trampling your freedoms, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=144.1s)]
*  we are stopping their gravy train, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=146.1s)]
*  ending their power trip, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  and telling thousands of corrupt, incompetent, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  and unnecessary deep-stake bureaucrats, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=153.4s)]
*  you're fired. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=157.5s)]
*  Get the hell out of here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=158.5s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=161.1s)]
*  He's never going to get tired of saying that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=161.9s)]
*  even if the courts try to prevent him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=163.1s)]
*  But also what was amazing is, earlier in the day, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=165.5s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer was called up by President Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=170.0s)]
*  at a local military base. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=174.2s)]
*  She couldn't have— [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=176.6s)]
*  Yeah, she had to come up and say a few words. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=177.2s)]
*  She didn't want to, clearly, but she was stuck. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, she was without her folder mask. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=181.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=186.7s)]
*  And I have even more good news, if that's possible. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=187.1s)]
*  Liberals see what Trump's done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=189.1s)]
*  They're fuming. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  It's been a hundred days of destruction. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=193.7s)]
*  You think we can survive 550 more? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=195.5s)]
*  This president has already, already, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=197.7s)]
*  only a hundred days in, failed our country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=200.0s)]
*  The first 100 days of the Trump administration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=202.6s)]
*  have been characterized by chaos, cruelty, and corruption. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  Is anyone shocked by this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=213.1s)]
*  Why should you be? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  It's rinse and repeat, sometimes almost word for word, from 2017. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=215.7s)]
*  His first 100 days have been really characterized [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=220.7s)]
*  by chaos, crisis, and confusion. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  We give him failing grades. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=224.7s)]
*  Promise after promise to working people has been broken. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=226.3s)]
*  A hundred days of broken promises to working people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=229.4s)]
*  A hundred days of handouts to the wealthiest people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=233.4s)]
*  These people, they're just simply out of gas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=237.3s)]
*  They're out of ideas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=239.9s)]
*  But look at Trump, his top advisors, his supporters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  Over the past 100 days, they've worked hard and had fun. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Isn't that the pursuit of happiness? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=250.8s)]
*  Fun pushing his agenda. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=252.8s)]
*  Is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  I think your question is so stupid. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=259.4s)]
*  If you are an individual, a foreign national, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=261.2s)]
*  who illegally enters the United States of America, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=263.4s)]
*  you are, by definition, a criminal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=265.9s)]
*  Got this big, beautiful area where employees are supposed to work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=268.3s)]
*  Nobody's here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=272.3s)]
*  It's tough though. We don't have a white brand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=273.3s)]
*  What am I going to do? Leave it letting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=275.4s)]
*  No, there's nothing that progressives hate more. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=278.1s)]
*  And when I say hate, they loathe when conservatives are enjoying themselves. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=281.1s)]
*  So let's tick off liberals by ticking off Trump's early accomplishments. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=288.1s)]
*  Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=292.9s)]
*  We are delivering mass deportation and it's happening very fast. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=299.2s)]
*  The executive orders on the border, Doge, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=305.5s)]
*  the shrinking of the bureaucracy talked about tonight, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=307.8s)]
*  ending DEI, beginning to fix our terrible trade posture, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  opening more areas for energy exploration, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  and then striking a blow against on-campus anti-Semitism. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=318.0s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=322.6s)]
*  He's toppled or exposed at least every left-wing sacred cow [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=324.1s)]
*  and pushed for real changes in failed establishment policy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, of course, this means that the old DC dinosaurs and the rogue resistance, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  they're going to try to stop him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=339.9s)]
*  But Trump's not phased and he's certainly not flinching. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=341.8s)]
*  We cannot allow a handful of communist radical left judges [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=345.5s)]
*  to obstruct the enforcement of our laws [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=348.9s)]
*  and assume the duties that belong solely to the president of the United States. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=351.0s)]
*  Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=356.2s)]
*  to keep our country safe and it's not a good thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=361.0s)]
*  But I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=364.4s)]
*  because we have to do something. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=370.5s)]
*  Well, we'll know soon. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  But on January 20th, let's not forget, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=376.29999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump inherited a country that because of Biden and his policies [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=379.2s)]
*  was on an unsustainable path. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=384.7s)]
*  Biden did incalculable damage. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=387.29999999999995s)]
*  We were overrun with illegals. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=390.5s)]
*  Our military recruitment was way down. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=392.4s)]
*  And we were overcommitted around the world. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=394.3s)]
*  And of course, we didn't have anywhere near the industrial base [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=397.0s)]
*  to support those commitments. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=400.1s)]
*  So when Biden shuffled out of town, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=402.5s)]
*  I dare say we were closer to becoming a superpower in name only. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=405.5s)]
*  So Trump knew that if we continue down this path, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=411.0s)]
*  we'd seal our fate as a paper tiger. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=414.0s)]
*  So he moved fast tackling more of the big issues at any one time [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=416.7s)]
*  than any president in recent memory. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=421.2s)]
*  Trump understands that first and foremost, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=424.5s)]
*  America must be in a position to fulfill the most basic promises to our own people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=427.5s)]
*  Decent jobs, good schools, safe cities. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=434.3s)]
*  Those all seemed increasingly out of reach over the last four years. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=437.8s)]
*  And now the $36 trillion debt bomb ballooning interest payments, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=442.2s)]
*  Trump knows our financial survival is at risk. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=445.6s)]
*  But Biden's strategy, frankly, the entire Democrat Party strategy, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  was to borrow, spend and print more money. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=453.0s)]
*  It was classic Washington. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=456.6s)]
*  So at this hundred day mark, the media, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  they're trying to paint Trump like the tariff man is like the Grinch who's stealing Christmas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=461.1s)]
*  How silly. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  The New York Times is a big piece today. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  There are no toys at Christmas time. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=469.5s)]
*  Well, were there toys before 2000 when China joined the WTO? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=473.1s)]
*  I had toys under my tree. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=477.70000000000005s)]
*  The real Grinches are the politicians who year after year kept America on a trajectory of denial and decline. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=479.9s)]
*  They got us into stupid wars. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=488.4s)]
*  They blew trillions of dollars. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=489.9s)]
*  They allowed the cartels and open door to kill our kids with fentanyl. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=491.5s)]
*  And they allowed our factories to close. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  They created massive trade deficits. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  And as Trump said tonight, that essentially funded the Chinese military expansion [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=500.29999999999995s)]
*  that now threatens the entire globe. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=506.0s)]
*  Those are the Grinches. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  But Trump is the only president with the guts who's tried to solve the problems that four prior presidents created with Congress. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=511.7s)]
*  And never forget his most vocal critics. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=520.9s)]
*  They just go along with whatever makes the Beltway establishment happy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=524.0s)]
*  And while that was good for the lobbyists, they got really rich, good for the lawyers, ditto. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=527.0s)]
*  It was horrid for the working people of states like Michigan across the old Rust Belt. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  The more blowback Trump gets in this period of time, the more I think he's on the right path. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  A lot of you wonder, you know, why do Trump supporters, a lot of liberals especially, say, why are they so loyal to him? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=546.6s)]
*  Why do they remain so committed to him? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  Simple answer. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=554.7s)]
*  You saw it tonight. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=556.0s)]
*  Because they know that he's loyal to them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=557.7s)]
*  So despite all the pressure to sell him out, they know he's doing this, everything he's doing for the right reasons. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=561.7s)]
*  And it's not to be popular with the Council on Foreign Relations or the China lobby or the hedge funders or the teachers unions. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=568.9000000000001s)]
*  In the end, they'll all still be rich. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=576.2s)]
*  They'll be fine. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=578.9000000000001s)]
*  But America will be stronger, our manufacturing more robust, our military more lethal, and our people healthier. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=579.5s)]
*  Now that's a superpower with superpowers. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=587.7s)]
*  So I can't wait for the next hundred days. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=591.0999999999999s)]
*  Nasty angle. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump celebrating the first hundred days of his second term in Detroit, Michigan. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=595.5s)]
*  He just left the stage moments ago. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  We just had the biggest victory in Michigan. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=602.9s)]
*  They said, sir, it's going to be hard. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=605.8s)]
*  Well, we won it twice. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=607.4s)]
*  We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=609.0999999999999s)]
*  That's according to many, many people. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=620.2s)]
*  This is the best, they say, 100 day start of any president in history. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  And everyone is saying it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=629.1s)]
*  We just we've just gotten started. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  You haven't even seen anything yet. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=633.4000000000001s)]
*  It's all just kicking in. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=635.2s)]
*  Trump says he's having fun running the world and you can just see it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=637.1s)]
*  How are you? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=643.0s)]
*  How's your day? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=644.3000000000001s)]
*  If there was one big thing you didn't want to have the first hundred days, what would it be? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=645.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're either we've done everything or it's in the process of being done. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=652.2s)]
*  He said he wouldn't trade places with anyone in the world. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=658.2s)]
*  Well, except maybe one. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=660.9s)]
*  As Pope? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=667.2s)]
*  I'd like to be Pope. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=668.8s)]
*  That would be my number one choice. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=670.7s)]
*  Before his big speech in Detroit, Trump stopped by a military base in Michigan to celebrate with the troops and he didn't come empty-handed. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=672.8s)]
*  Today, I've come in person to lay to rest any doubts about Selfridge's future and the vital role it'll play in our national defense. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=680.6999999999999s)]
*  As commander in chief, I'm proud to announce that very soon we will replace the retiring A-10 Warthogs with 21 brand new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=690.4s)]
*  The best in the world, fresh off the line. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=702.3s)]
*  Nothing says happy hundred days like new fighter jets. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=708.8s)]
*  And there was one special guest in the room who was ready to party and she was from the other party, Big Gretch. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=711.9s)]
*  I want to thank Governor Gretchen Whitmer for bringing it also to our attention very strongly. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=719.0999999999999s)]
*  And you know, I'm not supposed to do that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=725.0s)]
*  She's a Democrat. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=726.5s)]
*  They say don't do that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=727.5s)]
*  Don't have her here. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=728.5999999999999s)]
*  I said, no, she's going to be here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=729.4s)]
*  She's done a very good job, frankly. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=730.7s)]
*  So I want to thank you very much Gretchen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=733.5s)]
*  Good job. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=735.2s)]
*  Well, I hadn't planned to speak, but I'm on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=737.0s)]
*  I am really damn happy we're here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=752.1s)]
*  I'm so so grateful that this announcement was made today and I appreciate all the work. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=752.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  Good for Gretchen. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=758.3s)]
*  She didn't hide her face behind the folder like last time. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=759.3s)]
*  Trump 2.0 is different. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=762.5s)]
*  Bill Maher's breaking bread. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=764.5s)]
*  Morning Joe did a pilgrimage. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=766.5s)]
*  Saquon's golfing and Big Gretch cured her TDS. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=768.5s)]
*  Even the Washington Post gives him credit. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=772.5s)]
*  Quote, since FDR's earth-shaking first hundred days in office, no president has matched the sheer drama and disruption of this 15 week sprint, at least until now. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=774.5s)]
*  In a hundred days, we've seen $160 billion doged, useless agencies shuttered, DEI terminated, inflations down, but nothing's more down than border crossings. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=785.7s)]
*  Down 99.9%. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=797.7s)]
*  Which is your favorite? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=799.7s)]
*  Out of the last hundred days, what is the number one thing that you think President Trump and his team have done? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=801.7s)]
*  Secured that border. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=807.7s)]
*  Our border. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=809.7s)]
*  The border, the border. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=811.7s)]
*  Immigration law, baby. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=813.7s)]
*  After complaining about the bad ombre mugshots on the White House lawn, MSNBC is being forced into the field to talk to people. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=814.9000000000001s)]
*  And the people say Trump's killing it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=822.9000000000001s)]
*  I am totally excited. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=824.9000000000001s)]
*  Everybody I know is excited. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=826.9000000000001s)]
*  My biggest issue is at the border. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  And he's killing it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=830.9000000000001s)]
*  Well absolutely everybody that's here illegally should go. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=832.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not one of these that, oh, the poor person. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=834.9000000000001s)]
*  No, they need to go. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=836.9000000000001s)]
*  There's so much action on illegal immigration, Democrats can't deny it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=838.9000000000001s)]
*  Here's Stephen A. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=843.1s)]
*  The fact that Trump rolled up in there and cleaned this stuff up, prioritizing border control definitely is going to be perceived as a plus whether Democrats and others like it or not. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=845.1s)]
*  Border patrol has been outstanding. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=857.1s)]
*  The economy, the nation's other top priority, still unfinished business. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=859.1s)]
*  On the plus side, American industry is making a comeback. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=863.1s)]
*  We're taking back our country from a sick political crisis. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=867.1s)]
*  We're taking back our country from a sick political class that got rich selling America out and bleeding America dry. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  After decades of politicians who destroyed Detroit to build up Beijing, you finally have a champion for workers in the White House. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  And instead of putting China first, I'm putting Michigan first and I'm putting America first. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=887.3000000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing jobs are back and $5 trillion private money is being used to build a new country. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  And of course, private money is being invested in American steel, energy, tech, pharma, autos and AI. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=899.5s)]
*  But the market took a little bit of a hit on the trade war. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=905.5s)]
*  The president said we had to take our medicine and wait for the tax and regulation cuts to get on track this summer. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=909.5s)]
*  Hopefully that'll steady the ship. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=915.5s)]
*  The president's confident that it will. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=917.5s)]
*  The media are panicking. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=919.5s)]
*  It's officially been a hundred days of Donald Trump. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=923.5s)]
*  I'm so tired. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=929.5s)]
*  It's aging this nation in Tom Hanks' castaway years. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=934.5s)]
*  Tonight we're kicking off the week long coverage of Donald Trump's first 100... [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=939.5s)]
*  Let's call them days. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=950.5s)]
*  Overseas, the Panama Canal has been secured. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=952.5s)]
*  The Houthi rebels are under fire and Greenland's on the menu. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=955.5s)]
*  The Ukraine war is still raging and Trump's growing a little frustrated with Putin. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=958.7s)]
*  So the next hundred days are all about deals. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=962.7s)]
*  I think what we've really done here is deals. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=966.7s)]
*  So we've worked on deals. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=970.7s)]
*  There's a peace deal, there's a trade deal, there's a tax deal. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=972.7s)]
*  And the first hundred days has set the table. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=976.7s)]
*  And I think the next hundred days we're going to see the fruition of all those. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=978.7s)]
*  Insiders say Trump's in his disruption phase right now. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=983.7s)]
*  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=987.9000000000001s)]
*  I believe he has from now to about January 1st to be very disruptive. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=989.9000000000001s)]
*  After that, Trump needs to be stabilizing, pulling together and explaining. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=994.9000000000001s)]
*  Voters say it's not that scary compared to the last four years. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=999.9000000000001s)]
*  Are you prepared to pay higher prices for goods? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1004.9000000000001s)]
*  I've been paying higher prices, sweetie, in the last year. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1007.9000000000001s)]
*  When Biden got in office, my groceries had doubled, my gas had doubled. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1010.9000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm all the use to it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1015.9000000000001s)]
*  No one said it would be easy. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1017.9000000000001s)]
*  Trump's taking on issues that his predecessors never tackled [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1019.9000000000001s)]
*  and let fester. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1022.9000000000001s)]
*  Trade, border, war. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1023.9000000000001s)]
*  Trump's not running for reelection, we think. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1025.9s)]
*  So this isn't about politics. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1029.9s)]
*  It's about putting America in a strong position to thrive in the 21st century. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1031.9s)]
*  You said, quote, hang tough. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1036.9s)]
*  It won't be easy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1039.9s)]
*  You said that to the American people. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1041.9s)]
*  Is that what Americans should expect? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1042.9s)]
*  Some hard times? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1043.9s)]
*  I've said that during my campaign. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1044.9s)]
*  We won a campaign by a lot. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  We won all seven swing states. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  We won the popular vote by a lot. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1051.1000000000001s)]
*  You said you're going to have a transition period. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  We've been ripped off by every country all over the world. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1055.1000000000001s)]
*  They're laughing at us. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1058.1000000000001s)]
*  They thought we were stupid people, and we were. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1059.1000000000001s)]
*  And I said, that's not going to happen. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1061.1000000000001s)]
*  But hard times? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1063.1000000000001s)]
*  Hard times are ahead? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1065.1000000000001s)]
*  I think great times are ahead. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  Look, since I came in, gasoline is down, groceries are down, egg prices are down. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1068.1000000000001s)]
*  The American people voted for complete upheaval in Washington. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1074.3s)]
*  And if anything, Trump delivered that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1077.3s)]
*  Sometimes you have to demolish a building before rebuilding it into a skyscraper. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1080.3s)]
*  How fast and how effective Trump can rebuild what he's demolished will determine his legacy. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1085.3s)]
*  But Democrats, if they take back power in two years, they won't let them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1091.3s)]
*  They just filed articles of impeachment. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1095.3s)]
*  Some guy that I'd never heard of. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1098.3s)]
*  John James, is he a congressman, this guy? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1101.3s)]
*  He said, he said, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1103.5s)]
*  What the hell did I do? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1111.5s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1112.5s)]
*  They want to impeach me. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1113.5s)]
*  This is lunatic. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1114.5s)]
*  Actually, I had the television way down and I said to our great first lady, listen, did [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1117.5s)]
*  I just hear I was being impeached again? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1122.3s)]
*  We're getting good at this, though. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1125.6s)]
*  And then you have the other one that's always with the cane. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1126.8999999999999s)]
*  He's always impeaching. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1129.1s)]
*  He raises his cane. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1130.7s)]
*  So far, Trump's support from Republicans rock solid. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1132.6s)]
*  His voters are along for the ride and they're loving it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1136.6s)]
*  I think the first hundred days has been a breath of fresh air. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1139.6s)]
*  I think that everybody's been waiting for change no matter what party you are. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1142.8s)]
*  I feel that the change is undeniable. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1146.8s)]
*  And so this is the first hundred days. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1150.6999999999998s)]
*  I can't wait to see what the first thousand days. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1152.8s)]
*  A hundred days of history is in the books, a hundred days of political shock and awe, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1155.8s)]
*  and President Trump fulfilling his campaign promises, implementing the Make America Great [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1161.0s)]
*  Again agenda at a record pace, all while battling the Washington, D.C. establishment, the institutionalists, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1166.2s)]
*  better known as the swamp, the legacy media mob at the same time, pathetic Democrats, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1173.8999999999999s)]
*  that party every step of the way. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1179.3s)]
*  And tonight, the president was in Michigan for a massive rally commemorating the start [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  of what he's calling a new golden age for America and for all Americans. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1186.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1190.3s)]
*  We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1191.3s)]
*  one hundred days of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1196.8s)]
*  And week by week we're ending illegal immigration. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1201.8s)]
*  We're taking back our jobs and protecting our great American auto workers and all of [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1206.8s)]
*  our workers, frankly. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1213.2s)]
*  We're ending the inflation nightmare, the worst that we've had probably in the history [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1214.2s)]
*  of our country, getting woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1219.0s)]
*  We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1226.0s)]
*  of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1234.0s)]
*  And above all, we're saving the American dream. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1237.2s)]
*  We're making America great again and it's happening fast, too. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1239.8000000000002s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 14 weeks is a revolution of common sense. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1243.6999999999998s)]
*  That's all it is really. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1249.1999999999998s)]
*  We're conservative. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1250.1999999999998s)]
*  You're conservative, you're liberal, whatever the hell. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1251.1999999999998s)]
*  You know what it's all about? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1254.6999999999998s)]
*  It's about common sense. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1255.6999999999998s)]
*  When you think about it, we're for common sense. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1256.6999999999998s)]
*  We've set all time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1264.5s)]
*  Ever recorded. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1265.5s)]
*  I'm proud to be the president for the workers and not the outsources. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1266.5s)]
*  I'm the president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1271.2s)]
*  Our golden age has only just begun. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1274.7s)]
*  We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1277.7s)]
*  We will never give in. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1282.4s)]
*  We will never give up. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1283.5s)]

*  We will never, ever surrender. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  We will fight, fight, fight and we will win, win, win. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1289.5s)]
*  Alright, let's be clear. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1294.5s)]
*  We can spend all night doing something the state-run legacy media mob would never do [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1295.9s)]
*  and that's list the actual accomplishments from Donald Trump's first hundred days. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1300.5s)]
*  The president said it best. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1304.6000000000001s)]
*  If Democrats had their way, America, as we know it, would be over. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1305.8000000000002s)]
*  We'd be a third world hellhole, open borders. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1310.0s)]
*  That means more terrorists, more gang members, murderers, rapists, cartel members and probably [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1313.0s)]
*  all likely on a path to citizenship. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1318.4s)]
*  America would decline into default and bankruptcy and since the Trump-hating legacy media mob [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  will never bring you facts, we're going to highlight the sheer difference between Democrats [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1326.3s)]

*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1335.1000000000001s)]
*  In just this short period of time, the president slashed a record number of regulations. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1336.3s)]
*  He's making his middle class tax cuts permanent. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1341.4s)]
*  He declared a national energy emergency. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1344.3s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on social security, no tax on overtime. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1346.8s)]
*  By the way, that includes offshore drilling on the energy issue, drilling in the Gulf [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1351.7s)]
*  of America, where just this week the administration celebrated the first production from a major [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1356.1s)]
*  new venture just off the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1361.8s)]
*  President Trump has also pulled the United States from the job-killing, cost-ineffective, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1366.1999999999998s)]
*  idiotic Paris Accords. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1371.5s)]
*  He ended Biden's liquefied natural gas export ban. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1373.3s)]
*  Now the cost of energy is down significantly. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1376.6999999999998s)]
*  The cost of gas is down. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1379.6s)]
*  Mortgage rates are going down. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1381.1s)]
*  And to top it all off, Doge, that's right. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1383.0s)]
*  Those horrible people, they have already saved you, the American taxpayer, over $160 billion [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1385.5s)]
*  in waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption, and they are still counting. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1393.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, 26 American hostages have been brought home. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1396.5s)]
*  The hooty rebels are getting pounded. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1399.8s)]
*  Iran is getting squeezed financially. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1401.9s)]
*  And they better make a deal or they will regret it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1404.5s)]
*  Peace between Russia and Ukraine is finally, at least it's within reach. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1408.2s)]
*  And for once, a real possibility. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1413.3s)]
*  Not a single U.S. service member has been killed overseas. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1415.9s)]
*  And, by the way, Donald Trump is finally holding China accountable while negotiating better [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1419.3s)]
*  trade deals with every country in the world, while getting the U.S. out of the corrupt [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1424.1000000000001s)]
*  World Health Organization and slashing USAID. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1428.7s)]
*  We could go on and on, and we still haven't even mentioned the border. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1432.6000000000001s)]
*  Probably this greatest success in 100 days. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1436.0s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1439.1999999999998s)]
*  In less than 100 days, Donald Trump made good on his biggest campaign promise. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1440.1999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden, well, said it couldn't be done. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1445.1999999999998s)]
*  He needed legislation. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1447.8999999999999s)]
*  He was wrong, as usual. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1449.3999999999999s)]
*  Under Trump, the border is not just secure, it is the most secure border in American history. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  Take a look at these numbers from the DHS. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  Daily border encounters are down a whopping 93 percent. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1459.8s)]
*  Encounters with gotaways down 95 percent. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1463.5s)]
*  The migrant crossings are down 99 percent. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1466.6s)]
*  We went from 160,000 ICE encounters per month under Biden to around 7,000 under Trump, with [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1470.1999999999998s)]
*  almost zero released into the country. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1477.6999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile, the deportation numbers continue to grow. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1480.1999999999998s)]
*  And according to ICE, they have deported over 65,000 illegal aliens in Trump's first 100 days. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1483.6s)]
*  They've arrested another 66,000 illegals, most of which have criminal charges or convictions, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1490.3s)]
*  including nearly 500 for murder, 1,300 for sex offenses, and 2,300 gang members. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1496.5s)]
*  These dangerous offenders were roaming around your country thanks to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1503.9s)]
*  and Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1509.4s)]
*  And now they're getting deported thanks to President Trump. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1511.4s)]
*  As the president said, it's about promises made and promises kept. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1514.3s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, President Trump is doing all of this amid nonstop, unrelenting negative [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1518.2s)]
*  coverage from a corrupt, broken, state-run legacy media mob. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1525.1s)]
*  Take a look at this study. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1530.1s)]
*  Media Research Center. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1531.3s)]
*  Despite everything that Donald Trump has done, their coverage is still a whopping 92 percent negative. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1532.6999999999998s)]
*  Only 7.8 percent positive in his first 100 days. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1540.3s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on this petty behavior from the left. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1543.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1555.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1565.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1569.8999999999999s)]
*  That means some of you will live. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1571.1s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1573.8999999999999s)]
*  So Kamala Harris is speaking in San Francisco tomorrow, and she's charging $25 for anyone [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1575.3999999999999s)]
*  who wants to livestream it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1580.8999999999999s)]
*  And if you don't have $25, she'll also accept alternate forms of payment. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1583.3000000000002s)]
*  So why is it, why is this being livestreamed? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1592.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1595.4s)]
*  Well, it's to allow women to watch from home instead of leaving their husbands alone with the help. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1596.7s)]
*  President Trump said he's bringing back Columbus Day after Joe Biden renamed the holiday [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1604.4s)]
*  Indigenous Peoples Day, and surprise, one Native American leader now claims she's part Italian. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1608.8s)]
*  Oh, now they laugh. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1618.6s)]
*  Actor Terrence Howard says he turned down the role of singer Marvin Gaye because he couldn't kiss a man. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1621.3s)]
*  It's the same reason he won't play Barack Obama. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1627.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, former first lady Michelle Obama says Trump's deportation policy keeps her up at night. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1629.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1641.6s)]
*  You'd be worried, too, if your husband's from Kenya. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1643.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  JB Pritzker is now calling for mass protests and disruption, vowing that Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, now we'll know how his toilet feels. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1658.6s)]
*  A psychiatrist is willing to testify that Sean Diddy Combs did not have the mental capacity to commit crimes. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1663.8s)]
*  The psychiatrist will do this by pointing to his music. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1670.8s)]
*  Finally, the tennis world is up in arms after a new rule stipulates that chaperones must watch players shower after matches [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1677.8999999999999s)]
*  to make sure they don't evade drug tests. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1686.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, guess who was applied for the job as chaperone? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1689.2s)]
*  So today marks Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1699.2s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1706.2s)]
*  But in reality, 100 is an arbitrary number, kind of like the age of consent for Hunter Biden. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1709.2s)]
*  Or Kamala's blood alcohol content. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1715.4s)]
*  But with Trump, 100 feels like a thousand. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1718.4s)]
*  So many moves, and many are big. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1720.4s)]
*  This March saw the lowest monthly number of border encounters on record. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1722.4s)]
*  Violent illegals who roam the streets under Biden are being removed at record speed. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1726.4s)]
*  Only nine illegals have been discharged into the country. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1731.4s)]
*  But they were released into the audience for Fox & Friends and quickly self-deported. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1736.4s)]
*  Trump downsized federal government with doughs, saving $160 billion in the process. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1742.4s)]
*  It's far from enough. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1748.4s)]
*  But at this rate, $1.6 billion a day, we might avoid economic ruin. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1749.4s)]
*  He crushed DEI, took men out of women's sports, returned plastic straws to our waiting mouths, unleashed domestic energy production, and made showers great again. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1753.4s)]
*  Not that some Democrats actually use them. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1765.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1769.4s)]
*  But when Trump says he'll do something, he does it at breakneck speed. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1770.4s)]
*  How do you explain this? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1774.4s)]
*  Well, all Trump did is match the pace of politics to the accelerating change of technology. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1775.4s)]
*  And Trump 2.0 is changing the speed of politics. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1781.4s)]
*  So much so, it's like replacing a carrier pigeon with a 5G iPhone. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1784.4s)]
*  Or replacing Jesse Watters with someone who had their GED. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1790.4s)]
*  So as policies move faster than a pruned Danish through Joe Biden's digestive tract, other things will take time, like tariffs. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1793.4s)]
*  But where's the media's hysterics now that the stock markets return to near normal in mere days? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1804.4s)]
*  I get it, because while Trump's rolling, Dems are polling at record lows, coming in just above poison ivy and just below anal fissures. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1810.4s)]
*  So they resort to aping the past with no solutions for the future. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1819.4s)]
*  On Sunday, Dem leaders sat on the Capitol steps spewing verbal diarrhea for 12 hours. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1822.4s)]
*  They were so sad, even pigeons would eat on them. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1828.4s)]
*  Cory Booker emphasized the moral urgency. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1833.4s)]
*  Well, if it's so urgent, Cory, why are you the one killing the most time? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1836.4s)]
*  I've seen homeless guys get more aggressive than the rest of the world. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1841.4s)]
*  On one hand, he tells us the sky's falling. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1844.4s)]
*  On the other, he's seeing how long he can go without being. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1845.4s)]
*  But today, Dems are too impaired by anger and self-driven theatrics to see clearly. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1849.4s)]
*  They're chasing the romance of resistance, embracing losing issues like the Marilyn dad. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1854.4s)]
*  As if Ward Cleaver also punched June in the face. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1860.4s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1865.4s)]
*  No wonder the corrupt media, our neutral observers, have hit Trump with a 92% negative coverage. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1866.4s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1872.4s)]
*  Well, Trump's revealed the true battle. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1874.4s)]
*  It's between the ins and the outs, the self-obsessed versus the selfless. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1876.4s)]
*  Every morning, Trump wakes up to life as an adventure. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1881.4s)]
*  What can I do today? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1884.4s)]
*  What dragon can I see? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1885.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1887.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1889.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1890.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1891.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1892.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1893.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a dragon. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1894.4s)]
*  What dragon can I slay? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1895.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the aging Dems still cling to identity politics. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1897.4s)]
*  They become consumed by the self and left the world behind. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1900.4s)]
*  Trump, however, has no time for who he is. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1904.4s)]
*  It's what he does that matters. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1906.4s)]
*  He's productive, not resentful. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1908.4s)]
*  The future is his. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1910.4s)]
*  The past is dead. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1911.4s)]
*  Modern leftism is the reverse. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1913.4s)]
*  It no longer seeks meaning in the outside world. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1915.4s)]
*  It's now who you are, not what you do, which leads to nothing but disaster. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1918.4s)]
*  The world is at the border, crime, biology. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1923.4s)]
*  The obsession with self replaced the pursuit of solutions. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1926.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the solution to the Dems' problem is right in front of them. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1929.4s)]
*  It's Trump. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1933.4s)]
*  He's showing you the way forward, and it is forward. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1934.4s)]
*  You need to stop looking backward, obsessing over past depressions while mimicking dead radicals. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1938.4s)]
*  You need to look up and out. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1943.4s)]
*  There's a world out there that dwarfs whatever you think your pronoun is. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1945.4s)]
*  Right now, the Dems are looking backward and inward. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1949.4s)]
*  No future, no adventure, just the past and the sad self. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1952.4s)]
*  So today serves as a moment of reflection. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1956.4s)]
*  100 days can be a transformative period, but only if you're tired of living in the past and living in your own head. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=1959.4s)]

*  I'd like to scrub you clean. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2016.4s)]
*  How would you grade, I hate this whole concept of the 100 days, it just feels like a media creation, but we have to talk about it. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2018.4s)]
*  What's your grade? How's the economy? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2026.4s)]
*  The economy is great. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2029.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2030.4s)]
*  Here's the most amazing thing. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2031.4s)]
*  This is the most, there's never been a fear campaign to this degree ever. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2033.4s)]
*  The stats blow me away. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2037.4s)]
*  There have been more negative stories about Trump than COVID. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2039.4s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2042.4s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2043.4s)]
*  The media has scared the hell out of people. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2044.4s)]
*  Just a couple hours ago, Visa reported earnings and said consumers are doing great. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2047.4s)]
*  They're not the only company that said that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2051.4s)]
*  On Wall Street, there's a thing called soft data and hard data. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2053.4s)]
*  The soft data is all the surveys when you scare the hell out of people. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2056.4s)]
*  And it's so funny, like, you know, terror's gonna destroy you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2059.4s)]
*  What are you worried about right now? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2062.4s)]
*  Terrorists? Oh, wow. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2064.4s)]
*  That made them feign like, oh, look at the public. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2066.4s)]
*  It is really absolutely amazing. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2068.4s)]
*  I was shocked when you said 8% have positive stories. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2070.4s)]
*  Like, who are these people? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2074.4s)]
*  Because they're probably going to be fired. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2076.4s)]
*  There's nothing he can do that will give positive coverage. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2077.4s)]
*  But I'm telling you right now, I think they're setting themselves up for big trap. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2080.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2084.4s)]
*  The stock market, all the things that they feign to care about these days, because before the stock market never mattered. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2085.4s)]
*  It was just for rich folks. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2090.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2091.4s)]
*  I was like, oh, it's hurting. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2092.4s)]
*  I've had friends who called me up. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2093.4s)]
*  I know they're not in the damn stock market. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2094.4s)]
*  Stop bullshitting me. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2096.4s)]
*  Like, hey, Charlie, what's your boy doing with the market? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2097.4s)]
*  I said, why do you care? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2099.4s)]
*  I'm down. Get the fuck out. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2100.4s)]
*  I know you 30 years. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2101.4s)]
*  You never asked me about the market once. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2103.4s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2105.4s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2107.4s)]
*  Jim, I fulfilled your dream. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2109.4s)]
*  I sandwiched you between two large black men. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2112.4s)]
*  What you do with that dream is entirely up to you. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2115.4s)]
*  I'm going to say wake up. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2122.4s)]
*  And then I'm going to say run. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2125.4s)]
*  Well, this could just as easily be your dream, Charles. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2128.4s)]
*  Between me and Wenger. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2131.4s)]
*  So Jim. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2133.4s)]
*  When I was on drugs. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2138.4s)]
*  So Jim, 100 days, you're an astute political observer. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2140.4s)]
*  Is this unlike any first 100 days ever? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2144.4s)]
*  Well, except for the length of time. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2147.4s)]
*  It is interesting to watch. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2150.4s)]
*  Like, I like certain things he's done. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2152.4s)]
*  Certain things I don't like. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2154.4s)]
*  But I like Doge. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2155.4s)]
*  Like, I like that they say it comes to like $1,000 per person. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2156.4s)]
*  Or as I call it, two and a half escorts. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2160.4s)]
*  Per person. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2162.4s)]
*  I like Doge. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2163.4s)]
*  I like a lot of the stuff. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2164.4s)]
*  I like that he's kicking out people who don't belong here [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2165.4s)]
*  because they're not here legally. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2168.4s)]
*  But I don't like certain things. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2169.4s)]
*  Like, I don't like the birthright citizenship thing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2170.4s)]
*  I don't think you can't, you know, whether you like it or not. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2173.4s)]
*  It's the 14th Amendment. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2176.4s)]
*  And I also don't like that Maryland guy, who I do think belongs [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2178.4s)]
*  out of the country, they still have to bring him back and do it right [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2181.4s)]
*  and then kick him out. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2184.4s)]
*  Because immigration demands you do paperwork and everything 100%. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2186.4s)]
*  Didn't they do that though? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2189.4s)]
*  There was a couple of, I mean, I think you and I are probably going to agree. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2190.4s)]
*  It's an administrative process, not really a legal one. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2193.4s)]
*  And I'm sure he was before two judges. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2197.4s)]
*  What more do you want? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2199.4s)]
*  They both said they have to bring him back though. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2200.4s)]
*  Like, the federal court and I think the Supreme Court both said, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2202.4s)]
*  and Trump has to be careful, you can't start bucking courts [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2205.4s)]
*  because they understand, liberal courts and conservative courts [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2208.4s)]
*  have more in common than conservative courts do with him. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2211.4s)]
*  It's like two divorce lawyers. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2214.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2215.4s)]
*  The husband and the wife's lawyers connect with each other [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2216.4s)]
*  a lot more than they connect with the husband and the wife. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2218.4s)]
*  That is so interesting. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2220.4s)]
*  So I think that he should be careful with that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2221.4s)]
*  and just get the guy out of the country, but do it by the book. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2223.4s)]
*  I think they should bring him back, but make it two trips. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2226.4s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2233.4s)]
*  By the way, I'm... [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2235.4s)]
*  That, that... [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2236.4s)]
*  He doesn't want to play Barack Obama jokes. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2237.4s)]
*  I'm going to laugh about that for two weeks. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2240.4s)]
*  God, that was a good joke. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2242.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2244.4s)]
*  Emily, Emily, Emily, do you think it helps? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2245.4s)]
*  Well, here's a question. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2248.4s)]
*  Have the Democrats done anything in 100 days? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2249.4s)]
*  I can't think of anything other than wine and sing horribly. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2251.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2255.4s)]
*  The 100 days to the Democrats is like a complete fiction [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2256.4s)]
*  of the rest of our 100 days. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2261.4s)]
*  So let's take the example that you just talked about [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2263.4s)]
*  where you talked about an administrative error [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2265.4s)]
*  that needs to sort of correct someone's process, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2267.4s)]
*  and I assume you are meaning due process. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2270.4s)]
*  But this person was someone who was already deported [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2273.4s)]
*  and then came back against... [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2275.4s)]
*  Against... [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2277.4s)]
*  He was a recidivist, a legal enterer in the country. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2278.4s)]
*  And what I don't understand is this sort of wiping the slate clean [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2281.4s)]
*  that the Dems do when they are blurring out the signs on the White House [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2284.4s)]
*  and levying this guy, you know, lifting him up as the Maryland father. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2288.4s)]
*  I don't quite understand why. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2291.4s)]
*  It's as if their memory has only started from like two seconds in, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2293.4s)]
*  so the conversation is just administrative. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2296.4s)]
*  But the point was that this guy was a wife-beating, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2298.4s)]
*  violent, gang-affiliated asshole [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2300.4s)]
*  that kept coming into our country multiple times. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2302.4s)]
*  It should have stopped then. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2304.4s)]
*  But here's the point about the 100 days. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2306.4s)]
*  So we know that there is 92% illegal or negative coverage of the president. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2308.4s)]
*  100% negative coverage, by the way, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2312.4s)]
*  of some of his other people in the administration, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2314.4s)]
*  like the Secretary of Defense. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2318.4s)]
*  What is that? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2320.4s)]
*  But if you dig into that, it was the lion's share of coverage was about Trump. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2322.4s)]
*  So only a small portion was Biden, mostly positive. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2325.4s)]
*  Vast majority all Trump, totally negative. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2328.4s)]
*  But here are the stats that matter. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2331.4s)]
*  96% of Trump voters are glad they did. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2333.4s)]
*  They know it was the right thing to do. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2336.4s)]
*  86% know that his economic policies will make us stronger. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2338.4s)]
*  Half of those say, yep, it's going to be a little rocky. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2341.4s)]
*  The rocky part we went through. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2343.4s)]
*  But we know it's going to make us stronger. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2345.4s)]
*  So the media to the left, hair on fire, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2347.4s)]
*  their 100 days is everything is blowing up. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2349.4s)]
*  We tried constitutional crisis. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2351.4s)]
*  We tried everything. Now we're going to try impeachment. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2353.4s)]
*  Since the law fair didn't work, since illegal voting didn't work. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2355.4s)]
*  That's where they are now. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2358.4s)]
*  But the rest of the Americans are glad they are on this ship [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2360.4s)]
*  that has finally been righted, thanks to President Trump. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2362.4s)]
*  Mm. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2365.4s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2367.4s)]
*  Tynus, finish us off, and in a completely innocent way. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2370.4s)]
*  Yes, I assume so. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2374.4s)]
*  The sandwich didn't really work out. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2376.4s)]
*  So we're going to... Listen, desperate times demand desperate measures. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2379.4s)]
*  And I agree that the Maryland father should get his day in court. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2385.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, we had the doors of our country written off [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2394.4s)]
*  and the doors of our country ripped wide open, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2398.4s)]
*  and some of the world's worst villains and perpetrators are walking amongst us. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2400.4s)]
*  So I think we arrest as many as we can. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2404.4s)]
*  We kick them out. We move them out of the country. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2407.4s)]
*  And just like we do here, we'll give them a piece of paper with a court date on it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2410.4s)]
*  And once they're all where they need to be, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2415.4s)]
*  they'll have their little paper with their court date, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2418.4s)]
*  and in 10 to 12 decades, we'll bring you back... [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2421.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2425.4s)]
*  ...and we'll give them their paper with their court date, just like they do... [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2427.4s)]
*  When they're here. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2429.4s)]
*  So, yes. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2431.4s)]
*  Why are you... Why do you come up with this? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2433.4s)]
*  No, it's a great idea. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2435.4s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2437.4s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2439.4s)]
*  So we just mirror what they said. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2441.4s)]
*  Democrats, you have a great idea. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2443.4s)]
*  We're going to round them all up. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2445.4s)]
*  Well, El Salvador is a willing, tax-free participant. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2447.4s)]
*  Behold said individuals. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2451.4s)]
*  We will give them their paperwork [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2453.4s)]
*  and give them their court date. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2455.4s)]
*  It's going to be in... [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2457.4s)]
*  And we'll get you there as soon as you... [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2459.4s)]
*  Exactly what happens when they come here, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2461.4s)]
*  and you're doing it back to them. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2463.4s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2465.4s)]
*  I'm going to... [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2467.4s)]
*  I'm going to steal that for my next book. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2469.4s)]
*  I was wondering, Dave, getting a little... [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2473.4s)]
*  You know, that's the up here, the books, man. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2475.4s)]
*  You're a little overdue. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2477.4s)]
*  All right, Charles, enough out of you. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2479.4s)]
*  All right, up next, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2481.4s)]
*  the football star gets pumped. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlfk9A9ryU&t=2483.4s)]
