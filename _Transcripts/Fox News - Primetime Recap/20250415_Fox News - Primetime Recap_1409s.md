# Fox News Highlights - April 14th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE)
*  Left on the edge. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, while everyone's wondering how low the market could go, the angle's wondering [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=3.6s)]
*  how low can the Democrats go? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  There is a sickness on the left. It's a mind virus that seems to be getting worse. One [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  where killers and other criminals become deities. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=19.06s)]
*  As long as criminals target what the liberals despise, they'll be treated with empathy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=23.32s)]
*  and understanding, even reverence. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=28.28s)]
*  This is the United States of America. As if we don't lionize criminals. As if we don't [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=31.32s)]
*  have, you know, we don't stan murderers of all sorts. We give them Netflix shows. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=35.8s)]
*  Attention shippies like Taylor Lorenz even brag about how cool they are for standing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=41.96s)]
*  up for the man charged with murdering a well-known health insurance CEO. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=46.84s)]
*  I saw the biggest audience growth that I've ever seen because people were like, oh, somebody, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=51.56s)]
*  young journalist is actually speaking to the anger that we feel. You're going to see [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=58.08s)]
*  women especially that feel like, oh my God, right? Like here's this man who, who's revolutionary, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=61.92s)]
*  who's famous, who's handsome, who's young, who's smart. He's a person that seems like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=67.88s)]
*  this morally good man, which is hard to find. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is really funny. Funny for Brian Thompson's wife and children, you think? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=80.76s)]
*  Now there's nothing funny about how unhinged and how psychotic the far left has become. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=87.44s)]
*  Women and men fetishizing over a killer like he's some new Abercrombie model. And again, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  it's good for a few chuckles. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=101.12s)]
*  Let's begin with the story. Everyone is still talking about the arrest of Luigi Mangione, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=104.2s)]
*  alleged CEO killer and the reason conjugal visit is trending on Google. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=109.24s)]
*  Our TV personalities stoking more killer worship. Of course they are. Maybe that's not their [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=114.72s)]
*  intention, but they are. They normalize the crime when they downplay it for some cheap [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=119.96s)]
*  applause line. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=124.92s)]
*  This is confusing as a straight man to me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do to attract [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=126.28s)]
*  women. One day it's do more work around the house. The next it's be a better listener. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=131.32s)]
*  And now apparently it's execute the leader of a fortune 500 company. Which one is it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=136.44s)]
*  ladies? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=141.44s)]
*  Of course we all know that line wouldn't have made late night if the victim had let's say [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=142.68s)]
*  been the head of a left wing NGO heaven forbid. But legitimizing murder never acceptable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=148.1s)]
*  But I'm sure there are plenty of disappointed fringe leftists out there today after learning [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=156.04s)]
*  that another would be Trump assassin is in custody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=160.8s)]
*  In February, the bodies of Tatiana Kassop and Donald Mayer were found in their home [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=165.2s)]
*  in the village of Waukesha. Both had been shot. Their son, 17 year old Nikita Kassop [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=169.32s)]
*  was later arrested in Kansas. Now a federal search warrant says Kassop wrote a manifesto [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=174.96s)]
*  calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump to start a revolution to quote [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=180.62s)]
*  save the white race. The warrant says Kassop talked about his plans with other people who [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=185.5s)]
*  encouraged him and helped him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=191.24s)]
*  Look, at least we know more about him than we do about Thomas Crooks and the vicious [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=193.92s)]
*  hyperbole of our political leaders. It's clearly making things worse. Every politician knows [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=200.88s)]
*  what when he or she uses words like Hitler or Nazi to describe someone. There's a risk [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=207.56s)]
*  that someone will hear those words and decide to take matters into their own hands. After [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  Butler and the foiled plot at Trump International, he'd think that everyone would take it down [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=222.12s)]
*  a notch. But they didn't. After dining out on January 6th for four years, Democrats have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=228.36s)]
*  spawned the rage generation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=235.76s)]
*  Tell me what democracy looks like. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=252.12s)]
*  Ho ho! Elon Musk has got to go. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=257.12s)]
*  The irony is lost on them, of course. The cars they drove as a badge of honor just a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=261.72s)]
*  year ago, they're now torching and scratching, or laughing and enjoying the moments when [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=266.12s)]
*  others are. 40 year old Jameson Wagner was arrested for arson attacks on Tesla and Albuquerque [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=273.44s)]
*  and also on the Republican Party headquarters there. The guy's less than a zero, but to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=280.52s)]
*  the Trump and Elon haters, he's kind of a folk hero. There are some Democrats who do [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=285.44s)]
*  seem clued in, however, especially when the violence and the crime hits close to home, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  as it did over Passover when Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence was broken [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=297.32s)]
*  into and set ablaze, allegedly by this freak, Cody Bomber, who said he would have taken [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  a hammer to the governor if he could have. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=307.96s)]
*  This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society. And I don't give a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=310.76s)]
*  damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=316.08s)]
*  or another or one particular person or another. It is not OK. And it has to stop. We have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=324.76s)]
*  to be better than this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=334.0s)]
*  100 percent correct. This is appalling. President Trump was asked about it today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=335.36s)]
*  Have you distributed a motive through the FBI investigation behind the attack on Governor [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=343.36s)]
*  Josh Shapiro over the weekend? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  No, I haven't. But the attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand, just from what [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=350.36s)]
*  I read and from what I've been told. The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody. It's probably [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=356.24s)]
*  just a whack job. And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=362.24s)]
*  Thankfully, Shapiro and his wife were OK. But now it's time for his party to step up [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=367.24s)]
*  and with one voice, all of them, in unison, condemn all the hate and the violence. Supreme [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=373.6s)]
*  Court justices shouldn't have to worry about their security when they author an opinion. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  A senator shouldn't have to worry when he's at a restaurant. A congressman shouldn't have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=387.2s)]
*  to fear playing a baseball game. And a presidential candidate should never have to be ushered [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=393.24s)]
*  off stage with blood streaming down his cheek. And of course his supporters shouldn't have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  to wonder if they're risking their lives to attend a rally. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  So Democrats, tell your party to debate. Don't destroy. Heaven forbid if one of these deranged [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=411.0s)]
*  fanatics finally get their way. And yes, there are obviously nuts on both sides and heated [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=417.96s)]
*  rhetoric has been around since our founding. But Republicans do not equivocate when Democrats [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=424.52s)]
*  are threatened. We rally. Remember, for Christians, this is Holy Week. It's a time to reflect [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=430.6s)]
*  on Christ's life and teaching his suffering and of course the great miracle of his resurrection [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=436.6s)]
*  and our redemption. And we all, whatever you believe, we have the God-given right to life, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=442.6s)]
*  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. What a blessing. So let's start acting like it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=448.04s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=454.56s)]
*  How did you enjoy the fight? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=455.56s)]
*  I thought it was great. I thought they were all great. Have you ever seen that before? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=456.56s)]
*  Have you ever witnessed that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=462.16s)]
*  No, it was the first time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=463.16s)]
*  First time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=464.16s)]
*  Something, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=465.16s)]
*  First time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=466.72s)]
*  Those are seriously tough people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=467.72s)]
*  Did any of the fighters say anything to you? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=468.72s)]
*  Yeah, they all said, they all, every one of them came up at the end and they were great. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=471.24s)]
*  I mean, they're all warriors, you know, modern day warriors. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=476.24s)]
*  What did you tell them? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=479.92s)]
*  Just good fight. I mean, the ones, they all came up. Every one of them. You saw that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=482.92s)]
*  And very respectful of the office. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=486.92s)]
*  Trump took a bullet and said, fight, fight, fight. You know what he's about. Afterwards, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=490.44000000000005s)]
*  he got on Air Force One and had his granddaughter, Kai, meet his favorite opponent. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=494.8s)]
*  You know the fake news? This is the fake news. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=498.8s)]
*  Hey, what's up, everyone? How are you guys? Good morning. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=503.8s)]
*  The fake news turned the Oval Office into the octagon today. And you won't believe who [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  they were fighting for. Remember the MS-13 gangbanger that the media calls a Maryland [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=511.92s)]
*  dad? Well, he got deported and now CNN wants him back. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=517.16s)]
*  You said that if the Supreme Court said someone needed to be returned, that you would abide [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=522.28s)]
*  by that. You said that on Air Force One just a few days ago. And they said that it must [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=525.52s)]
*  be facilitated. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=529.72s)]
*  Why don't you just say, isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=530.72s)]
*  Why can't you just say that? Why do you go over and over and that's why nobody watches [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  you anymore? You know, you have no credibility. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  Yep. The press is fighting to have gangbangers smuggled back into the country. And if they're [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  not smuggled back in, they're calling it a constitutional crisis. Mr. Kilmore Garcia, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=548.28s)]
*  who broke into the country under Barack Obama, was arrested in 2019 in the company of other [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=553.76s)]
*  ranking MS-13 gang members. Homeland Security called him a verified member of MS-13. And [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=559.36s)]
*  two immigration judges upheld that he was MS-13. A judge thought Garcia was so dangerous, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  he denied him bond and called him a flight risk. The reason he wasn't deported earlier [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=573.42s)]

*  Trump designates MS-13 a terrorist organization, and we're not just going to let foreign terrorist [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  gangbangers hang around, so we ship them home. So the MS-13 lawyer, Suze, and this little [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=594.3s)]
*  district judge, Boasberg, says he wasn't supposed to be sent back to El Salvador. He can be [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=601.02s)]

*  You are all asking a lot of questions about this, and you also have to care about it a [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=803.46s)]

*  here tell me what would happen to the illegal alien from El Salvador if he came back to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=811.22s)]

*  if he came back here? Does any of you know? Any of you? You've been writing? I'm talking [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=824.86s)]
*  now. You need to stop. I'm talking now. Does any of you? You're done. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=829.3399999999999s)]

*  So a judge could fill out some paperwork and send him right back to El Salvador? Or do [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=841.02s)]
*  they want to fly the terrorist back here and just have him hang around in Maryland? The [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=845.26s)]
*  president of El Salvador couldn't believe how the media was asking about returning a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  terrorist instead of how Trump secured the border. Why are those numbers not in the media? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=854.02s)]
*  Well, they get out with the fake news. You know, like CNN, CNN over here doesn't want to put [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=859.78s)]
*  them out because they don't like, they don't like putting out good numbers. They only like [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=864.74s)]
*  putting out because I think they hate our country actually. When CNN went back on the air, here's [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=868.18s)]
*  what they said. I just want to say for the record, since we heard President Trump say in the Oval [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=872.98s)]
*  Office that CNN hates our country, CNN does not hate our country. That should go without saying. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=880.02s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't go without saying. Maybe a lot of people on that work don't hate America, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=888.5s)]
*  but they definitely don't love it. Everything they're doing runs against making America great. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=894.26s)]
*  Well, it was never great. So I'm not going to say the again part, but making America great. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=900.1s)]
*  Here's a breaking news. We live in a racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic country. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=902.98s)]
*  When we got our freedom, our quote unquote freedom, we were never restored whole, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=909.3s)]
*  which is why you hear about reparations. So until the United States atones for that and makes good [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=913.14s)]
*  on that, we're still living in a racist country. If America is so bad, why are millions of foreigners [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=917.54s)]
*  breaking into it? Trump's supporting so many foreign criminals that AOC is running out of friends. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=922.66s)]
*  We must acknowledge the terrifying moment that we are in right now. And that what we are hearing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=929.2199999999999s)]
*  and seeing with our own eyes is in fact happening. We are watching our neighbors, students, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=935.94s)]
*  and friends being fired, targeted, and disappeared. It is real. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=944.5s)]

*  a pipe dream. Take a look. I don't understand the rationale for the tariffs. Perhaps it's to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1225.62s)]
*  bring back American manufacturing, but I really think that's a pipe dream and not something that [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1233.4599999999998s)]
*  is likely to be accomplished. And we could even raise questions about whether or not in a broad [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1242.58s)]
*  based way, that's a desirable goal. The rationale, how about stop ripping off America, stop abusing [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1248.98s)]
*  America, especially our allied countries, most of whom depend on the U S for their national security. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1256.5800000000002s)]
*  Other big news today. Tech giant, Nvidia announced a $500 billion investment right here in the USA [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1263.8600000000001s)]
*  entirely manufacturing their super computers, AI infrastructure inside this country for the very [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1271.7800000000002s)]
*  first time. But according to ABC's John Karl, another elitist in the media, this type of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1278.34s)]
*  investment is not actually a good thing. Apparently he's worried that we will become quote a nation of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1284.4199999999998s)]
*  cobblers. Take a look. The president also said there's going to be a transition cost transition [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1291.3s)]
*  problems. I mean, we are going to see higher prices in America as well. There's like, you can [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1297.3799999999999s)]
*  open a factory tomorrow to build iPhones or to make sneakers, shoes. I mean, we buy a lot of [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1302.18s)]
*  shoes in this country. 99% of them are made elsewhere. I mean, are we going to become a [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1311.0600000000002s)]
*  nation of cobblers again? I mean, this is going to mean higher prices, isn't it? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1318.18s)]
*  I mean, have you seen, I don't necessarily think so. I think the idea is that we can [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1324.5800000000002s)]
*  manufacture here in America. All right. As a former blue collar worker for decades in my life, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1330.74s)]
*  I kind of take it as a compliment, but this isn't just about good American jobs. It's also a matter [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1337.7s)]
*  of national security, you know, relying on China for pharmaceuticals or other countries for [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1343.46s)]
*  semiconductor chips. That's a dangerous game. And right on cue, China just suspended exports of rare [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1349.94s)]
*  earth minerals to the U S in a blatant attempt to kneecap weapons and tech manufacturing. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1356.58s)]
*  So Donald Trump is absolutely right. This reliance on China and other countries will come to an end [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1362.34s)]
*  once and for all. They can have free and fair trade if they choose or reciprocal tariffs. That's [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1369.22s)]
*  their choice. The president will almost never get any positive coverage from the legacy media mob. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1374.58s)]
*  The good news is almost no one in the U S trusts or respects these people anyway. So what's the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1380.18s)]
*  point? It doesn't really matter what they say or what they write anyplace, anywhere. Anyway, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1386.74s)]
*  these far left Democrats pretending to be newsmen are screaming into the void. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um494XgIaIE&t=1393.54s)]
