# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 14, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY)
*  The Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Columbus Day, everybody. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, this is a day that commemorates the discoveries [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=4.36s)]
*  and daring spirit of Christopher Columbus. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=6.86s)]
*  Now, it's a figure that is revered especially [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=10.0s)]
*  by Italian Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=13.24s)]
*  But of course, as they do with every American tradition, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=15.24s)]
*  the left and Kamala Harris want to destroy this day [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=17.82s)]
*  and shame all of us for celebrating. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=21.32s)]
*  Remember this, Jim. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  It is an honor, of course, to be with you this week [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=26.26s)]
*  as we celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=29.44s)]
*  as we speak truth about our nation's history. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=32.940000000000005s)]
*  Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=36.86s)]
*  for tribal nations, perpetrating violence, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=40.86s)]
*  stealing land, and spreading disease. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  We must not shy away from this shameful past. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=48.6s)]
*  Well, of course, Trump, he's sticking with Chris. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=53.3s)]
*  His memory stands as an enduring testament [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=57.3s)]
*  to the daring spirit that built our great civilization. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  And as long as I have anything to say about this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=64.38s)]
*  and I hope that's going to be a long time, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=67.14s)]
*  it will always be Columbus Day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=69.48s)]
*  And that is a perfect encapsulation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  of where we are as a nation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  and the choice that's before us in 22 days. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=79.08s)]
*  So, which way is it, America? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=83.06s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=85.22s)]
*  All right, over the weekend, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=90.12s)]
*  the Elon Musk's team of aerospace engineers and physicists [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=91.26s)]
*  managed to pull off two high-risk, dramatic feats. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=94.84s)]
*  First, SpaceX launched a massive super-heavy starship rocket, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=98.7s)]
*  which in and of itself was incredible to watch. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=102.7s)]
*  But what happened after was truly mind-blowing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=106.84s)]
*  Now, the first stage of the rocket [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=110.28s)]
*  landed back on the launch pad [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=111.72s)]
*  with the help of a gargantuan mechanical arm [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  and a cool pincer-type move. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=118.72s)]
*  We have successfully putt the super-heavy booster [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=130.56s)]
*  back at the launch tower. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  What an incredible! [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=137.7s)]
*  Literally, the tower caught the rocket, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=140.6s)]
*  as Elon Musk tweeted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=143.66s)]
*  And then the other objective perfectly achieved [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  was the spectacular belly-flop splashdown [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  right on target in the Indian Ocean Sunday morning [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=152.14s)]
*  after the successful test flight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=155.04s)]
*  Starship is on target. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Approaching landing burn startup. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=159.14s)]
*  Landing burn startup. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=161.04s)]
*  You can still feel the reflection of that landing burn. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=168.48s)]
*  You can see the water just behind the ship. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=172.52s)]
*  Starship is on target. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=183.02s)]
*  And in front of you, I think it is safe to say [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=186.36s)]
*  we have a ship in the water. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=189.26s)]
*  Touchdown! [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=193.44s)]
*  I don't know if it was like this for you, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=194.84s)]
*  but I could not get enough of this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=196.84s)]
*  It was absolutely awe-inspiring. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=198.84s)]
*  That was after Musk unveiled his RoboTaxi prototype [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=202.0s)]
*  and his plans for a new Tesla robot last Thursday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=206.56s)]
*  It can be a teacher, babysit your kids, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  it can walk your dog, mow your lawn, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  get the groceries, just be your friend, serve drinks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=225.64s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk's success in innovation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=228.6s)]
*  would not have been possible in a socialist country, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=231.6s)]
*  but it's possible here, at least for now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=235.16s)]
*  But in states like California, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=238.64s)]
*  this type of spectacular risk-taking and investment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=240.14s)]
*  is becoming increasingly more difficult. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=243.44s)]
*  Now, we all know that Elon Musk already announced [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=246.64s)]
*  his move of X and SpaceX from the Golden State [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=248.88s)]
*  where both companies were founded. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=252.27999999999997s)]
*  But the corporate exodus from California [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  has been going on for years, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=256.72s)]
*  as other states like Texas, Tennessee, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=258.8s)]
*  Florida, South Dakota, the list goes on, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=261.92s)]
*  have been over backwards [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  to create much friendlier business climates. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=265.74s)]
*  At its best, our capitalist system encourages risk-taking [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=269.44s)]
*  and rewards smart innovation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=273.1s)]
*  It doesn't punish success with burdensome regulations [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=274.76s)]
*  or a crushing tax regime. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  Now check out the top states for doing business [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=281.28s)]
*  in 2024 by one survey. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=283.7s)]
*  So what do nine out of 10 of them have in common? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=286.24s)]
*  Republican governors. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=291.84s)]
*  But Harris and the Democrats, they have other priorities [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=294.4s)]
*  beyond just growing an economy or innovation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=298.04s)]
*  Well, they have climate change, of course, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=300.86s)]
*  that's their religion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=302.44s)]
*  And then they want to wokeify everything we do, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=303.68s)]
*  everywhere we do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=307.68s)]
*  And when you need to get rockets up in the air [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=310.04s)]
*  and cars on the road that are self-driving, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=311.88s)]
*  the last thing you should be thinking about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=314.0s)]
*  is racial or ethnic quotas in hiring. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=316.26s)]
*  You should never be thinking about that anyway. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=318.04s)]
*  Hiring the best and most talented people is Musk's hallmark. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=320.12s)]
*  Now as the most innovative force in America today, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=325.32s)]
*  it is fitting that Musk is working hard [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=327.8s)]
*  to get Trump re-elected. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=330.08s)]
*  He knows that to be a country where greatness [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=331.94s)]
*  can still happen, where the American dream is still possible, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=334.6s)]
*  we have to protect our sacred rights. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=338.1s)]
*  We have to respect our constitution. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=341.3s)]
*  And yes, our traditions matter. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=343.54s)]
*  We need to give our people a reason to celebrate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=346.26000000000005s)]
*  the American spirit as millions did over the weekend, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=348.62s)]
*  watching these incredible advances in space travel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=351.82000000000005s)]
*  Now, of course, liberals are used to having [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  all the billionaires on their side. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=357.98s)]
*  So they've been on a tear against Musk [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=359.5s)]
*  since he spent, what, $44 billion to buy Twitter [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  and restore free speech to the platform. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=364.62s)]
*  And with his endorsement of Trump, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=367.38s)]
*  now they treat the man who is really the Thomas Edison [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=369.18s)]
*  of our age just like they treat Trump, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=372.28s)]
*  like a dictator in waiting. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=375.26s)]
*  You are electing Elon Musk if you are also electing Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  You're getting the richest guy in the world [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=380.26s)]
*  who controls a major social media platform. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=382.02s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=385.7s)]
*  What a blowhard. Dangerous, Donnie. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=387.3s)]
*  Well, none of these people seem to think it's dangerous [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=390.52s)]
*  when major forces on Wall Street and Silicon Valley [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=392.94s)]
*  own Kamala Harris. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=396.24s)]
*  A few weeks ago, she hauled in a staggering $27 million [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=398.24s)]
*  at a soiree in Manhattan, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=401.56s)]
*  attended by big money from hedge funders [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  and investment bankers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=405.68s)]
*  Now, even the New York Times today had to concede [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=407.68s)]
*  that big business is pulling her strings. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=410.48s)]
*  Now, here's the reality of the situation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=414.04s)]
*  Harris is controlled by the people [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=416.44s)]
*  who want to maintain the status quo. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=419.08s)]
*  And look, she and they want things to say. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=422.56s)]
*  The same, just as they are. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=426.1s)]
*  Remember, they all think Obama did a great job. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=428.18s)]
*  They think Joe Biden did a great job. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=430.42s)]
*  They think Dick Cheney did a great job. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=432.5s)]
*  That's why the Old Guard globalists are all supporting her. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, we've been governed by this bipartisan oligarchy [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  for most of the past 25 years or so. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=442.3s)]
*  We've spent trillions on wars we did not win. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=445.22s)]
*  We've lost tens of thousands [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=448.62s)]
*  of our American patriots along the way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  We've lost millions of jobs to outsourcing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=453.34s)]
*  But if you think it worked out well for the working class, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=457.14s)]
*  definitely Kamala's your gal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=460.14s)]
*  But most voters, and you look at the surveys, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  they're staggering. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=465.73999999999995s)]
*  They think the economy stinks. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=466.9s)]
*  Inflation has been crushing to American families, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=469.17999999999995s)]
*  a 25 to 30% hit on most of them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  It is nightmarish economically [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=476.84s)]
*  compared to where most of our citizens were pre-pandemic [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=478.78s)]
*  when Donald Trump was in charge. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=482.22s)]
*  And it's hugely stressful for parents [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=484.22s)]
*  and single people alike. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=486.78000000000003s)]
*  But if you believe that we can do better, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=489.06s)]
*  that our country can do better, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=491.3s)]
*  that we can have higher wages for the middle class [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=493.42s)]
*  and a higher standard of living for Americans, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=495.54s)]
*  then you're gonna support Trump [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=497.86s)]
*  and you'll ignore the incessant propaganda [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=499.82000000000005s)]
*  from now until November 5th. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=502.18s)]
*  And it is heating up. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=503.74s)]
*  We'll get into that a little bit later on. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=504.70000000000005s)]
*  Now, remember when they said [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  that Trump was gonna start all those wars, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=508.74s)]
*  when he'd crash the economy, you know, 2015, 2016? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=511.1s)]
*  Well, of course he did the opposite. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=514.82s)]
*  Back then, just as now, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=517.16s)]
*  they're trying to scare you all away [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=519.34s)]
*  from embracing a more America-focused [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=521.02s)]
*  economic and foreign policy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  But historians are gonna judge this campaign, I think, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=526.26s)]
*  100 years from now, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=528.74s)]
*  as an inflection point in American history. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=530.14s)]
*  If Trump is re-elected, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=533.1800000000001s)]
*  this will be seen as a time [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=534.94s)]
*  when Americans took their country back, again, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=536.62s)]
*  from the incompetent, bloated, corrupt forces [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=539.58s)]
*  that have run us into the ground for decades [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=542.72s)]
*  and that they returned it and turned us to a period [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=545.6600000000001s)]
*  when we still believed we were a noble nation [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=548.94s)]
*  with an amazing history, not perfect, but still amazing, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=551.38s)]
*  and that we can still do great things. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=554.72s)]
*  Musk believes that with his whole heart. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  Trump and Vance obviously believe that, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=560.86s)]
*  which is why they're running. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=563.22s)]
*  But the question is, do enough voters believe it? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=565.62s)]
*  Or have they gotten so beaten down, so beaten up, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=569.62s)]
*  and so intimidated that they've given up? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  From the national pride and amazement about SpaceX [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=579.0200000000001s)]
*  and the enthusiasm and the patriotism and love [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=582.5400000000001s)]
*  that you're seeing at all these Trump rallies, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=586.62s)]
*  including in California over the weekend, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=588.38s)]
*  I'm betting that enough Americans still believe [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=591.34s)]
*  the best is yet to come. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=593.98s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=596.1400000000001s)]
*  Democrats haven't felt this badly [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  since Biden bombed the debate. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=599.02s)]
*  The party is leaking like crazy. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=600.86s)]
*  Anxiety, despair is the mood in Washington. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=603.34s)]
*  The Harris campaign is stuck in the mud. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  And behind the scenes, Democrats are worried she's stalled [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=609.62s)]
*  and her so-called lead has evaporated. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=613.62s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris had a five-point lead [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=617.1s)]
*  in our last poll taken a month ago, right after the debate. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=619.74s)]
*  That lead has all but evaporated, Willie. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=623.22s)]
*  Take a look at this new head-to-head matchup, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=626.3s)]
*  48% to 48%. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=629.04s)]
*  That is what we call a deadlocked race. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  At this point in the election, Hillary was up seven, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  Biden was up nine. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=638.56s)]
*  The betting markets of Trump's chance of winning [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=640.3599999999999s)]
*  is better than 50-50, and the battlegrounds are all tied up. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=642.54s)]
*  So if the polls are as wrong as they usually are, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=647.8s)]
*  we could know the winner on election night. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=650.0999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are jittery. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=652.86s)]
*  Trump's numbers are historic. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  In the bottom line is this, at this particular hour, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=657.9s)]
*  if you believe the polling, Donald Trump's gonna put up [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=660.12s)]
*  the best performance with black voters [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=662.52s)]
*  since Richard Nixon back in 1960, not 68 since 1960. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=664.28s)]
*  That's 64 years ago. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=668.26s)]
*  Among Hispanic voters, Donald Trump's gonna put up [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=669.7s)]
*  the best performance for Republicans [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=671.6s)]
*  since 2004 in George W. Bush. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=673.4s)]
*  The media's preparing for the worst. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=675.62s)]
*  They're wargaming a Trump sweep. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=677.62s)]
*  Newsweek is even throwing around the L word. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=680.64s)]
*  Mm-hmm, landslide. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=683.54s)]
*  Three weeks until election day, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=685.74s)]
*  and it's already started, the panicked phone calls. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=687.34s)]
*  In certain Wilmington and greater concern [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=692.86s)]
*  amongst Democratic elected officials, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=695.5s)]
*  who I hear from daily asking me what I know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=697.74s)]
*  because they know I know some stuff, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=700.5s)]
*  and telling me explicitly and through their questions, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=702.26s)]
*  they are worried, okay? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=705.98s)]
*  Doesn't mean she won't win, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=708.12s)]
*  but that's how we head into the weekend, okay? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=709.62s)]
*  Democrats are worried about where things stand. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=711.9s)]
*  Democrat insiders are growing worried [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=714.98s)]
*  that the euphoria over Harris's entry into the race [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=716.74s)]
*  hasn't translated. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  They say she hasn't given voters enough reason to vote for, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=721.7s)]
*  and she's feeling the pressure. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=726.22s)]
*  Barack sent her on a media blitz, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  and she said she was no different than Biden. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=730.26s)]
*  And now the Harris campaign is changing strategies again. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=733.14s)]
*  After snubbing the Fox debate, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=737.1s)]
*  now Kamala's gonna be sitting down [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=739.28s)]
*  with Bret Baer this Wednesday. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=740.9s)]
*  All week, Kamala's gonna be playing defense. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=743.74s)]
*  She'll be campaigning only in Pennsylvania, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=746.5s)]
*  Wisconsin, and Michigan. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=749.18s)]
*  Her map is shrinking, but she claims she has faith. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=751.28s)]
*  It is easy in these moments of crisis to question our faith, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=756.28s)]
*  to sometimes lose our faith for a moment, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=761.02s)]
*  because what we see is so hard to see [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=763.98s)]
*  that we lose faith or a vision of those things [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=767.7s)]
*  we cannot see but must know. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=770.58s)]
*  I don't know what she just said. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=772.7800000000001s)]
*  So after calling on the Messiah [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  to scold wavering black men, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=775.98s)]
*  Democrats are letting loose the comeback kid. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=777.98s)]
*  But there's one problem. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  Nobody recognizes them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=783.0200000000001s)]
*  Hi. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=785.5s)]
*  Oh! [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=788.34s)]
*  You too? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=790.7s)]
*  Oh, you got a vacuum! [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=795.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=797.02s)]
*  All white guys look alike, I know. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=805.02s)]
*  And after Bill Clinton got shortchanged at McDonald's, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=808.26s)]
*  he sabotaged her campaign at a rally. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=811.62s)]
*  We'll have more on that later. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=813.8199999999999s)]
*  But Democrats think someone else [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=815.66s)]
*  is sabotaging her campaign. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=817.42s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=819.9s)]
*  Insiders believe that Biden still holds resentment [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=821.46s)]
*  over how he was forced out, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=824.68s)]
*  and he wants to remind people who's the boss. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, just on Friday, he told Harris to hush up. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=830.06s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  well, we're gonna have to, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=839.98s)]
*  I know I'm gonna go to the vice president in a second. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=841.9s)]
*  The, she's my boss here. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=844.74s)]
*  That's a true piece of. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=847.2199999999999s)]
*  We're gonna be, hang out in a second, man, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=851.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=855.62s)]
*  10 sources, 10, tell Axios that the relationship [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  between Kamala's campaign and the White House [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=861.1s)]
*  has been increasingly fraught and awkward. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=863.46s)]
*  Senior Biden aides are still wounded by the coup. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=866.5s)]
*  NBC says Biden personally was stung [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=870.5s)]
*  when Harris used the I'm not Joe Biden line at the debate. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=873.66s)]
*  Now Harris insiders say they need to grow up. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=877.02s)]
*  They're too much in their feelings. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=880.16s)]
*  But they hate that Biden keeps big footing them. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  One person in the middle of it says, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=885.18s)]
*  the White House is lacking someone in the room [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  thinking first and foremost about how things [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=889.28s)]
*  would affect the campaign. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, Biden might wanna let Kamala know [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=894.52s)]
*  that Israel is gonna bomb Iran at any minute. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=896.52s)]
*  Just a heads up, Madam Vice President, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=899.22s)]
*  don't want this to be a surprise. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=901.92s)]
*  And Harris's handlers are pressuring her [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=904.6s)]
*  to throw Joe under the bus [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=906.92s)]
*  and do whatever she needs to do to win. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=908.96s)]
*  But Kamala can't do it [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=911.72s)]
*  because she's been a machine politician her whole life. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=913.72s)]
*  And she's only gotten ahead by kissing up to the party boss. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  Even though she's kind of the party boss herself now, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  she knows she didn't earn it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=924.2s)]
*  So she can't act like a boss. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=925.8000000000001s)]
*  And she's scared of blasting Biden, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=928.2s)]
*  even if it helps her win, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=930.62s)]
*  because no one Fs with the Biden. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  Any Democrat who's gone against Joe didn't last long. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  Look at Gold bar Bob, look at Eric Adams. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=938.84s)]
*  So the longer she stays loyal, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=942.2s)]
*  the more likely it is she'll lose. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=944.5s)]
*  And if she throws him under the bus, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=947.22s)]
*  then Joe goes after her to no win. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=950.1600000000001s)]
*  Name something that you keep in your glove compartment. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=953.12s)]
*  Oh, DP Harris. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=955.84s)]
*  Steve, look, I was raised in a middle-class family. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=962.88s)]
*  Okay, my mother raised my sister and me, all right? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=963.72s)]
*  She worked hard and saved up. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=967.12s)]
*  Yeah, uh-huh. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  And we had a second mother too. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=970.4s)]
*  Okay, did that mother have a glove compartment? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=972.0s)]
*  A small business owner named Miss Shelton. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=975.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, we got that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=977.8s)]
*  Something that you keep in your glove compartment. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=978.76s)]
*  Oh, a Glock, Steve, a big old Glock. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=981.68s)]
*  So they know it's a sinking ship [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=985.4s)]
*  and the media has been given the green light to ridicule her [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=986.92s)]
*  and they keep going, watch. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=990.64s)]
*  Payne has raised a billion dollars. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=992.32s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=994.96s)]
*  How are you not winning by a landslide? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=996.68s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=998.8s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1000.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a question I scream into my pillow every morning. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1002.2199999999999s)]
*  Kamala raised a billion dollars in three months [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  and she's still the underdog. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1009.62s)]
*  If Trump had that money, he could win California. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  But as everybody knows, money can't buy you love. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1015.54s)]
*  The candidate is still Kamala Harris. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1019.16s)]
*  Douglas McKinnon in the Hill says, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1022.52s)]
*  Democrats have come to the realization [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1024.12s)]
*  that Harris is simply not a very good candidate. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1026.4399999999998s)]
*  She lacks confidence and is seemingly terrified [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1029.32s)]
*  to take any unrehearsed or unvetted policy questions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  Harris is also a member of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1036.56s)]
*  An administration so bad [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  that the party wouldn't let the president run for reelection [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1043.08s)]
*  because it'd be a guaranteed wipeout. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  And now the party's fighting with each other [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  because they nominated a far left San Francisco politician [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1052.04s)]
*  out of step with regular Americans. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1055.44s)]
*  Binder is back to fighting with Kirby [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  over who controls the briefing room. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1060.88s)]
*  Harris is fighting with Joe. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1063.2s)]
*  Barack's fighting with the blacks. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1065.52s)]
*  Harris is even fighting with her own super PAC. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  When Democrats are fighting with each other, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1071.24s)]
*  they're not fighting Trump [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1073.64s)]
*  and they're definitely not fighting for you. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1075.44s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are only 22 days away [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1078.48s)]
*  from the election. The panic on the left is palpable. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1081.48s)]
*  The poll numbers are not good for Kamala Harris. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1085.0s)]
*  However, I urge every voter to assume [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1087.48s)]
*  that your sole vote will decide this election. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1090.92s)]
*  In other words, take nothing for granted. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1094.0s)]
*  But now in a last-ditch effort to win over voters, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1096.48s)]
*  the Harris campaign, this is getting very interesting. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1099.12s)]
*  They are trying out two very desperate measures. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1102.08s)]
*  One, the first includes more public events [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1105.36s)]
*  for the Democratic candidate [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1108.12s)]
*  who's been in hiding for 84 days. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1109.36s)]
*  And as you can imagine, it is not going well at all. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1111.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1114.8s)]
*  You know, there's this whole, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1116.04s)]
*  I talked with somebody once who said, you know, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1117.36s)]
*  if you just look at where the stars are in the sky, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1119.3999999999999s)]
*  don't look at them as just random things. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  If you just look at them as points, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1127.52s)]
*  look at the constellation, what does it show you? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1129.28s)]
*  So you just outlined it, Roland. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1132.32s)]
*  What does it show you? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1134.24s)]
*  That the cities that he picks on [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1136.6s)]
*  in terms of black population or black mayor are both. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1140.12s)]
*  Stars in the sky, beautiful. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's state the obvious. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1148.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a terrible candidate. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1149.56s)]
*  Her running mate, well, it's just as bad if not worse. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1151.48s)]
*  She does not connect with voters, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1154.56s)]
*  especially without a teleprompter. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1156.56s)]
*  That is why Kamala has been in hiding. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1158.36s)]
*  That is why her surrogates [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1161.1599999999999s)]
*  are so important to her campaign. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1163.48s)]
*  Now, this brings us to the second desperate measure [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1166.0s)]
*  that the Harris campaign is now employing here. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1169.68s)]
*  A full-corp press featuring all of Kamala Harris's top allies. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1173.12s)]
*  But so far, that strategy has been a disaster. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1177.48s)]
*  First, campaign co-chair Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1181.6s)]
*  She had to finally apologize for that bizarre video [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  that many believe was a cheap attempt [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  at mocking Holy Communion. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1190.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1193.52s)]
*  Love you, I do. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1195.3999999999999s)]
*  Need you, no matter what I do. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1198.12s)]
*  And then Whitmer spent the next several days [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1202.12s)]
*  claiming, no, this was merely a promotion [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1205.12s)]
*  for semiconductor chips, and now has finally been forced [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1207.32s)]
*  to apologize for offending Catholics and other Christians, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1211.52s)]
*  and at the same time, another Harris surrogate, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1215.52s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1218.12s)]
*  Didn't look like he really wanted to be in Pennsylvania [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  before the speech, only seemed to enjoy bashing Trump, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  which is the left's obsession. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1224.8s)]
*  And there, he was scolding African American men, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1226.7199999999998s)]
*  even accusing them of sexism. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1229.96s)]
*  Listen. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1233.16s)]
*  We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1241.52s)]
*  as we saw when I was running. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, I also wanna say that that seems to be [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1249.8s)]
*  more pronounced with the Brugs. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1255.88s)]
*  When I'm speaking to men directly, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1259.16s)]
*  part of it makes me think that, well, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1261.64s)]
*  you just aren't feeling the idea [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1264.64s)]
*  of having a woman as president. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1266.8000000000002s)]
*  And you're coming up with other alternatives [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1269.5600000000002s)]
*  and other reasons for that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1271.44s)]
*  Oh, maybe you're against women. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1273.4s)]
*  Wow, those condescending remarks [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1275.72s)]
*  were not received well at all. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1277.5400000000002s)]
*  Far left activist, Nina Turner, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1279.3200000000002s)]
*  even accused Obama of, quote, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1281.44s)]
*  blaming black men for the Democratic Party's failures. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1283.28s)]
*  The Very Liberal, New York Magazine [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1286.8400000000001s)]
*  calling it, quote, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1288.6399999999999s)]
*  Barack Obama's tiresome condescension towards black men. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1289.6s)]
*  An op-ed in the Washington Post [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1294.0s)]
*  referred to Obama as the scolder in chief [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1295.84s)]
*  and advised the Harris campaign to, quote, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1299.48s)]
*  steer clear of Obama's instinct for, quote, tough love. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1302.04s)]
*  So after a heavy dose of judgment [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1306.48s)]
*  from the former president, in this case, Obama, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1308.6799999999998s)]
*  well, Harris' campaign continues with more surrogates, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1311.6s)]
*  but equally insulting tactics. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1314.76s)]
*  Harris is now promising a handout [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1317.12s)]
*  and cold hard cash up to 20 grand. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1320.12s)]
*  Inforgivable loan forgiveness, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1322.84s)]
*  loans that are only available to black entrepreneurs [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1326.52s)]
*  that they would be the only ones able [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1329.8s)]
*  or eligible to receive it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1331.2399999999998s)]
*  She, remember, also wants to pay off student loans, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1333.0s)]
*  and she's vowing to help African Americans [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1336.2199999999998s)]
*  invest in cryptocurrency. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1338.28s)]
*  And she's calling for marijuana to be legalized. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1340.4799999999998s)]
*  But when you think of the pandering [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1344.0s)]
*  and you think it can't get any worse, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1347.56s)]
*  well, think back. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1349.56s)]
*  She wants to, is this kind of like a vote buying scheme [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  when you want to pay off student loans [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1353.52s)]
*  for young people that you call stupid? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1355.08s)]
*  Or is it $25,000 down payments for your first home [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  or $50,000 for other businesses? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  Or what about her running mate, Tim Walz, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1364.12s)]
*  trying to win over male voters with sports and guns [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1366.8s)]
*  because on Friday during a quick trip [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1370.36s)]
*  to a high school football game, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1372.56s)]
*  where Walz was a assistant volunteer coach [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1375.08s)]
*  that kind of claimed he was the coach, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1379.1599999999999s)]
*  was he was almost ignored by the entire crowd. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1381.08s)]
*  They gave him the silent treatment. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1384.12s)]
*  And then on Saturday, Walz, he wanted to show the world [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1386.1999999999998s)]
*  what a big Second Amendment guy he was, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  and he brought out a shotgun and he went pheasant hunting. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1392.84s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala, she wants mandatory gun buyback. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  Some might call it confiscation. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1400.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, this was also a disaster for Walz. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1402.18s)]
*  He didn't seem to know how to load his own gun. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1405.38s)]
*  You decide. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1409.0600000000002s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1410.8200000000002s)]
*  And it never fits quite right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1411.66s)]
*  Never fits quite right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1413.02s)]
*  Just not quite right. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1414.66s)]
*  How do you give it back? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1415.5s)]
*  Governor, what kind of gun is it? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1418.02s)]
*  This is a Beretta A400. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1419.26s)]
*  I brought, I bought it when I was shooting a lot of trap [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1422.1000000000001s)]
*  because it has a kind of their patented thing, a kickoff. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1425.6200000000001s)]
*  So when you get old, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1428.78s)]
*  it doesn't hurt your shoulder as much. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1430.9s)]
*  It's probably been 15 years since I pulled that sucker out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1433.8200000000002s)]
*  Anyway, of course, this trip wasn't all about guns [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1436.98s)]
*  and hunting. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1439.42s)]
*  Walz also trying to connect with his fellow guy, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1440.26s)]
*  you know, pounding down a Diet Mountain Dew. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1443.9s)]
*  I prefer regular. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1447.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1448.5400000000002s)]
*  No, pen in. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1450.7s)]
*  Pen, pen. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1451.8600000000001s)]
*  That's why it's hunting, not shooting, right? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1453.5800000000002s)]
*  You knew it, didn't you, man? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1455.3400000000001s)]
*  That's not off your right shoulder. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1456.78s)]
*  And I'm gonna grab a Diet Mountain Dew if we got one. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1458.66s)]
*  I'm gonna pound one down. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1461.26s)]
*  Now, if you think that Walz is bad, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1463.42s)]
*  just waiting to hear about the next campaign surrogate. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1465.3s)]
*  Can't make this up either. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1467.94s)]
*  In another desperate attempt to win over men, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1469.54s)]
*  the Harris campaign turned to Bill Clinton. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1472.1399999999999s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1474.54s)]
*  Good to see you, slick Willy. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1475.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm back all by myself. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1476.62s)]
*  Hillary's on vacation. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1477.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, slick Willy is not as slick [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1479.52s)]
*  as he used to be. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1482.02s)]
*  And today, when trying to blame Trump [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1483.1s)]
*  for the border crisis, which was secure [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1485.18s)]
*  when they inherited it, and they bragged about [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1488.0600000000002s)]
*  for three years the border being closed, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1490.38s)]
*  the border being secure, and bragging about undoing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1492.26s)]
*  all the Trump border policies that brought us [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1495.3400000000001s)]
*  the lowest level of illegal immigration in decades, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1497.42s)]
*  Bill Clinton unfortunately kind of indicted [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1500.8600000000001s)]
*  the border czar, Kamala Harris, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1504.72s)]
*  for not vetting the 12 plus million Harris-Biden illegals [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1507.3200000000002s)]
*  from over 180 countries. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1511.1000000000001s)]
*  And Clinton says, oh no, no, I was taken out of context. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1513.3s)]
*  But as always, we report, you decide. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1516.74s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1519.46s)]
*  Listen to what he says about Lakeland. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1520.3s)]
*  Trump killed the bill. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1521.34s)]
*  The bill was written, being written, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1523.98s)]
*  by senior Republicans in the Senate. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  And he killed the bill. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1530.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1532.86s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1535.02s)]
*  They made an ad about a young woman [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1537.34s)]
*  who'd been killed by an immigrant. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1541.98s)]
*  Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1543.22s)]
*  that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1545.38s)]
*  But if they all properly vetted, and that doesn't happen, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1548.6200000000001s)]
*  and America is not having enough babies [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1552.7s)]
*  to keep our populations up, so we need immigrants [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1556.02s)]
*  that have been vetted to do work, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1559.7800000000002s)]
*  there wouldn't be a problem. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1563.88s)]
*  And he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1566.38s)]
*  The bill was not a border security bill. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1569.86s)]
*  It wouldn't have even kicked in unless four or five thousand [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1572.8999999999999s)]
*  illegals first crossed into the country illegally. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1575.34s)]
*  And then they had the discretion of whether or not [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1577.9799999999998s)]
*  they would actually enforce the bill, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1580.82s)]
*  codifying their open borders policies. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1583.6599999999999s)]
*  He's not telling the truth. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1585.82s)]
*  An unvetted, harassed by an illegal immigrant [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1587.3799999999999s)]
*  is accused of murdering Lake and Riley [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1590.6999999999998s)]
*  the same month that the Democrats' so-called border bill [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1593.1s)]
*  was voted down in the Senate. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1597.22s)]
*  So, nice try. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1599.22s)]
*  That bill wouldn't do a thing to secure the border, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1600.8999999999999s)]
*  which they lied about and were telling us [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1603.6599999999999s)]
*  for three plus years was secure, secure, and closed. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1605.74s)]
*  Instead, Harris and Biden, they wanted to use [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1610.3s)]
*  this phony border security bill to hire judges [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1612.6599999999999s)]
*  and bureaucrats to process their unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1615.1799999999998s)]
*  into the country faster. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1618.98s)]
*  Now, this was after more than 12 million [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1620.8999999999999s)]
*  already had poured into our country. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1623.06s)]
*  And while Harris, you know, the borders are, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1625.1s)]
*  looked on, did nothing, lied to the American people, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1627.7s)]
*  said the border's secure. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1630.78s)]
*  Thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, felons. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1632.4199999999998s)]
*  Now we have known terrorists in our country. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1635.7s)]
*  We don't know where they are, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1637.94s)]
*  but we know they have terror ties, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1638.8999999999999s)]
*  all because Joe and Kamala got rid of Trump's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1640.94s)]
*  successful border protections, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1644.26s)]
*  and they did it with a stroke of a pen on day one. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1646.1799999999998s)]
*  They didn't need a bill in the first place. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1648.46s)]
*  And that's why Trump just received a unanimous endorsement [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1650.46s)]
*  from the Border Patrol Union, and Kamala Harris didn't. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1654.46s)]
*  These are the people who see [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1657.9s)]
*  what has been going on firsthand. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1659.74s)]
*  And now as we approach a very important election, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1662.06s)]
*  responsible state governors like Glen Youngkin, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1664.78s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1667.94s)]
*  they have taken measures to clean illegal immigrants, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1669.74s)]
*  non-citizens that are not eligible to vote [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1673.42s)]
*  from the voter rolls. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1676.42s)]
*  In doing so, Glen Youngkin was enforcing a bill [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1677.94s)]
*  signed into law in 2006 by then governor, Democrat Tim Kaine, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1681.94s)]
*  you know, the guy that ran for vice president, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1688.5800000000002s)]
*  requiring the state to maintain [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1690.98s)]
*  the Commonwealth of Virginia's voter rolls, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1693.6200000000001s)]
*  but in a bizarre, crazy, insane twist, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1696.42s)]
*  while the Harris-Biden pro-illegal immigrant administration, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1699.7s)]
*  you know, that now suddenly seems to care [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1703.7s)]
*  about border security, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1705.5s)]
*  they're suing the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1706.94s)]
*  the state of Virginia, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1709.58s)]
*  to keep those illegal immigrants on the voter rolls. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1710.98s)]
*  And by the way, you need picture ID [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1714.78s)]
*  to get into the Democratic convention. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1717.1399999999999s)]
*  I know, because I went there. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1718.8999999999999s)]
*  I know it was a heavy lift. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1720.18s)]
*  You need picture ID to get into a presidential, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1722.3s)]
*  a vice presidential debate or the White House. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1725.46s)]
*  Why not voting? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1728.58s)]
*  Why are Democrats against voter ID, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1729.78s)]
*  signature verification, proof of citizenship? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1732.3s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1735.26s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1736.5s)]
*  I'd adore me too if I were you. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1741.1s)]
*  Happy Monday, everybody. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1744.7s)]
*  So in a viral clip, a McDonald's worker [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1746.78s)]
*  actually mistook Bill Clinton for Joe Biden. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1749.02s)]
*  At first, Bill was disappointed until he realized [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1753.74s)]
*  this means he might be able to bang Dr. Jill. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1756.14s)]
*  Yeah, too old for him. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1761.94s)]
*  According to three new polls, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1764.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris's campaign is falling rapidly [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1765.74s)]
*  behind Donald Trump. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1768.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1770.9399999999998s)]
*  Also falling rapidly, Joe Biden. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1776.34s)]
*  But the Harris team is so depressed by these numbers [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1781.98s)]
*  that earlier today, Doug Emhoff [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1784.62s)]
*  could barely have sex with a nanny. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1786.2199999999998s)]
*  Two of the things look so bad, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1790.86s)]
*  Kamala has already sent her resume to her old employer. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1792.38s)]
*  Tim Walz went on a bird hunt this weekend, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1797.9s)]
*  although he had a little trouble loading his shotgun. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1800.2600000000002s)]
*  He defended himself saying it's different [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1803.46s)]
*  than the one he used when he shot Bin Laden. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1805.46s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1816.3400000000001s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1818.02s)]
*  And today was Columbus Day, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1819.26s)]
*  which here in New York is now known [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1821.38s)]
*  as Indigenous Peoples Day, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1823.3400000000001s)]
*  or as Italians call it, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1826.9s)]
*  oh, I got your indigenous holiday right here! [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1828.46s)]
*  That was my Italian. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1835.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1837.02s)]
*  All right, I gotta calm down now. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1839.94s)]
*  The men of Chippendales have finally voted to unionize. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1842.66s)]
*  They want a healthcare plan, a 401K, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1846.06s)]
*  and the rest of their tuxedo. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1848.06s)]
*  And finally, according to a new survey, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1852.74s)]
*  many adults believe that sex is over way too fast. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1854.34s)]
*  And for some adults, sex has never happened at all. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1859.02s)]
*  Ah, ah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1868.74s)]
*  What a heartwarming way to end [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1872.1s)]
*  our opening things. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1874.94s)]
*  Our very own Virgin Joe Mackey. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1877.7s)]
*  All right, so last week, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1880.06s)]
*  fans of Kamala Harris dropped this ad, Men for Kamala, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1881.74s)]
*  and you might wanna pop a mitol before you take a look. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1886.14s)]
*  I'm man enough to enjoy a barrel-proof bourbon. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1889.5s)]
*  Meat. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1891.98s)]

*  Man enough to deadlift 500 [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1894.42s)]
*  and braid the shit out of my daughter's hair. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1896.46s)]
*  You think I'm afraid to rebuild a carburetor? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1898.54s)]
*  I eat carburetors for breakfast. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1900.54s)]
*  I ain't afraid of bears. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1902.14s)]

*  They wanna control their bodies, I say go for it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1908.54s)]
*  They wanna use the IVF to start a family? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1911.54s)]
*  I'm not afraid of families. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1913.54s)]

*  Good will hunting. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1916.94s)]
*  West side story. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1917.78s)]
*  That and bread. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1918.74s)]
*  I'm sick of so-called men domineering, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1920.1s)]
*  belittling, and controlling women [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1922.7s)]
*  just so they can feel more powerful. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1924.54s)]

*  I hope there were tampons in the men's room [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1929.02s)]
*  at that audition. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1930.82s)]
*  That was as manly as Dylan Mulvaney shaving [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1931.82s)]
*  Rachel Levine's legs. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1934.5s)]
*  Now the ad wasn't authorized by any candidate [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1936.5s)]
*  but it could have been paid for by Trump [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1939.34s)]
*  because it was about as authentic [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  as Tim Walz's war record. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  All those so-called voters were paid actors [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1944.7s)]
*  and not typical actors either as far as I know. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1947.34s)]
*  None are successfully waiting tables. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1949.8999999999999s)]

*  and Brian Stelter's lunch. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1954.7s)]
*  But some of those men were so effeminate [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1956.8999999999999s)]
*  they asked to be paid eight times [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1958.62s)]
*  They were so effeminate they asked to be paid [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1960.18s)]
*  80 cents on the dollar. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1961.7800000000002s)]
*  A sexist would say. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1964.42s)]
*  Not funny. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1968.7800000000002s)]
*  The message was that even real men can vote for Kamala [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1970.26s)]
*  which raises the question. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1974.26s)]
*  If these men are out there then why make this commercial? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1975.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean would they need Kamala supporters [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1979.18s)]
*  to assure them it's okay? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1981.46s)]
*  It's like Kamala is your mom [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1983.5400000000002s)]
*  and she's giving you a note to give to your teacher [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1985.38s)]
*  saying it's okay for Billy to go on a field trip. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1987.78s)]
*  Let's just hope Coach Walz isn't on the bus. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1991.3s)]
*  Do you recall any ads telling someone [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1996.54s)]
*  it was okay to vote for Trump [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1998.02s)]
*  or to vote for anyone else for that matter? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=1999.62s)]
*  Recall any ads from the 80s saying that real men [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2001.7s)]
*  are allowed to vote for Reagan? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2004.18s)]
*  He didn't need it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2005.78s)]
*  He locked down votes for real men, real women, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2006.62s)]
*  even real chimps. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2008.8999999999999s)]
*  It's sad that you gotta prove [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2011.3s)]
*  these men are actually out there. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2014.18s)]
*  Kamala's campaign is like Bud Light trying to win back [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2016.62s)]
*  the alpha males who used to drink it, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  only this time instead of beer it's the Democrat Party. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2020.9799999999998s)]
*  But the fact that you had to hire actors [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2024.1s)]
*  to pretend they're blue collar types who vote for Harris [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2025.86s)]
*  means there aren't any real ones. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  Nope, Dems know that real men see through this bull. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2031.4199999999998s)]
*  After all, look at her husband and her VP. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2035.3799999999999s)]
*  They make Siegfried and Roy look like Olly and Frasier. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2038.58s)]
*  It's getting sad at this point. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2047.1399999999999s)]
*  Listen to actress Jennifer Garner [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2049.98s)]
*  trying to assure male Kamala supporters [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2052.1s)]
*  that they're still men. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2055.14s)]
*  I mean, I'm looking at these beautiful faces, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2056.98s)]
*  these women and these strong men. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2059.14s)]
*  God, is there anything sexier than a man [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2061.02s)]
*  who is like men for Kamala? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2062.9s)]
*  Those men are just cheering because they want free Tampax. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2069.1s)]
*  That video made more scrotum strength [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2073.98s)]
*  than a urologist with cold hands. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2075.98s)]
*  The only way Kamala voters are hot [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2079.54s)]
*  is if they're running a fever. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2082.54s)]
*  And frankly, you'd have to be delirious to vote for her. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2085.14s)]
*  And then there's Obama sensing trouble, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2087.86s)]
*  admonishing black men for not voting for her, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2089.58s)]
*  blaming it on sexism. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2091.46s)]
*  We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2094.02s)]
*  and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2099.18s)]
*  as we saw when I was running. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2104.54s)]
*  I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2106.86s)]
*  with the brothers. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2111.46s)]
*  When you have a choice that is this clear, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2113.14s)]
*  part of it makes me think, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2116.7400000000002s)]
*  and I'm speaking to men directly, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2120.1800000000003s)]
*  part of it makes me think that, well, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2122.62s)]
*  you just aren't feeling the idea [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2125.62s)]
*  of having a woman as president. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2127.78s)]
*  There you go, you're sexist. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2129.34s)]
*  I'm surprised he didn't nag them [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2133.1s)]
*  for not knowing which was their shrimp fork. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2134.38s)]
*  But Obama, shouldn't you be back on Martha's Vineyard, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2137.38s)]
*  you know, where the black population is roughly 3%? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2139.58s)]
*  If he wanted to twist some arms, he should have sent Michelle. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2142.74s)]
*  But meanwhile, as Dems launched commercials for castrados, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2148.58s)]
*  what was Elon Musk launching? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2151.7799999999997s)]
*  New line of robots, a sleek self-driving bus, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2153.62s)]
*  and then a rocket, which he caught on the way down. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2156.86s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2161.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2163.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2165.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2167.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2169.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2171.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2173.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, thank you, sir. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2175.0200000000004s)]
*  It's kind of amazing, I mean, think about it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2177.0200000000004s)]
*  Think about the physics. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2180.0200000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's like lifting Joy Behar into the stratosphere [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2182.0200000000004s)]
*  and then landing her on an aircraft carrier, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2185.0200000000004s)]
*  except lighter. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2189.02s)]
*  But here's a guy who doesn't need to be told it's OK to do anything. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2191.02s)]
*  In fact, they tell him the opposite, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2194.02s)]
*  and yet, look what he gets done. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2196.02s)]
*  The man literally has a spaceship, and it works. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2198.02s)]
*  The people come back alive. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2201.02s)]
*  How many people in history could say that? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2203.02s)]
*  So, if you're looking at men, which side appeals to you more, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2205.02s)]
*  a bunch of broke actors or a billionaire genius inventor? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2208.02s)]
*  Now, when I watched that Harris ad, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2211.02s)]
*  I wasn't embarrassed about being a man, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2213.02s)]
*  because I'm not them. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2215.02s)]
*  Musk, I'm not proud of being a man, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2217.02s)]
*  because I didn't do what he did, he did it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2219.02s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2221.02s)]
*  It's about individuals, not the group. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2223.02s)]
*  It's the point that the Dems always miss, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2225.02s)]
*  which is why they need actors to play what they think are men, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2228.02s)]
*  because they don't know what men are [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2231.02s)]
*  unless they're a group that they can herd like sheep. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2233.02s)]
*  And they embarrass themselves doing it, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2236.02s)]
*  like Tim Waltz trying to hunt. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2238.02s)]
*  That's my theory, and it never fits quite right. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2240.02s)]
*  It never fits quite right. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2243.02s)]
*  How do you give it that? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2245.02s)]
*  Governor, what kind of gun is it? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2247.02s)]
*  This is a Beretta A400. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2249.02s)]
*  I bought it when I was shooting a lot of traps. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2251.02s)]
*  Oh, man. Ah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2255.02s)]
*  It's kind of their patented thing, a kickoff. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2257.02s)]
*  So when you get old, it doesn't hurt your shoulder as much. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2259.02s)]
*  Oh, shut up! [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2262.02s)]
*  You know he doesn't know what he's doing [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2264.02s)]
*  when he's talking through it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2267.02s)]
*  But it's nothing like those weapons of war [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2269.02s)]
*  he claimed he carried into battle, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2271.02s)]
*  which were actually gelato spoons [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2273.02s)]
*  while he was stationed in Italy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2275.02s)]
*  I mean, that was worse than Liz Warren [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2277.02s)]
*  at trying to drink a beer. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2280.02s)]
*  Or as her people call it, fire water. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2282.02s)]
*  But I never know. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2285.02s)]
*  I never know. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2290.02s)]
*  But they're always trying to be everything that they're not, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2292.02s)]
*  which is regular people. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2298.02s)]
*  And what's worse, they don't like regular people. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2300.02s)]
*  So if you're a man, don't let an actor [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2302.02s)]
*  or a Martha's Vineyard elitist tell you how to vote. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2304.02s)]
*  Hell, you don't even need me to tell you that. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2307.02s)]
*  You can make up your own decisions. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2309.02s)]
*  It's how we get honest elections and spaceships that work. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLNnq4quSY&t=2311.02s)]
