# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 25, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0)
*  One last warning from Elon Musk, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=0.0s)]
*  the standard for passing the test was to type some words [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=2.92s)]
*  and press send. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=6.12s)]
*  Yet so many failed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=7.4s)]
*  Subject to the discretion of the president, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=9.16s)]
*  they will be given another chance. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=11.16s)]
*  Failure to respond a second time will result in termination. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=13.46s)]
*  Bureaucrats in Washington are getting a second chance. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=18.52s)]
*  If you haven't told Doge what you did last week, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=21.16s)]
*  you have until tonight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=23.52s)]
*  It's somewhat voluntary, but it's also if you don't answer, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=26.32s)]
*  I guess you get fired. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=28.96s)]
*  What it really is is, what it is is do people exist? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=30.84s)]
*  We have this massive government with millions of people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=35.24s)]
*  and nobody knows who's working for the government, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=38.72s)]
*  who's not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=40.72s)]
*  So what they're doing is they're sending out a letter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=41.92s)]
*  to everybody and they're saying, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=44.64s)]
*  what were the things you did last week? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=45.88s)]
*  I guess they asked for five. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=48.16s)]
*  And if people are working, it's easy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=50.24s)]
*  I could tell you five things I did last week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  I could tell you five things I did six weeks ago, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=53.56s)]
*  A million workers sent in their bullet points. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=56.92s)]
*  That's about half the federal government. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  So a million employees blew off Musk. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  It's been 72 hours for something that takes five minutes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=64.48s)]
*  I can name five things, five bullets, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=69.64s)]
*  in about five minutes of me coming into the office every day. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=72.08s)]
*  If you struggle to do that for a week, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=74.86s)]
*  I have no, there's no excuse for that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=77.4s)]
*  Now you can have an extra day to answer it, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  but you better be able to answer it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=81.16s)]
*  I gave the primetime staff 18 hours for their five bullets [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=83.26s)]
*  and they all met the deadline. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=86.54s)]
*  Here are some of my staff's accomplishments. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=88.54s)]
*  Unjammed the printer after Johnny clogged it, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=91.2s)]
*  printing headshots. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Transcribed three hours of Monica Lewinsky's podcast. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Watched four hours of Iraqi Sesame Street. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  Got yelled at on the phone by James Carville. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=103.7s)]
*  Booked America's heartthrob, Stephen Miller. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  Called 12 farmers who killed their chickens [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=110.62s)]
*  because Biden told them to. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=112.98s)]
*  Skipped lunch five days in a row producing the monologue. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=115.14s)]
*  Maha. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=118.54s)]
*  It's demanding work at primetime, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=120.3s)]
*  so after careful review, no one's getting doged. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=121.8s)]
*  Although Johnny's five bullets were troubling, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=125.76s)]
*  and I'll share those in the window. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=127.9s)]
*  People are taking the bullet points seriously. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=130.02s)]
*  The commissioner of the FCC said, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=133.06s)]
*  "'I'll show you what I did last week. Watch.'" [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=135.02s)]
*  All right, made it to the top with Hassani and his crew. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=138.54s)]
*  They're swapping out the lighting system up here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=141.38s)]
*  Wonderful day with them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  America's tower crews get the toughest jobs done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=145.1s)]
*  Super grateful for their work. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  Maybe you didn't climb a power line or ice some illegals, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  but you've got to send your boss something. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  If you don't respond, it means you did nothing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=157.66s)]
*  Or as Trump says, maybe you don't exist. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  Here's what one former federal worker says [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=164.04s)]
*  is an average day in the office. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=166.26s)]
*  80% of the work in government is done [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=168.98s)]
*  by 20% of the people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=171.44s)]
*  Our government is filled with the most incompetent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=173.06s)]
*  and most lazy people and an occasional hard worker. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=176.62s)]
*  And those hard workers are severely punished [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=181.22s)]
*  every time they outwork their colleagues. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=184.18s)]
*  I use the word work very loosely. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=186.66s)]
*  One employee spent his time remote working, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  running his own farm. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=193.9s)]
*  One employee would come into the office, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=195.62s)]
*  his start time would be 6.30, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=197.7s)]
*  and he knew nobody would be there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=199.7s)]
*  And when I came in at 7.30 [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  and I was the next person to come in, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=203.05999999999997s)]
*  he was snoring at his desk every single morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=204.78s)]
*  Another employee would take the government truck [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=209.54s)]
*  on an almost daily basis so that he could go out to lunch [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=214.7s)]
*  and then go and take a nap in his favorite park [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  under a shady tree in the government truck. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=222.06s)]
*  And those people, they showed up at the office. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=225.66s)]
*  Last week at the Small Business Administration, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=229.98s)]
*  80% of the workers were still working from home. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=232.34s)]
*  Over the weekend, that flipped. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=235.56s)]
*  On Friday, it was like there were tumbleweeds [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  blowing through the office. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=241.14s)]
*  There were still tags left on desk chairs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  And it was my first full day at the agency [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  and I was so excited to be able to meet people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  And to not find anyone there was disappointing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  To have 80% of the people back yesterday was amazing, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=251.26s)]
*  to be able to shake hands. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=254.62s)]
*  And what's happening is Americans are seeing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=256.34s)]
*  that they have been paying for empty office buildings, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=258.56s)]
*  for do nothing bureaucrats, that ends now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=261.48s)]
*  All they had to do was ask the bureaucrats to come back. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=264.84s)]
*  It was so easy, even Biden could do it, but he didn't. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=267.92s)]
*  Biden actually fired people who wanted to come [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=271.92s)]
*  into the office, the ones who wouldn't get vaxxed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=274.32s)]
*  For four years, Joe never tried to save [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=277.48s)]
*  the taxpayers' money. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=280.12s)]
*  The CEO of G.P. Morgan says it's common sense. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=281.72s)]
*  The government's inefficient, not very competent, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=286.12s)]
*  and it needs a lot of work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And so you and I, it's not just waste and fraud, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  it's outcomes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Why are we spending the money on these things? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Are we getting what we deserve? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=295.64s)]
*  What should we change? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=297.52s)]
*  So I think doing that needs to be done. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=298.48s)]
*  I also, you have to understand that whenever you go [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=301.44s)]
*  into any big institution or the government, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=303.2s)]
*  the bureaucracy pushes back on everything. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=305.76s)]
*  And they will hear. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=308.0s)]
*  Every little thing they're gonna push back on, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=309.48s)]
*  so you have to be strong if you're gonna do it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=311.2s)]
*  It's not just about the deficit, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=312.76s)]
*  it's about building the right policies, procedures, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  and the government we deserve. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  Doge has already saved you $65 billion. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=318.88s)]
*  Big Balls just found 35 million bucks [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  for social and behavior change in Uganda. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=325.04s)]
*  We can't change our behavior in America. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=329.6s)]
*  Look at the airports. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  You think you're gonna change behavior in Uganda? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=333.44s)]
*  We're giving the Europeans $70 million [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=337.36s)]

*  It will link our two countries together. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=690.52s)]
*  And after days of panic [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=692.72s)]
*  from the state-run legacy media mob, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=694.2s)]
*  Trump did what he did best. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=696.44s)]
*  He made a deal. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  And now Ukrainian President Zelensky [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=699.48s)]
*  is headed to the White House on Friday [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=701.84s)]
*  to formally sign the agreement. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=704.0s)]
*  Ending this war is in everyone's best interest. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=705.88s)]
*  We don't need more people dying. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=709.12s)]
*  We don't need more buildings blown up. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=710.8s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump has been on the political scene [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=713.24s)]
*  for so long, and they know so little about him [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=715.76s)]
*  is actually frightening. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=718.96s)]
*  Let me give you a clue. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=719.84s)]
*  For those of you in the state-run media mob [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=721.24s)]
*  that I know are watching, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=723.84s)]
*  here's a clue, and those of you on the left. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=724.88s)]
*  He is in a perpetual, nonstop state of negotiation, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=727.12s)]
*  and he puts America first. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=732.64s)]
*  Just keep those thoughts in your head [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=734.28s)]
*  so you don't bubble and fizz like alka-seltzer in water. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=735.96s)]
*  And back in the Oval Office, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=739.5999999999999s)]
*  President Trump celebrated another momentous day [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  with a brand new hat. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=743.56s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=745.7199999999999s)]
*  Look. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=748.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=748.88s)]
*  See that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  Trump was right about everything. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=752.8s)]
*  Just came in. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=754.4799999999999s)]
*  Somebody sent, I said, this was sent in by a fan. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=755.76s)]
*  I said, I think we should make some of them, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=759.76s)]
*  But we were, pretty much. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=762.16s)]
*  You want one? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=763.64s)]
*  I'll pass. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=764.4799999999999s)]
*  Are you allowed to take one? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=766.16s)]
*  Because he'll consider it, I know him well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=767.0s)]
*  He's probably not that quiet. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  He's sort of a stiff. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=768.68s)]
*  Brian, you're not a stiff. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=770.4s)]
*  He's sort of a stiff guy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=771.92s)]
*  He'll take other things, but not a free hat. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=773.5999999999999s)]
*  What, they're gonna get in trouble if they took a hat. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  As you might have noticed, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=779.5999999999999s)]
*  President Trump was once again surrounded by reporters. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=780.4399999999999s)]
*  This is by far the most transparent, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=783.28s)]
*  accessible White House in modern American history. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=785.8s)]
*  In fact, in his first month, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=788.64s)]
*  Trump answered more than 1,000 questions from the press, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=790.4s)]
*  from interviews to press conferences to speeches, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=793.92s)]
*  to scowls, the behind the scenes videos. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=796.56s)]
*  President Trump is seemingly everywhere. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=798.92s)]
*  His agenda is being felt far and wide. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=800.72s)]
*  Illegal border crossings are down almost 100%. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=803.4s)]
*  The FBI and DOJ, which had been weaponized and politicized, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  is now getting dismantled. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=810.04s)]
*  Major companies, look at Apple, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=811.6s)]
*  they're now pledging $500 billion [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=813.56s)]
*  to be spent inside the US, building a plant inside the US, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=817.04s)]
*  creating tens of thousands of jobs right here in our country. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=820.92s)]
*  DOJ has already saved, on record, You the American People, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=824.16s)]
*  an estimated whopping $65 billion, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=828.0s)]
*  and that number is expected to go up dramatically. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=831.0s)]
*  Federal employees are officially back in the office [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=833.72s)]
*  after years of lackluster remote work. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=836.52s)]
*  75,000 plus took a buyout offer, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=839.44s)]
*  and America's great meritocracy is now making a comeback. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=842.24s)]
*  Even the CEO of JP Morgan is now praising Trump and DOJ [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=845.84s)]
*  for taking on America's out of control bureaucracy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=850.12s)]
*  This is all really good news, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=853.64s)]
*  and President Trump's approval ratings [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  are through the roof on top of it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=857.04s)]
*  But if you have a terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=858.76s)]
*  this is a nightmare for you come to life. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=862.24s)]
*  And now top Democrats, they just can't help themselves. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=865.28s)]
*  They lash out morning, noon, and night, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=868.6s)]
*  including the party's rising star, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=870.96s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=873.12s)]
*  Here's her from earlier today. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  If you could speak directly to Elon Musk, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=877.08s)]
*  what would you say? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=879.12s)]
*  F*** off. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=880.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=881.2s)]
*  So enlightening, so productive from the party you love. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=884.04s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, that's about as measured and as eloquent as, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=886.84s)]
*  you know, it gets across the Democratic Party. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=891.4s)]
*  Inside the Capitol, Congressman Hank Johnson. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  Remember, he's the one that famously speculated [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=896.0s)]
*  the island of Guam. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=898.6s)]
*  My capsize and tip over is now fantasizing about [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=900.4s)]
*  President Trump getting arrested by U.S. Marshals. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  If a president willfully failed or refused to comply with a court [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=909.08s)]
*  ruling, they could be held in contempt of court theoretically. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=914.96s)]
*  But it would be up to the U.S. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=919.36s)]
*  Marshals Service, which is a part of the Justice Department, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  to be the enforcement arm for the federal courts. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=929.5200000000001s)]
*  Your hypothetical would have to play itself out. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=932.32s)]
*  It would be the U.S. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=935.32s)]
*  Marshals who fall under the Department of Justice, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=936.5200000000001s)]
*  who would have to carry out the contempt order. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=941.32s)]
*  I can't help it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  Every time I see this guy, I think of Guam [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=947.1600000000001s)]
*  is going to tip over. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=949.36s)]
*  Anyway, it's funnier and gets funnier. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  And it also gets worse. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=953.7600000000001s)]
*  Another left-wing member of Congress [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=955.5200000000001s)]
*  is now asking this age-old question posed [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=957.12s)]
*  by Democrats for centuries. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=959.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=961.36s)]
*  We can't let them deport the millions of families [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=962.92s)]
*  across this country who have been doing the work that [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  keeps our economy going every day. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  If you look at the food that's on your table, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=972.52s)]
*  think about who picked it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=974.92s)]
*  If you look at your homes, think about who built them. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=976.88s)]
*  If you look at your vulnerable elders and your kids, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  think about who's taken care of them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=982.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, the more things change, the more they do stay the same. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=985.12s)]
*  Once again, the Democratic Party seems to value [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=988.52s)]
*  cheap labor above all else. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=991.76s)]
*  As it turns out, this is not the Party of Compassion. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=993.24s)]
*  Instead, this is a hate-filled group [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=996.12s)]
*  of radicalized socialist statists [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=998.92s)]
*  who will say and do anything for status, money, power. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1001.28s)]
*  It's all about them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1004.04s)]
*  In fact, according to the Free Beacon, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1005.3599999999999s)]
*  left-wing groups, oh, you heard all this weekend [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1007.24s)]
*  about all these protests going on in red districts [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1010.4799999999999s)]
*  and how they were angry and lashing out [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1014.3599999999999s)]
*  at Republican lawmakers. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1016.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're so against the Department [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  of Government efficiency. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  And that's all that the mainstream media mob talked about. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1022.16s)]
*  Poll after poll, however, shows just the opposite. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1025.6799999999998s)]
*  Like we showed you last night, the Harvard-Harris poll, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1028.8s)]

*  Can it be? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1122.92s)]
*  The companies we subsidize with billions of dollars [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1123.76s)]
*  are allowing us the privilege to negotiate the price [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1126.08s)]

*  that we should negotiate for all their fucking drugs [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1138.9599999999998s)]

*  that the only way to shame these people [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1170.6s)]
*  would be to accuse them of being normal. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1172.68s)]
*  Now that the NSA has been exposed, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1176.2s)]
*  they're scrambling to contain the damage, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1177.8s)]

*  and are gonna take action. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1180.92s)]
*  But the NSA is the only place where the abnormal [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1182.48s)]
*  is being institutionalized. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1184.76s)]
*  In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers' new budget [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1186.2s)]
*  includes the following changes to language and state law. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1189.0800000000002s)]
*  Mother is now inseminated person. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1192.44s)]
*  Father is now parent, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1195.64s)]
*  and mother is parent who gave birth to the child. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1196.88s)]
*  So we have all these linguistic contortions [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  just so the tiniest portion of society [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1204.04s)]
*  can compel the rest of us to conform [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1206.52s)]
*  to their biological unreality. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1208.8s)]
*  If you want to enable mental illness, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1211.88s)]
*  it would be so much easier to just let the kids smoke crack. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1213.44s)]
*  Governor Evers is a Democrat, of course, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1218.24s)]
*  which makes me wonder, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  why does the party of women keep pretending women don't exist? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1220.92s)]
*  They denigrate motherhood by claiming anyone can do it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1224.56s)]
*  So as this progressive hedonistic outreach spreads, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1227.92s)]
*  one's whims suddenly become superior to biology. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1231.4s)]
*  The self has been replaced by fleeting desires. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1234.64s)]
*  But is it no wonder that liberal women are a mess? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1237.8s)]
*  Pew research showed that a majority [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1240.0800000000002s)]

*  And only 12% of female libs are satisfied with life. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1246.36s)]
*  And they think it's unhealthy [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1250.6s)]
*  to know the difference between girls and boys. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1252.32s)]

*  What you see in school, government, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1256.6s)]
*  and even our elite secretive institutions [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1258.32s)]
*  is a sanctifying of the perverse. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1260.6s)]
*  And when you live a life of perversity, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1263.28s)]
*  eventually you're gonna need people in charge [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  to preserve it on the taxpayer's dime. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1267.56s)]

*  Because here's what's gonna happen, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1366.4s)]
*  I'm gonna call you up and you're gonna do the whole thing. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1367.56s)]
*  Terry, as a parent, I'm gonna roll my eyes, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1370.0s)]
*  I'm like, just wish we had what we used to have. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1372.96s)]
*  Ha ha ha, yes! [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1376.24s)]
*  But congratulations anyway. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, we will dial it back to one day. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1378.4s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1380.3600000000001s)]
*  So you are, you were a Green Beret, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1381.2s)]
*  this is all happening inside the NSA, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1384.04s)]
*  on the work systems. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1387.44s)]
*  Basically it's inter-company email. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1389.32s)]
*  What do you gotta, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1391.84s)]
*  Not good. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1392.8s)]
*  No. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1393.6399999999999s)]
*  There's some dirty birds, aren't they? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1394.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1395.48s)]
*  There's some weirdos, and the thing is they're just weirdos, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1396.32s)]
*  and their whole life is geared towards this kink. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  The big problem is, they're doing it, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  you sort of mentioned it in your thing before, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1405.36s)]
*  that is really compromising. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1407.2s)]
*  You don't think if someone got a hold of that, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1408.6s)]
*  a foreign government, some criminal organization, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1411.12s)]
*  they have such leverage over you. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1413.32s)]
*  And so, get rid of it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1415.2s)]
*  Here's the thing, we've seen all this cool stuff with Doge, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  not cool, we all know, we all knew we were getting had, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1420.08s)]
*  right? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1422.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1423.24s)]
*  But now it's really apparent, we gotta start seeing scalps. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1424.06s)]
*  I don't want people fired, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1426.46s)]
*  I want people put in jail for this stuff. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1429.9199999999998s)]
*  And until we do that, we haven't seen that yet. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1430.76s)]
*  Yay! [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1432.08s)]
*  I just wanna tell viewers at home, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1432.9199999999998s)]
*  we don't mean literal scalps. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  I kinda do though. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  All right, well if you kinda do, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1441.8s)]
*  then we'll just leave it there. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1442.96s)]
*  Leave it there. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1443.8s)]
*  Macky, I'd hate to see what your little sex chats are like. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1444.8400000000001s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1448.48s)]
*  Oh man, cause the magnetic pull you have over women, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1450.0s)]
*  you can get them to do anything. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1453.08s)]
*  It's true Greg, with great power comes great responsibility. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1455.32s)]
*  But honestly, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1458.3600000000001s)]
*  honestly I come to work to avoid my lovers, so. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1460.56s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  But what's interesting to me about this whole debacle [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1466.04s)]
*  is that it's not top down, it's bottom up pun intended. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1468.4s)]
*  My man. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1472.08s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  And this is all to reinforce ideological conformity, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1474.08s)]
*  that's why it comes from HR, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1477.28s)]
*  because there are a lot of people [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1478.4399999999998s)]
*  that won't participate in this garbage, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1480.1999999999998s)]
*  and they're gonna be ostracized at work because of it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1482.6s)]
*  For instance, I think I speak for most people, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1484.36s)]
*  when they talk about their parents, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1488.32s)]
*  they don't wanna ever think about them having intercourse, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1490.04s)]
*  let alone be that the way they describe them. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1493.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1497.1599999999999s)]
*  For instance, no one is gonna be like, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1498.0s)]
*  how's your mom feeling? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1500.36s)]
*  Is she still in the hospital? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1501.52s)]
*  Oh, you mean sperm receptacle? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1503.0s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1505.36s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1506.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's true, it kinda removes that mother child [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1512.68s)]
*  relationship and replaces it [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1516.8s)]
*  with cold and clinical terminology. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1518.68s)]
*  It's pretty gross. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1521.12s)]
*  It seemed to be like in the one [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1521.96s)]
*  that the dad kinda made out though, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1523.92s)]
*  they're like, oh he's just parent. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1525.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1526.56s)]
*  Nice. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1529.72s)]
*  Well, Dennis, welcome to the show, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1530.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm so happy to have you. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1531.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1532.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1533.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1534.2s)]
*  For sure. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1535.04s)]
*  This is pretty crazy, I mean, what's your, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're in Vegas, you've seen everything. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1540.8s)]
*  For these sex chats probably bring back memories. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1543.12s)]
*  Well, a couple of things, apparently, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1546.12s)]
*  Interlink is the new Tinder. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1548.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1551.72s)]
*  And with regards to Massachusetts [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1552.96s)]
*  and what's going on there, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1556.52s)]
*  I stay away from Massachusetts for two reasons. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1558.8s)]
*  One, they burn witches. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1561.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1563.04s)]
*  And two, well, for me, the whole thing about [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1565.52s)]
*  like an 11 year old boy, I have an 11 year old boy. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1570.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1576.04s)]
*  If my kid gets into a fight in school, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1577.24s)]
*  they're gonna call me up and say, you gotta come in, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1580.04s)]
*  your son just got into a fight. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1582.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1583.8799999999999s)]
*  But they won't tell me about what's going on [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1584.72s)]
*  with regards to like how he identifies his gender. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1586.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1589.96s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1590.8s)]
*  This is a thing that is going on. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1591.72s)]
*  And like you mentioned Massachusetts, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1594.6000000000001s)]
*  where the court threw out the parents' appeal [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1596.0s)]
*  because they said like, you didn't tell us [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  that our kid was changing his gender. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1601.88s)]
*  And the court sided with the school. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1604.48s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1608.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, if he had cheated on a test, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1609.2s)]
*  he'd go home, but if he decided to cheat biology [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  in the real world, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1613.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1614.68s)]
*  That makes no sense at all. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1616.04s)]
*  That's why I'm gonna homeschool. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1618.24s)]
*  Oh, that's, I mean, there you go. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1620.6s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1622.48s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1624.28s)]
*  For most people, I think that'd be a good idea. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1625.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, you don't want me homeschooling anything. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1626.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, will you be the teacher? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1629.36s)]
*  Not for you. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1630.28s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1631.12s)]
*  Joe Mackey indirectly made a good point. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1631.96s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1635.04s)]
*  A lot of these people, when they're doing this stuff, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1637.8799999999999s)]
*  don't think about the future. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1640.32s)]
*  That like, they might grow out of this stuff. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1642.1599999999999s)]
*  They might actually decide that they wanna be normal again [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1646.92s)]
*  and have normal relationships, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1649.76s)]
*  but all this stuff is out there. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1652.08s)]
*  What if you have kids and your kids, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1653.92s)]
*  you're gonna read the that's out there? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1655.68s)]
*  Well, also for changing all of the terminology [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1657.48s)]
*  and we're changing it all the time. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1660.0s)]
*  I mean, we have so much literature out there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1661.6s)]
*  There's so many novels, there's so many books, textbooks. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1663.12s)]
*  I mean, what are they gonna do? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1665.96s)]
*  Just change it and like erase everything and rewrite them. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1666.8s)]
*  Like, I don't see that happening. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1669.44s)]
*  It's really quite disgusting what's going on, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  but before I get into it, I just wanna say I appreciate, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1673.08s)]
*  I'm honored to be holding it down [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1676.36s)]
*  as the sole inseminated person on the show. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1677.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, not really though. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1681.1599999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1687.6s)]
*  Well, we hope. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1688.4399999999998s)]
*  Although I guess it really actually isn't correct [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1690.9199999999998s)]
*  to call me an inseminated person at this point in time, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1694.9199999999998s)]
*  unfortunately. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1696.76s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1697.9599999999998s)]
*  But does that make all of you the inseminators? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1699.52s)]
*  Is that what we're calling? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1701.8s)]
*  We are the inseminators. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1703.12s)]
*  It's a new movie. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1705.6799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1706.6799999999998s)]
*  It's really disgusting because the left does like [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1707.6s)]
*  to deem themselves like the feminists, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1710.28s)]
*  the ultra correct all the time. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1713.36s)]
*  And the fact that they're trying to erase womanhood [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  is just so disgusting, it's so vile. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  And the difference in languages, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1718.84s)]
*  we've been taken through this whole process. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1720.4399999999998s)]
*  It has gone from woman to people who menstruate, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1723.04s)]
*  to birthing people, to chest feeders, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1727.24s)]
*  to now inseminated people. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1729.36s)]
*  So I'm curious, what could possibly be next? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1730.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1735.0s)]
*  What would be next? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1735.84s)]
*  This is where they do a dream sequence. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1737.84s)]
*  What would be next? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1739.52s)]
*  We couldn't afford it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1742.0s)]
*  You know what, no, your point is well taken, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1743.6s)]
*  that like they've decided that motherhood [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1746.36s)]
*  is not aspirational. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1749.24s)]
*  Like, oh, you can have this career, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1750.84s)]
*  you can do whatever you want. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1752.48s)]
*  Your motherhood is a burden. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1753.52s)]
*  Unless you're a dude, then it's amazing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1755.76s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1761.04s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1761.88s)]
*  We'll make a womb appear. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1762.72s)]
*  Our baby will come out. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1766.32s)]
*  I can't even do that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1767.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1768.0s)]
*  Even Chris Angel can't make that home. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1768.84s)]
*  Not that good. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1770.72s)]
*  You should do that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1771.56s)]
*  That would be, a man's gonna have a baby. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1772.56s)]
*  All right, we must move on. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_t5-PUzA0&t=1775.76s)]
