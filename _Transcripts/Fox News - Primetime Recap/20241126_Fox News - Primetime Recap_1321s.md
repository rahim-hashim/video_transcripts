# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 25, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE)
*  Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=2.4s)]
*  Just moments ago on Truth Social, Donald Trump revealed one of his first acts as president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=4.44s)]
*  This is a big one. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=10.96s)]
*  On January 20th, as one of his many first executive orders, he will sign all necessary [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=12.1s)]
*  documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products coming into the United [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=17.62s)]
*  States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=24.2s)]
*  And it's ridiculous open borders. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=25.2s)]
*  It's time for them to pay a very big price. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=27.18s)]
*  Most of that of course focus on Mexico there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=30.34s)]
*  More on that later. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=32.7s)]
*  Plus, Eric Trump will react to that and a lot more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=33.7s)]
*  But first, Lawfare loses. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=36.78s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=40.1s)]
*  Well, he came in very hot against Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=42.18s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=47.34s)]
*  Today an indictment was unsealed, charging Donald J. Trump with conspiring to defraud [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  the United States, conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and conspiring and attempting to obstruct [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=56.28s)]
*  an official proceeding. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=63.2s)]
*  The attack on our nation's capital on January 6th, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=64.36s)]
*  the seat of American democracy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=71.56s)]
*  So sanctimonious. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=74.76s)]
*  But it turns out the unprecedented assault on our democracy was committed not by Donald [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=76.44s)]
*  But by the legal henchmen like Jack Smith and their political and media backers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=82.64s)]
*  Now today Smith was compelled to file motions to dismiss his cases against Trump, one of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=88.16s)]
*  which was promptly granted by D.C. District Judge Tanya Chutkin. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=92.72s)]
*  Now this is obviously a huge victory for President-elect Trump, but Smith and his allies tried their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=96.88s)]
*  best to frame the result as not based on the merits, but simply compelled by longstanding [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=102.04s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=106.88s)]
*  This has nothing to do with the strength of the case. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=107.88s)]
*  This simply has to do with the verdict, essentially, that voters gave on the Justice Department [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=110.56s)]
*  policy, longstanding Justice Department policy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=116.36s)]
*  The department is not allowed to prosecute a president, a sitting president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=119.72s)]
*  That shield essentially also applies to him as a elected president, as the president-elect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=123.88s)]
*  Now when the news came out, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that the cases were empty [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=131.2s)]
*  and lawless and should never have been brought. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  They are celebrating. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=138.28s)]
*  Because the goal all along was that they would get these cases dropped. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=139.28s)]
*  The idea of it actually being revived in their mind seems highly unlikely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=143.08s)]
*  This seems like the end of all this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=147.26s)]
*  Well, but not so fast. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=149.2s)]
*  While we love seeing these cases falling into the abyss one after the other, the petty and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=151.44s)]
*  vindictive Jack Smith made sure to request that the cases be dismissed without prejudice, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=156.28s)]
*  meaning? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=162.0s)]
*  These cases could be revived after Trump serves this next term, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=163.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=168.72s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the language that the special counsel used and that the judge uses [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=169.72s)]
*  in deciding this without prejudice, it means that when Donald Trump is no longer president [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=174.0s)]
*  of the United States, these cases could be revived. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=180.24s)]
*  Yeah, theoretically, the charges could be reinstated on January 21, 2029, when Donald [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=183.68s)]
*  Trump is 82 years young. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, Trump's DOJ can and should take actions to ensure that these cases aren't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  just dormant. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  They're dead. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  So as we celebrate Donald Trump's beating the lawfare league at their own game, we should [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  also we must never forget how close they came to upending our entire system of government [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  with their corrupt and illegal use of our justice system. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=215.04s)]
*  Now, remember, they were so desperate to stop Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=218.72s)]
*  The left even tried to use a whacked out interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was a complete [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=222.98s)]
*  joke to prevent him from being on the ballot in key states. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank God they were goose egged by the Supreme Court, which struck down the effort with an [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=232.42s)]
*  exclamation mark back in May. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=235.42s)]
*  But ever since Trump announced his third run at the presidency, the D.C. machine and their [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=238.7s)]
*  venal auxiliaries were intent on locking him up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=244.54s)]
*  They like they like jackals circling a wounded lion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=250.82s)]
*  The search of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=254.82s)]
*  It just sends the message that there is no person in this country who's above the law. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=256.9s)]
*  What we are seeing here is exactly what should be done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=260.46s)]
*  We need to recognize and praise Merrick Garland for following the rule of law. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=263.94s)]
*  The message that it sends is really important that even the former president of the United [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=268.5s)]
*  States can be held accountable and should be and will be. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  When Trump's aides and allies were forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=278.98s)]
*  in legal fees, people's lives were turned upside down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=284.16s)]
*  Then it was, who will turn on Trump first? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  Who will take a plea deal and give up the goods? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=292.22s)]
*  All this speculating was so stupid. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=294.82s)]
*  Then let's not forget following his motorcade in Manhattan to the courthouse. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=297.66s)]
*  What about fingerprints? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  What about the mugshot? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  Everything you're going to be able to see live on TV, they're going to be mugshots. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=304.82s)]
*  Donald Trump will be fingerprinted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  He will be photographed and end up with a mugshot. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  A picture that will live in infamy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=316.46s)]
*  The first mugshot of an American president splashed across the front pages this morning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=318.38s)]
*  Of course he turned that into a huge coup for himself because he's smarter than they are. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=324.02s)]
*  Of course, what about all the taxpayer dollars that were spent on these fraudulent cases? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=328.46s)]
*  We'll never get it back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=333.34s)]
*  And we'll never really know how much was spent. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=334.52s)]
*  The Newsweek estimated that what about 50 million or so was spent by just Jack Smith's team. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=336.58s)]
*  That's an understatement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  So what we saw was a serious concerted effort to use all the resources of the federal government [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=343.62s)]
*  to put Donald Trump in prison for the rest of his life. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=351.2s)]
*  And it was all because they wanted to prevent you, the people, from having your say. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=355.58s)]
*  And of course him from being president. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=360.34s)]
*  So history is going to remember Jack Smith and Alvin Bragg, Fonny Willis, and the judges [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=363.18s)]
*  who let these cases get as far as they did as modern-day Keystone cops who chased Trump [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=368.48s)]
*  around, hounding him, trying to keep him off the campaign trail because they hated his agenda. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=374.72s)]
*  They hate everything he stands for. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=380.7s)]
*  So it's a mistake, though, to write them off as all incompetent. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=384.02s)]
*  Their teams were backed by some of the smartest and toughest meanest lawyers out there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=387.36s)]
*  They worked nights and weekends and through holidays all to put him behind bars and subvert [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=392.26s)]
*  this election. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=398.5s)]
*  The only reason Donald Trump is not in jail now is because of you, the voters. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=400.5s)]
*  And of course Trump himself. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  Imagine if Trump wasn't Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  Forget about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=408.42s)]
*  Most people would have folded like a $20 lawn chair. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=409.78s)]
*  He fought like his freedom depended on it, but mostly because our freedom depended on it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=412.9s)]
*  If Harris had won, this sick weaponization of our justice system would have been validated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=422.14s)]
*  At least for now, it's on ice. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=427.86s)]
*  But despite these setbacks, the angle does not believe the Democrats have given up on [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=430.9s)]
*  this lawfare strategy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  In a statement reacting to the dismissal, Adam Schiff today ripped the system, saying [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  if Democrats, you know, basically saying that the system itself failed, failed the people, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=442.02s)]
*  failed to do what it was supposed to do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=447.26s)]
*  And I'm telling you, if the Democrats somehow manage to take the House in 2026, and they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=449.8s)]
*  could, it is highly probable that they will do everything in their power, stay with me [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=454.04s)]
*  here, to impeach Donald Trump again. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=460.12s)]
*  You think I'm kidding? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=463.56s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=464.56s)]
*  And if Democrats win in 2028, I mean, they're just going to resume the case that we're talking [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=466.04s)]
*  about tonight. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=470.8s)]
*  And they'll probably try to go after Vance as well and anyone else connected to Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  This is why the DOJ has to be cleaned out. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=476.74s)]
*  I think Pam Bondi can do it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=480.2s)]
*  The Democrats and their never Trump poodles have done enormous damage to these institutions [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=482.66s)]
*  and they will do it all again. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=488.74s)]
*  They do not care. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=490.72s)]
*  There should be, however, consequences where appropriate so that this never happens again. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=492.5s)]
*  Biden just handed out a pardon and it's not for Hunter. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=499.18s)]
*  Each weighs 41 pounds and loves to eat a hot dish and teeter-tots and cross-country [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=503.14s)]
*  skis. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=512.5s)]
*  You know, dreams to see, but the real dream he has is to see the Northern Lights, I'm [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=513.5s)]
*  told. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=520.1s)]
*  Through it all, they stayed calm, they gobbled on and still gobbled on. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=521.1s)]
*  Well, fellas, your prayer is going to be answered today. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=526.1s)]
*  Based on your temperament and commitment to being productive members of society, I hereby [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=530.02s)]
*  pardon Peach and Blossom. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=534.86s)]
*  Now we only saw one of the turkeys today at the ceremony. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=539.46s)]
*  Peach was there, but primetime fears that something scary may have befallen Blossom. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=542.38s)]
*  Our minds immediately went to the prime suspect, Commander. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=548.16s)]
*  We hear he has an alibi and we're going to keep you posted. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=552.62s)]
*  We're just told that Peach and Blossom are leaving the White House now together and heading [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=555.3s)]
*  to a farm in Minnesota where they'll see some greener pastures. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=558.82s)]
*  And Biden might join them soon, but before he waddles out the door, there's a Biden who [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=562.86s)]
*  needs a pardon. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=566.98s)]
*  Hunter. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  It was just two Thanksgivings ago that Hunter, during their annual Nantucket family feast, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  convinced his father to run for reelection. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=574.7s)]
*  And we all know how that turned out. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=577.46s)]
*  Biden family Thanksgiving's are legendary. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  It's where Jimmy the Chin squabbled with Frankie Fourfingers over a drumstick and that's how [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=582.1s)]
*  Frankie got his nickname. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=587.4s)]
*  So emotions are going to be riding high Thursday and Hunter set to be sentenced next month. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=589.02s)]
*  He still has a documentary film crew following his every move, so there could be cameras [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  around the table while the Biden family debates the felons fate. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=598.5999999999999s)]
*  The media doesn't care if Biden pardons his son. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=602.68s)]
*  They say his legacy is already in shambles and the big guy has been stabbed in the back [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=605.3s)]
*  so many times. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=608.88s)]
*  What does he have to lose? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=609.88s)]
*  Joe's already fast tracking citizenship for illegals and letting Ukraine fire American [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  made missiles into Russia. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  The question we should be asking is, will Biden leave the White House peacefully? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=618.26s)]
*  So far he's pretending like he is and he's saying his final goodbyes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=623.4s)]
*  He invited donors over to the White House this weekend for a black tie party and he [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  left them with one last message. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=632.26s)]
*  Don't jump in the pool. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  Joe and I are hosting this dinner tonight for a very simple reason. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=638.5999999999999s)]
*  Say thank you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=642.42s)]
*  Thank you to so many dear friends. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=644.02s)]
*  So many of those good friends didn't show up. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=646.32s)]
*  Even the ones who donated millions. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=649.36s)]
*  Insiders who were invited and didn't go are calling it the losers party. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=651.36s)]
*  Many said they didn't want to be associated with the Dems right now because of the embarrassing [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=656.7s)]
*  loss to Donald Trump in the election and anger over the 1.5 billion spent on the campaign [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=660.9000000000001s)]
*  that failed. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=666.9200000000001s)]
*  And after the so-called loser party where the only one who skinny dipped was the president, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=668.7s)]
*  he flew to Staten Island for friends giving. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=672.96s)]
*  Bad news is I'm going to end up feeding you. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  Pastor, thank you sir. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  Say an extra prayer for me. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes, Mr. President. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  Kamala didn't get the invite. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=685.88s)]
*  Instead, the White House posted a picture of her waving bye as she got on a plane. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  Sounds like they've said their last goodbye to Kamala too. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  She's been in Hawaii doing a little soul searching. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=695.72s)]
*  Harris and Dougie Fresh are shacking up at a $1,300 a night, 5,200 square foot vacation [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=698.56s)]
*  villa owned by the Mondavis. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=704.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the wine family. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure Kamala's working her way through the cellar as we speak. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=709.0799999999999s)]
*  Our spies haven't spotted Kamala on the beach or the golf course. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=712.92s)]
*  We hear she's been working the phones while Doug works on his tan. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=716.68s)]
*  She's calling Democrats and saying, I am staying in the fight. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  She's eyeing the White House again. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=725.2399999999999s)]
*  She wants to run in 28. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=728.24s)]
*  And it's not just Republicans who think that's a great idea. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=730.64s)]
*  Some Democrats are open to it too. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=733.92s)]
*  No, really. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=736.0s)]
*  They say she deserves a second shot. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=737.48s)]
*  They say she's up in the polls and she's proved a lot of skeptics wrong as a political athlete. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=739.88s)]
*  Some Democrats though, aren't too sure. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=747.1s)]
*  There's been almost nothing written about how she performs to Kinnit. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  Admirable of her people not to leak about it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=753.24s)]
*  But I guarantee you, particularly the people who worked for Barack Obama and even Hillary [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=755.28s)]
*  Clinton, they know full well what a disastrous candidate they was. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=758.48s)]
*  Obama and the Clintons both knew Kamala was a problem before the election and she didn't [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=762.72s)]
*  prove them wrong. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=766.56s)]
*  Bubba knew the whole time. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  We have to just keep fighting. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=771.04s)]
*  I can't say I was surprised. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  I had the feeling all along that at the end, this thing might break one way or the other [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  and all the so-called swing states would vote together because the last two, three, four [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=780.12s)]
*  percent were actually pretty much alike throughout the country. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=786.6s)]
*  The rage in Cajun's frothing at the mouth like a rabid raccoon. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=793.24s)]
*  He's letting the Kamala campaign have it for appeasing woke millennial interns. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=796.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=800.84s)]
*  Not only am I not interested in your opinion, I'm not even going to call you by your name. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=802.2s)]
*  You're 23 years old. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=809.08s)]
*  I don't really give a s*** what you think. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=810.76s)]
*  And let me tell you another huge error, huge s*** error this way, is when people said campaigns [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=814.12s)]
*  need to reflect progressive values. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  No they don't. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=824.88s)]
*  No they don't. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=827.24s)]
*  If I were running a 2028 campaign and I had some little snot-nosed 23-year-old saying [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=828.24s)]
*  I'm going to resign if you don't do this, not only would I fire that mother****** on [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=834.88s)]
*  the spot, I would find out who hired them and fire that person on the spot. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=839.28s)]
*  I'm really not interested in your uninformed stupid jack****** opinion. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=845.8s)]
*  Democrats got lucky with the pandemic and won the White House with Biden and they knew [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  they got lucky with all those mail-in ballots out there, but they were too afraid to acknowledge [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=856.68s)]
*  that. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=861.92s)]
*  They put this tough guy act like they could do it again, when deep down they knew they [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  didn't have the bench or ideas to repeat. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  A blind man can see the Democrats got their ass kicked. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  You have no bull****. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=872.88s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=873.88s)]
*  Trump's been the Republican nominee since 2016. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=875.24s)]
*  It is clear that that's who conservatives want in the White House. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=879.8s)]
*  That's who they supported. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=885.68s)]
*  When you look at the Democrats, they greased the skids. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=886.8399999999999s)]
*  This is the person we want. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  It's her turn. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  It was Hillary's turn in 2016. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=891.5999999999999s)]
*  That's for the voter to decide. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=892.82s)]
*  And then I looked at the bull**** and they had no one. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=895.0600000000001s)]
*  They had no one. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=898.2600000000001s)]
*  They had no one that could compete with Donald Trump. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=899.58s)]
*  Just like they were afraid to tell Joe to step down, now they're afraid to tell Kamala. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=904.38s)]
*  Democrats can't tell a black woman who got more votes than Obama to take a seat. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=908.62s)]
*  The best they can do is whisper it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=912.74s)]
*  An anonymous Democrat tells Politico, I can't conceivably imagine the party turning to her [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=915.1800000000001s)]
*  a second time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=919.9000000000001s)]
*  The Democrat power brokers are being diplomatic and trying to give her an off-ramp to be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=921.74s)]
*  governor of California. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=925.62s)]
*  But she's worried it might be a step down in prestige. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=927.58s)]
*  The princess has always been a little concerned with optics. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=930.84s)]
*  But Democrats have a way of making decisions for the politicians. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=933.98s)]
*  You know, you can't let the people decide these things. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=937.62s)]
*  So if Kamala does run again, she better watch out. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=940.6s)]
*  People who are thinking about 2028, they've got very skilled staff. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=945.74s)]
*  They're going to start to leak stories to make sure that she doesn't jump to the front [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=949.74s)]
*  of the line and cut them out. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=954.02s)]

*  I was like, you know, looking at that mom, like, Julie, Julie Andrews, you're shocking [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=995.6600000000001s)]

*  But I don't know, maybe I didn't see the first part of the argument. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1006.5799999999999s)]
*  Hi baby. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1009.42s)]

*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1036.22s)]
*  And tonight we begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1037.22s)]
*  Tonight a monumental win for Donald Trump and the rule of law. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1039.18s)]
*  The weaponized, politicized Biden-Harris justice system is now waving the white flag of surrender [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1043.14s)]
*  thanks frankly to all of you, the American people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1049.64s)]
*  Earlier today, federal prosecutors, they dropped all charges against Donald Trump stemming [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1053.3s)]
*  from the bogus January 6th case. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1058.02s)]
*  It is now officially over. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1060.56s)]
*  There'll be no trial in the Washington swamp. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1062.22s)]
*  There'll be no conviction. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1064.34s)]
*  There'll be no jail time. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1065.4599999999998s)]
*  There'll be no fines. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1066.4599999999998s)]
*  On ex-president elect, Donald Trump reacted, quote, these cases, like all of the other [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1067.6599999999999s)]
*  cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless and should never have been [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1072.52s)]
*  brought. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1077.82s)]
*  He continued, quote, it goes on, it was a political hijacking and a low point in the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1078.82s)]
*  history of our country that such a thing could have happened. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1083.3s)]
*  And yet I persevered against all odds and I won. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1086.4199999999998s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1089.6999999999998s)]
*  With the election over, the DOJ is suddenly no longer interested. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1090.8999999999999s)]
*  How amazing in pursuing a case as we have reported over and over. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1094.86s)]
*  It is now crystal clear to all these charges were never about justice. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1099.1399999999999s)]
*  And the American people rejected all of the nine years of smear, slander, besmirchment, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1104.9399999999998s)]
*  lawfare, weaponization of justice, the politicizing of the FBI in our intelligence community. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1111.34s)]
*  They rejected it overwhelmingly this past election as they rejected legacy media, which [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1118.8s)]
*  is dead. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1124.34s)]
*  Instead, this was always a blatant effort by, unfortunately, actors, Democrats, your [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1125.34s)]
*  federal government to destroy Donald Trump, prevent him from ever becoming president again. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1132.34s)]
*  They've tried their best. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1137.86s)]
*  It is amazing that this man is still standing after all that they threw at him. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1138.86s)]
*  But the American people, they knew better. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1143.4199999999998s)]
*  And now it's critical that the Department of Justice undergo much needed reforms. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1145.6s)]
*  Measures need to be put in place so this can never ever happen again to anybody, Democrat, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1151.7s)]
*  Republican. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1157.6200000000001s)]
*  The days of anti-Trump, anti-Conservative witch hunts are over. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1158.6200000000001s)]
*  And needless to say, Democrats are not particularly happy. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1162.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1166.22s)]
*  Well, look, I certainly understand why he did it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1167.22s)]
*  Given the Department of Justice policy that you cannot prosecute a sitting president, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1170.5s)]
*  I think it is a shame for justice in this country. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1175.8600000000001s)]
*  Of course, now there's no accountability either using the constitutional method of impeachment [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1180.14s)]
*  or the courts. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1186.7800000000002s)]
*  One of the things is we saw all these cases and they never broke through because the media [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1188.46s)]
*  is different. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1192.5800000000002s)]
*  They're also very worried about what will happen to the rule of law now that these signals [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1193.5800000000002s)]
*  are being sent to Trump's base. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1197.8600000000001s)]
*  You have one man who has managed to really escape justice in all of the various ways [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1200.22s)]
*  that feels very unsatisfying in terms of the rule of law in this country. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1209.18s)]
*  And it makes us more akin to regimes that we heretofore have denigrated. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1215.5s)]
*  There needs to be a little introspection and self-reflection in a moment like this. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1221.42s)]
*  And maybe the fact that they lied to the American people, they peddled conspiracy theories, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1226.46s)]
*  they gave selective information, didn't always tell the truth. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1231.44s)]
*  Maybe that was the reason the American people widely rejected this. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1235.62s)]
*  But the hysteria on the left, it is now far, it is wide. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1239.34s)]
*  It appears the self-proclaimed saviors of democracy are having a difficult time with [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1242.98s)]
*  the election results. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1247.86s)]
*  In fact, at Biden's own State Department, they organized multiple therapy sessions to [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1248.86s)]
*  help their employees cope with Donald Trump's win. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1254.06s)]
*  According to the Washington Free Beacon, quote, one source describing the meeting as a cry [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1257.1799999999998s)]
*  session. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1263.58s)]
*  What would the mullahs of Iran, Putin and President Xi think of that? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1265.14s)]
*  And like almost every major department in the Washington swamp, the State Department [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1269.6200000000001s)]
*  is filled to the brim with woke anti-Trump Democrats who, according to one source in [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  the Free Beacon, are unwilling or unable to faithfully serve in the Trump administration. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1278.66s)]
*  Good. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1283.18s)]
*  It will be a lot easier time for Elon and Vivek. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1284.18s)]
*  It will be a monumental task flushing out hyper-partisan bureaucrats out of the incoming [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1287.42s)]
*  Trump administration and really return to constitutional order, which is all I as a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1294.3s)]
*  conservative have believed in my whole life. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1299.06s)]
*  It has got to be done for the sake of the country and for to give a Trump any chance [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1301.56s)]
*  to succeed. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgxHuMttfE&t=1307.66s)]
