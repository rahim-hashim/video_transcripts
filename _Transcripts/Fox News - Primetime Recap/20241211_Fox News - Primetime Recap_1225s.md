*  There's something lingering around Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=0.0s)]
*  And watch out. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=7.6000000000000005s)]

*  A litmus test for me and my friends for like years now [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=79.72s)]
*  has been if the guy we're talking to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=83.64s)]
*  follows Joe Rogan on Instagram, they're a red flag, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=85.44s)]
*  and we should probably stop talking to them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=88.6s)]
*  They haven't learned a thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  They're still living in a bubble that popped five weeks ago. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=92.8s)]
*  And they lost because they put themselves in a bubble, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=96.28s)]
*  and they put themselves in such a bubble, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=98.16s)]
*  in such an echo chamber that they don't even know [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  what people outside of that bubble [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  and echo chamber are talking about. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  I was having this conversation with them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  I was saying that, you know, man, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  and I was saying it publicly too. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=110.32s)]
*  I said, you know, I feel like a lot of the energy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  and the enthusiasm that exists for the vice president [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=114.52s)]
*  is largely within the party. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=117.32s)]
*  It's largely within that bubble. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=120.36s)]
*  Democrats, when they talk to their butcher, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  their doorman, their driver, their dry cleaner, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=125.32s)]
*  they never noticed none of these people [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  made a point about their pronouns. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=129.32s)]
*  Hey man, I'll have two ribeyes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Excuse me, it's she her. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=133.56s)]
*  They never noticed that never happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  The raging Cajun says, what are you, stupid? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=139.24s)]
*  We're not here to be a debating society. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  We're not here to like score debate points. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=148.64s)]
*  So we're not here to advocate unpopular things, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=151.72s)]
*  although we think there are the right things to do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=157.12s)]
*  We're really here to win God-d*** elections. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=160.32s)]
*  That's why we exist. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  So wait a minute, if you have an idea [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=165.44s)]
*  and no one talks about it, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=168.28s)]
*  and you still insist that it was a good idea, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=170.48s)]
*  well it didn't make any sense. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=173.12s)]
*  If it was a good idea, it's popular people to talk about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=175.2s)]
*  Now don't come here and tell me [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=177.32s)]
*  that this identity language, this silly dictionary crap [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=179.44s)]
*  that people engaged in wasn't a political liability. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=183.84s)]
*  It clearly was. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=187.92s)]
*  This was a political stupidity on a level [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=189.2s)]
*  that's self-inflicted. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=192.48s)]
*  After raiding Trump's house, staging a coup, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=195.0s)]
*  and pardoning Hunter, they lost whatever moral high ground [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=197.24s)]
*  they claimed to have had. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=200.28s)]
*  Now even Cuomo can't trust them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  You were creating an impression of a standard [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=205.0s)]
*  that you never had any intention of holding up yourself. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=207.12s)]
*  And the Democrats have proven the problem [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  with their actions. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=215.36s)]
*  Those New York cases, Charlie, were crap. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=217.16s)]
*  And they only brought them to try to slow down Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=221.08s)]
*  We both know it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=224.08s)]
*  And what they did with Kamala Harris [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=225.28s)]
*  is proof that they don't give a shit [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=229.44s)]
*  about any higher standard. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=231.16s)]
*  They didn't even allow for democratic process [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=233.16s)]
*  in their own stupid little club [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=235.52s)]
*  where they can do whatever they want. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=238.12s)]
*  It's more than just an issue of not trusting Democrats. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Americans can't even hear them [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=243.48s)]
*  because their delivery vehicle's broken. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=245.72s)]
*  Kamala's campaign guy says the party structure, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=248.56s)]
*  it's basically a tear down. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=251.64s)]
*  For the left, our amplification ecosystem [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=253.88s)]
*  is the mainstream media in Hollywood. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  And the mainstream media in Hollywood, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=259.48s)]
*  A, don't really mess with us, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=261.44s)]
*  or they're not actually allies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=263.36s)]
*  And they're not where these voters [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=267.32s)]
*  who don't want to pay attention to politics are. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  Like we're sitting here at Harvard [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  at a big event with the mainstream media, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=273.56s)]
*  and this is like voters out there [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  that we actually needed to reach are not seeing this at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  And they're not seeing mainstream media at all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=280.76s)]
*  And I think fundamentally, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=283.16s)]
*  we have a mismatch between the amplification engine [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=287.24s)]
*  of the left and the media of this moment, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  which is increasingly alternative anti-establishment. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=293.24s)]
*  Democrats are alone, and now they're broke. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=296.68s)]
*  Kamala blew through two billion and left her party in debt. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=299.36s)]
*  So the donors turned into tightwads. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=302.72s)]
*  Joe might never break ground on his presidential library. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=305.68s)]
*  And now we're hearing he's canceled [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  from the speaking circuit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=310.64s)]
*  Biden may never remember he lives to see [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=313.16s)]
*  the building of a library, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=315.76s)]
*  in part because of his age, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  but also because he's gonna have trouble raising money. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=318.04s)]
*  And I don't know, is he gonna get a big book deal? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  Is he gonna get paid speeches? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  Like he's about to go from a guy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=324.92s)]
*  who was a senior senator for decades, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=326.92s)]
*  then vice president, then out briefly, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  but then back as president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=332.04s)]
*  This is gonna be a shock to the system. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  You think he's feeling kind of irrelevant now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=334.96000000000004s)]

*  And I'm not sure he's gonna be equipped. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=340.56s)]

*  Who? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=348.96s)]
*  Besides the Chinese. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=349.8s)]

*  And at this point, he's more worried about his own legacy [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=353.4s)]

*  Sources inside of Biden world say Biden doesn't think [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=358.47999999999996s)]

*  You know, within the first two months of office, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=375.56s)]
*  I signed the American Rescue Plan, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  the most significant economic recovery package [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=380.04s)]

*  He signed checks for people who are 7,400 bucks [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=386.36s)]
*  because we passed the plan. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=388.6s)]

*  If Bidenomics was so great, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=398.88000000000005s)]
*  why'd the Democrats get wiped out? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=400.52000000000004s)]

*  He's already taken himself out. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=462.76s)]
*  Cass says Trump had the guts to pull the Bush dynasty [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=465.28s)]
*  and their endless wars out of the GOP by the roots. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  And in November, the Republicans pulled off a sweep. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=472.32s)]
*  Will a Democrat with Trumpian guts [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=475.96s)]

*  Luigi Mangione. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=542.32s)]

*  seemingly this guy had it all, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  born into a wealthy Maryland family. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=551.04s)]
*  He was a prep school valedictorian. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=553.36s)]
*  He went on to earn not one but two degrees [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=555.5999999999999s)]
*  from the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=558.1999999999999s)]

*  Brian Thompson, allegedly shooting the father of two [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=563.36s)]
*  in the back just before a 7 a.m. morning [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=567.0s)]
*  in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, some who feel wronged by the health insurance industry [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  and others on the left that want to quote, eat the rich, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=576.96s)]
*  they are actually out there celebrating this assassination, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=580.84s)]
*  this murder, glorifying the purported killer. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=584.96s)]
*  People are actually buying T-shirts and merchandise [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  promoting the murder. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=592.98s)]

*  unglued, you decide. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=608.48s)]
*  Why would you be in such a celebratory mood [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=610.96s)]
*  about the execution of another human being? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=614.28s)]
*  Aren't you supposed to be on the caring, sharing left [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=617.48s)]
*  where you believe in the sanctity of life? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=620.4s)]
*  I do believe in the sanctity of life [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=624.88s)]
*  and I think that's why I felt, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=627.0s)]
*  along with so many other Americans, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=628.96s)]
*  joy, unfortunately, because it feels like... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=631.08s)]
*  Joy? Serious? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=633.52s)]
*  Joy demands execution. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe not joy, but certainly not empathy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  Something a bit unexpected has happened [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=641.76s)]
*  following the murder. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=644.6s)]
*  A reaction not of universal horror, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=645.76s)]
*  that a 50-year-old father of two and husband [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=648.28s)]
*  was shot dead in public, but rather of, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=650.4599999999999s)]
*  and I don't want to call it glee, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=652.8s)]
*  but let's just say not unhappiness. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=654.64s)]
*  I was looking at some of the social media comments [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=657.36s)]
*  and I try to stay away from social media, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=659.36s)]
*  but it said some of the comments were thoughts [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  and deductibles to the family. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=663.76s)]
*  One of the comments was, unfortunately, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=665.88s)]
*  my condolences are out of network. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=667.6s)]
*  And so I think it really, isn't that something? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=669.8s)]
*  I really think it's reflective about how people [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=672.16s)]
*  are feeling about their healthcare. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=674.24s)]
*  Okay, no doubt there are Americans [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=676.96s)]
*  that have very legitimate and serious concerns [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=679.4s)]
*  about the healthcare industry in our country, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=682.04s)]
*  which frankly has become even more expensive and complex [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  with fewer options after Obamacare, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=688.56s)]
*  but that's separate and apart. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=691.44s)]
*  Cheering for the murder of an unarmed man is beyond sick. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  And unlike Mangione, all United Healthcare CEO, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=698.32s)]
*  he did not grow up in a world of privilege. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  Brian Thompson, he's from a small town. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  He's from Iowa. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  His father worked a green elevator. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=707.72s)]
*  He attended public school, the University of Iowa. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=710.24s)]
*  After college, he worked his way up the corporate ladder. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=713.44s)]
*  Brian Thompson was a father of two, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=716.72s)]
*  an avid supporter of the Special Olympics. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, maybe you have an issue with your health insurance [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  or your car insurance or your home insurance, fine. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=725.36s)]
*  You can hate a company. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=728.24s)]
*  You can hate the entire insurance industry, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=729.64s)]
*  but murder, assassination, vigilantism, it's wrong, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  it's evil, it's despicable. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=737.28s)]
*  And Luigi Mangione is no hero. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  And according to reports, his behavior apparently [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  became very erratic over the last six months. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=744.88s)]
*  And today, his theatrics again on full display. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=747.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=750.72s)]
*  So this is the left wing in America, the new hero, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=761.08s)]
*  a seemingly deranged Ivy League grad accused [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  of shooting an unarmed father of two in the back. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=767.6s)]
*  And meanwhile, Daniel Penny, he is treated like a monster [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=770.48s)]
*  by many on the left. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  In fact, New York's woke prosecutors, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=774.76s)]
*  they tried to ruin his life. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=777.32s)]
*  He was a hero in real life. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=779.0s)]
*  After the former Marine, he was only trying to protect [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=781.0s)]
*  his fellow passengers riding on the New York City subway [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=784.24s)]
*  underground from a violent individual, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=787.28s)]
*  his name Jordan Neely, who had an open warrant for his arrest, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=789.96s)]
*  a history of gruesome subway assaults, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=794.12s)]
*  including two elderly people, one a woman. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=796.72s)]
*  At the time of the incident, Neely was high on drugs [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=799.32s)]
*  and lunging at passengers while threatening to kill those [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=802.36s)]
*  around him and himself. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=805.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=807.48s)]
*  And what was he saying? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=824.28s)]
*  What was he doing? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=826.64s)]
*  What drew your attention to him? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=827.48s)]
*  He said, at first, when he came on, you know, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=832.4s)]
*  and the doors closed, and as soon as the doors closed, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=834.88s)]
*  he was carrying a jacket, and he whipped the jacket down, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=839.88s)]
*  and it landed on the feet. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=843.88s)]
*  I was standing, and it landed on the feet of the passengers [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=846.2s)]
*  sitting down next to me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=848.76s)]
*  And the zipper made a very audible noise. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=850.6s)]
*  It was very loud and very aggressive. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=854.92s)]
*  And at that point, the train car went completely silent. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=856.6s)]
*  It almost felt like a vacuum. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=862.84s)]
*  And there was like this hollow feeling. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=866.8s)]
*  And that's when I first kind of gave him my full attention. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=870.0s)]
*  OK, so the train becomes silent. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=875.16s)]
*  What, if anything, does he say? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, he first comes on, and he starts demanding things. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=880.32s)]
*  He's demanded three different things, you know. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=886.68s)]
*  Certain types of food, certain types of drinks, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=890.64s)]
*  and things that, like some type of fast food. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  And that he was willing to go to jail forever [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=899.2s)]
*  if he didn't get these things. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=901.9200000000001s)]
*  And then it kind of escalated. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=904.4000000000001s)]
*  He was saying, you repeated, I was [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  going to go to jail for life. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=909.24s)]
*  I'm willing to hurt people. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=910.64s)]
*  I'm willing to kill people. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to kill people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  And keep in mind, this is all within 15 seconds [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  of him getting on the train. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=918.72s)]
*  And it was this escalation of violence and threatening [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=920.84s)]
*  behavior that it was just pretty serious. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=924.76s)]
*  When he said he was willing to kill people, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  did you believe him? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=931.64s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=932.76s)]
*  It was unlike. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, because there's outbursts on the train [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=935.48s)]
*  all the time. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=937.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, in New York City, there's always people coming on [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=938.0s)]
*  and saying kind of talking crazy. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=943.88s)]
*  And this was unlike anything that I've ever experienced. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=948.76s)]
*  And it was very serious. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=953.92s)]
*  I completely believed what he was saying. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=959.64s)]
*  It was just. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=961.4s)]
*  What was the reaction by the fellow subway riders? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=962.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, like I said, when there was that silence, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  when there was that vacuum, I mean, everybody [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=968.8399999999999s)]
*  got everybody's attention. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=974.28s)]
*  How close was he to the people as he was telling them [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=976.28s)]
*  or saying, I'm going to kill someone? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=980.36s)]
*  He started off in the middle of the train by the pole. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=982.1999999999999s)]
*  And then in that escalation, he started [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=985.4s)]
*  to get in people's faces within a foot of people. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=988.88s)]
*  What was there? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=992.36s)]
*  There was a woman with a baby in a carriage? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=993.3199999999999s)]
*  What did she do? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=996.16s)]
*  Women, children, kids going to school, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=996.76s)]
*  coming back from school. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1000.04s)]
*  It was what you'd expect on a normal New York City subway [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1002.84s)]
*  train or subway car. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1005.4s)]
*  It was. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  The mother was holding her child. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1010.48s)]
*  And the school kids were protecting themselves. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1013.44s)]
*  They were holding each other. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  And people were stuck to their chairs. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1019.36s)]
*  And they felt pinned. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1025.28s)]
*  And I felt pinned. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1026.92s)]
*  I felt nervous. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1028.16s)]
*  I felt scared. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1028.88s)]
*  Now, thankfully, this week, Penny [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1030.72s)]
*  was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1032.0800000000002s)]
*  and rightfully so. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1035.0s)]
*  But the ladies at that hard-hitting news show [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1036.28s)]
*  The View, they're not happy about the verdict, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1038.64s)]
*  even though we had witness after witness after witness. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1041.0s)]
*  And those that tried to make this issue about race, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  including an African-American woman that was on the train, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1046.24s)]
*  had actually said thank you to Daniel Penny, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  saying that they felt their life was in jeopardy. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1051.4s)]
*  Maybe they didn't hear or read about that testimony. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1053.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  Penny's defense was that he was de-escalating the situation [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1057.96s)]
*  after Neely threatened other commuters. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1062.72s)]
*  And he celebrated the verdict with his lawyer [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1064.8400000000001s)]
*  while Neely's family was mourning the loss. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1070.16s)]
*  I mean, you killed a guy. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  The man is dead. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1075.96s)]
*  And maybe you just take the celebration home. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1076.92s)]
*  You don't do it outside. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1080.0s)]
*  But that's just me. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1080.96s)]
*  Don't listen to anything I say. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1081.96s)]
*  You know, I do wonder. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1085.04s)]
*  Does ABC send limousines and SUVs for the ladies of The View, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1086.92s)]
*  or do they take the subway? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1093.04s)]
*  Do they ever take the subway? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1095.04s)]
*  Daniel Penny stepped up to prevent his fellow subway [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1097.2s)]
*  riders from being harmed by a guy making death threats, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1099.96s)]
*  acting erratically. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1103.16s)]
*  He shielded every single person on that subway car [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1104.52s)]
*  from harm, black, white, men, women, everyone. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WKv_l-hy98&t=1107.76s)]
