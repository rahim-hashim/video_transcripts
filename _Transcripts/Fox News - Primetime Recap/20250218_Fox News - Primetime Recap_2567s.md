# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 17, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM)
*  Even the holiday weekend couldn't slow Doge down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=0.0s)]
*  There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=3.12s)]
*  Persnickety librarians were getting Doge silly. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The Dewey Decimal System's next. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=9.84s)]
*  It was pink slip city at the FDA, Medicare, and Medicaid. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=12.32s)]
*  And the IRS is on deck. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=16.48s)]
*  These are foreign nationals who come into the United States, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=19.36s)]
*  they use fake social security numbers, they use fake identities [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=22.96s)]
*  to steal billions in taxpayer benefits. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  There's no way to know until Doge gains full access [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=28.96s)]
*  exactly how much money we're talking about. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=31.92s)]
*  But over a 10-year normal budget window, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=34.56s)]
*  you could be talking about saving over a trillion dollars [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=37.04s)]
*  by clamping down on massive fraud in our tax and entitlement systems, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=40.08s)]
*  including, again, those carried out by organized fraud and theft rings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Biden hired 87,000 IRS agents, gave them guns, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=49.28s)]
*  and we're getting ripped off to the tune of a trillion bucks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=52.64s)]
*  Because Biden had his sights set on America's real enemy, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=60.16s)]
*  Right before Inauguration Day, Biden's IRS audited Pistol Pete. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  Biden sons a tax cheat, and he's auditing Hegseth, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  the incoming defense secretary who doesn't have enough on his plate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=69.92s)]
*  keeping America safe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=73.44s)]
*  So now Elon and Big Balls are going to audit the auditors [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=75.44s)]
*  and upgrade the software because they're using programs from the 1960s. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=78.56s)]
*  Democrats are hysterical that Elon and Big Balls are opening up the books [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  because they assume Elon will just abuse their power like they did [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  and audit their political enemies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  You remember, like, Lois Lerner? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  And then she fried 24,000 emails so Congress couldn't investigate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=96.72s)]
*  Democrats leak Trump's tax returns to Maddo. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Maddo's, like, waving them live on TV. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=104.08s)]
*  That's a felony. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=108.0s)]
*  And they're worrying about Musk? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are already in prison for doing what they're accusing Musk of. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=111.2s)]
*  Whose tax returns is he going to leak? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=115.76s)]
*  Hunter's? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  He didn't file any. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=117.92s)]
*  Almost 1,000 people have full unmasked access to taxpayer data. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=119.84s)]
*  20 of them are student researchers, basically interns, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=125.12s)]
*  have access to your tax returns. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=128.32s)]
*  Democrats don't care. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  They only care when the guy who has access might find fraud. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=132.32s)]
*  Like all good detectives, Doge is following the money. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=136.96s)]
*  Next up on the list, Fort Knox. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Home to the largest gold reserve in the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=144.0s)]
*  And we go years without sending inspectors in. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=146.72s)]
*  How much gold does Fort Knox hold? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=150.72s)]
*  Only one way to find out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=153.44s)]
*  This all happening while massive amounts of gold bouillon [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  are being flown in from London vaults. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=158.48s)]
*  It can't all be because Judge Jeanine's going jewelry shopping. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=161.28s)]
*  Can it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=165.04s)]
*  Dozers are still sniffing out the bacon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=166.48s)]
*  Here's what they found this weekend. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=169.76s)]
*  35 million for a gender equality and women empowerment hub. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=171.6s)]
*  A girl hub where women hang out and pump each other up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Sounds like a sorority. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=180.72s)]
*  29 million to strengthen political landscape in Bangladesh. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  That is so generic. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=187.6s)]
*  It could be anything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=189.12s)]
*  Strengthen the political landscape. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=190.64s)]
*  It's vague for a reason. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=192.72s)]
*  Doge says we spent 21 million for voter turnout in India. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=195.28s)]
*  Now imagine if the Indian government spent 21 million [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=200.16s)]
*  dollars for voter turnout in America and Trump won. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  When they do it, it's election interference. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=207.28s)]
*  When we do it, it's strengthening the political landscape. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=209.2s)]
*  One and a half million for voter confidence in Liberia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=213.84s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=217.92s)]
*  Giving pep talks to Africans before they cast ballots? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=218.72s)]
*  You got this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=222.16s)]
*  We got this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  It's going to work this time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Why are we spending so much money on other countries' elections [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=226.16s)]
*  while we're still counting votes in California? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=230.32s)]
*  Those also found 14 million for social cohesion in Mali. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=233.44s)]
*  Mali is run by mercenaries and plagued by ancient ethnic warfare. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=238.88s)]
*  Not to mention landmines, torture, sexual violence, and child marriage. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=243.84s)]
*  I'm sure that 14 million is just what Mali needs to be socially cohesive. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=248.64s)]
*  And two million to help Kosovo and Egypt recycle. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=253.84s)]
*  We don't even recycle here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  What, are we just buying them blue bins? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=260.4s)]
*  We just bombed the bejesus out of Kosovo and now we're telling them to recycle. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=263.28s)]
*  A new report says the government's already nearly a trillion dollars in the hole for the year. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=268.48s)]
*  Democrats should not fight this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=274.08s)]
*  Their boys, Bill and Al, were for Doge before Doge was cool. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=276.24s)]
*  Mr. President, if you want to know why government doesn't work, look behind you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=280.8s)]
*  The answer is at least partly on those forklifts. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=287.28s)]
*  Is this the way it has to be? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=293.76s)]
*  Well, the good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=296.0s)]
*  We can cut it dramatically. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=299.44s)]
*  We can downsize government by 12 percent, reducing the bureaucracy by 252,000 positions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  Doge is forklifting the fraud out of Washington. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=309.44s)]
*  So what are Democrats doing? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=312.64s)]
*  Sheryl Crow says she's selling her Tesla and donating the money to NPR. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=314.56s)]
*  And rhinos are roaring at Democrats to do something. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  So I'd just like to see somebody wake the hell up and get excited about the fact that your country [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=323.84s)]
*  is under assault. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=329.44s)]
*  They're not at the gate anymore. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=330.56s)]
*  They're in your bedrooms. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  They're in your living rooms. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  They're in your business. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=336.56s)]
*  They're in your businesses. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=337.92s)]
*  They got your data, dumbass. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  They got all your stuff. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=341.92s)]
*  Elon Musk has his tentacles in everything you're doing, not just off of X. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=343.68s)]
*  But now he's in the Treasury Department. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=348.88s)]
*  He's in the Labor Department. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=350.88s)]
*  He's in the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=352.8s)]
*  And nobody seems to give a damn. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=355.6s)]
*  So that's all I want somebody to show that they care enough to get out their fat ass [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=357.6s)]
*  and say something about it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=363.44s)]
*  What Steele's saying is the Democrats believe the government's theirs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=365.44s)]
*  It's not your government. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=368.88s)]
*  It's theirs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=369.92s)]
*  To them, it's like Doge is auditing the DNC. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=371.12s)]
*  So this is just another Watergate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=374.24s)]
*  They're acting like Trump didn't win the election and he has no right to run the government. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=376.56s)]
*  Instead of defending the taxpayers, the media is defending the government. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=381.92s)]
*  Here's 60 Minutes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=386.48s)]
*  People are really scared. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=388.48s)]
*  I think that, you know, 12 days ago, people knew where their next paycheck was coming from. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=390.08s)]
*  They knew how they were going to pay for their kids' daycare, their medical bills, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=394.64s)]
*  and then all gone overnight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=399.28s)]
*  All gone overnight for Christina Dry and Adam Dubard, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=402.64s)]
*  fired this month in the chaotic shutdown of foreign aid. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=407.28s)]
*  They're not looking for competency. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=411.52s)]
*  They're not looking for if you're good at your job. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  They're looking for peer loyalty tests. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=414.64s)]
*  And if you don't give it, you will be punished. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=416.64s)]
*  There was no process. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=419.28s)]
*  No one explained to them why they were being relieved. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=420.8s)]
*  To my knowledge, they received an email. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=424.0s)]
*  And then if they didn't leave the building, they were escorted out of the building. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=425.92s)]
*  These people got generous buyouts. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=429.92s)]
*  Eight months severance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=432.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, but did CVS interview the fired Keystone Pipeline workers, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=434.0s)]
*  the fired army officers who refused the needle, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=438.32s)]
*  or black Americans who lost their job to migrants? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=440.96s)]
*  No. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=443.76s)]
*  That one lady was Samantha Powers' speechwriter. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=444.72s)]
*  She's no random civil servant. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=448.32s)]
*  She's the top flack for the USAID chief. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=450.48s)]
*  Just last week, this same lady told ABC she was pocketing her pride flags. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=454.4s)]
*  The networks are using the same victim over and over. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=459.76s)]
*  Coach was in the building. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=464.4s)]
*  We started, we took down our pride flags. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=466.08s)]
*  We took down, I took out any books I felt would be incriminating. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=468.32s)]
*  No one was talking. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=472.0s)]
*  We heard they started taking transcripts automatically of all of our Google meets. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=473.28s)]
*  We, they unplugged the news in the little kitchen galleys. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=478.08s)]
*  It didn't feel good. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=481.76s)]
*  And then Saturday, all of the websites went down. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=482.96s)]
*  And then I lost complete access to my computer. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=485.76s)]
*  60 Minutes is CBS's premier investigative unit. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=489.2s)]
*  And they never mentioned the 20 million for Iraqi Sesame Street. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=492.96s)]
*  Or sex changes in Guatemala or DEI operas. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  Or all the dough spent on failed coups. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Never mentioned it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=502.16s)]
*  We're 36 trillion in debt. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=503.6s)]
*  We're cutting headcount, just like media organizations do to balance their books. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=505.92s)]
*  Just like Clinton and Gore did. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=510.16s)]
*  Last week, Vance was in Germany and told the chancellor to knock off the censorship [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=512.88s)]
*  and step up their NATO spending. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  And the American media sided with the Germans and called Vance Hitler. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=519.84s)]
*  He was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=526.0s)]
*  And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=532.32s)]
*  And some historic ties to extreme groups. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=537.76s)]
*  The context of that was changing the tone of it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=542.16s)]
*  And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=547.84s)]
*  No, I have to disagree with you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=552.16s)]
*  Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=554.88s)]
*  The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=557.12s)]
*  because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they had a list of. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=561.6s)]
*  People they hated, but primarily the Jews. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=565.92s)]
*  There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=569.92s)]
*  There was none. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=571.76s)]
*  It was illegal to criticize the Nazi government. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=572.8s)]
*  It was against the law to tell a joke about Hitler. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=575.92s)]
*  And he had a dumb mustache and one testicle. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=578.24s)]
*  Couldn't joke about it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=581.04s)]
*  Newspapers were shut down. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=582.88s)]
*  Books were burned. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=584.16s)]
*  Radio stations were censored. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=584.88s)]
*  Free speech didn't trigger the Holocaust. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=586.56s)]
*  CBS's crack research team's too busy editing the Kamala interview to learn that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=589.52s)]
*  On the same day, CBS celebrated an armed raid in Germany because a guy posted a cartoon. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=594.24s)]
*  It's 6.01 on a Tuesday morning and we were with state police as they raided this apartment in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=601.7600000000001s)]
*  northwest Germany. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=608.48s)]
*  Inside, six armed officers searched a suspect's home, then seized his laptop and cell phone. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  Prosecutors say those electronics may have been used to commit a crime. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=619.68s)]
*  The crime? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=624.88s)]
*  Posting a racist cartoon online. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=626.0s)]
*  And it's a crime to insult them online as well? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=628.4799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  If somebody posts something that's not true and then somebody else reposts it or likes it, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=631.76s)]
*  are they committing a crime? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  In the case of reposting, it is a crime as well because the reader can't distinguish [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=640.2399999999999s)]
*  whether you just invented this or just reposted it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=645.12s)]
*  Germany is letting migrants into the country who are committing gang rape. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=649.28s)]
*  And they have cops kicking down doors over a cartoon. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  CBS is defending Germany, a country who started two world wars that cost millions of lives. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  And who tariff our automobiles quite unfairly, I might add. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=662.72s)]
*  They're defending a country who booze our national anthem, Canada. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=667.36s)]
*  Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America, and the media is defending Mexico. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=672.64s)]
*  The media is defending the IRS. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=678.72s)]
*  The media is defending cockamamie spending like millions for Egyptian recycling. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=681.84s)]
*  Trump has the left defending the indefensible. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=686.96s)]
*  The Democrats have become so toxic that Politico is warning them to just stay out of the way. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=690.24s)]
*  Despite this intense daily barrage of negative reporting, Trump's drive to slash the size of the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=695.76s)]
*  U.S. government remains one of his most popular policies. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=702.32s)]
*  And there's no sign of it stopping anytime soon. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump's in the driver's seat and Democrats are getting lapped. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=711.12s)]
*  And for all of you in Canada, thank you for watching. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  You need to start securing your own border. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  You need to start contributing to your national defense because you rely on us. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  And you need to start paying your fair share to NATO. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=724.4000000000001s)]
*  And if Canada doesn't want free trade, okay, there will be reciprocal tariffs. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  It has to work both ways. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  Even before Donald Trump was sworn into office, Canada charged hefty tariffs on [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=734.72s)]
*  certain American agricultural products. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  They completely blocked other products. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  And for some reason, the U.S. also regularly is giving Canada [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=745.2s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=750.0s)]
*  We don't deserve to be booed and we're not going to take that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Thanks to Doge, thanks to Elon Musk, this kind of unusual spending in the name of foreign aid, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=756.0s)]
*  that is going to come to an end and not a moment too soon. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=762.24s)]
*  And according to testimony from the CEO of LexisNexis, more than a 1 trillion of your [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=765.28s)]
*  hard-earned tax dollars stolen during the height of COVID. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=770.64s)]
*  Most of that money going abroad, not helping Americans. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=774.32s)]
*  And the GAO reporting last year alone, Biden wasted $236 billion. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=777.92s)]
*  That is nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars wasted in a year. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=785.36s)]
*  And meanwhile, Elon Musk discovers this, reveals it to the American people. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  He announced even more than 20 million people over 100 years old. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=795.28s)]
*  20 million are still listed on the Social Security database. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  In other words, the federal government could, we don't know yet, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  but they're listed on the database. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=807.52s)]
*  They could be sending checks to people who are long dead [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  or their relatives that are cashing the checks. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=812.16s)]
*  Now, of course, Doge is rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, corruption all across the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=814.64s)]
*  federal government. They've already recovered billions and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=818.96s)]
*  billions in wrongful spending while reducing the size of government. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  And liberals now are screaming into the void. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=825.84s)]
*  And, but here's an interesting point that I'm pretty sure the mainstream state-run [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  media mob won't tell you about because it wasn't long ago, top Democrats, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=834.4000000000001s)]
*  people that you know were advocating for Donald Trump's very plan. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=844.88s)]
*  This report tells us how to cut waste, cut red tape, streamline the bureaucracy, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=846.32s)]
*  change procurement rules, change the personnel rules, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=853.5200000000001s)]
*  and create a government that works better and costs less. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=856.8800000000001s)]
*  By paying for these plans, first with cuts in government waste and efficiency, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=861.44s)]
*  second with cuts, not gimmicks in government spending. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=866.32s)]
*  We'll prove that we can spend the money we have in an appropriate way and stop wasting so much. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  But over the next several months, we will be looking at every other agency and program, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  asking the direct question, do we really need this agency? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=880.96s)]
*  Do we really need this program? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  20 years into a period in our history where most American wage earners [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=886.32s)]

*  to have rules and regulations which take those people's money from them [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=898.6400000000001s)]
*  and spend it on things that cannot be justified. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=902.32s)]
*  One of the commitments that I made the American people was that we would do a better job [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=905.44s)]
*  here in Washington in rooting out wasteful spending. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=910.96s)]
*  Ah, amazing. They sound like Donald Trump, except they never got the job done. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=916.1600000000001s)]
*  How times have changed. Now tonight there are reports of a collective panic in the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=920.72s)]
*  Washington swamp, a flood of new real estate listings as Trump dismantles the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=924.88s)]
*  Washington bureaucracy at a rapid pace. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=929.52s)]
*  Of course. Of course. I know. I know. I know. Enough. It's natural to feel that way. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=931.84s)]
*  Happy Monday, everyone. So today is President's Day. The only federal institution open today [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=959.04s)]
*  is Bill Clinton's pants. It is his favorite holiday, of course, because he can always get [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=965.92s)]
*  a good deal on a mattress. According to the White House, Sapphires, while visiting Donald Trump in [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=972.24s)]
*  the Oval Office, Elon Musk's four year old needed a diaper change. Luckily, there was plenty left [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=980.88s)]

*  five hundred and seventy seven days outside the White House, mostly because he couldn't remember where he lived. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=996.48s)]
*  Conservative writer Ashley St. Clair announced on X that Elon Musk is the father of her child. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  This will be Elon's thirteenth kid. Turns out he can build a rocket. He just can't protect his. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1014.24s)]
*  She said she knew Elon was the father when the baby turned his pacifier into a telescope. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1024.72s)]
*  You know, speaking of babies, people have asked me, Greg, why haven't I posted any pictures of my [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1032.3200000000002s)]
*  baby? Well, first off, I respect my family's privacy and I hope you do too. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  But since it's now a topic of discussion, I guess I can share one photo. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1042.56s)]
*  I hear it starts to look more like me as the baby gets older. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 and drove a lap around the track. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  Kamala would never have done this if she were president. She only talks in circles. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1065.76s)]
*  A Brazilian couple, aren't they all, has set the world record for the longest marriage, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1073.04s)]
*  eighty four years and seventy seven days. The husband credits their long union to one simple thing. He's deaf. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1078.56s)]
*  It's a heartwarming tale. Finally, on Saturday, the US versus Canada hockey game started off with three fights in the first nine seconds. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1086.64s)]
*  I was glad to see our hockey players stand up for America. But still, you shouldn't hit women. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1096.64s)]
*  All right. Just joking, Canucks. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1108.8s)]
*  So right now, the Democratic Party is about as popular as a monkey pox enema. But the Democrat implosion is actually nothing new because it happened to the other guys eight years ago. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1113.44s)]
*  Remember that before destroying the Democratic Party, Donald Trump destroyed the Republican Party by making the old guard seem timid and obsolete. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1124.08s)]
*  Paul Ryan suddenly became the political equivalent of an outhouse. It's still out there in the fields, but no one goes near it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1132.08s)]
*  So what Trump accomplished is really amazing. He saw both parties as the same thing and took them both down. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1139.92s)]
*  Seriously, who can who else can kill a party just by showing up? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1149.12s)]
*  The current Democrat Party may not be completely dead, but it's definitely on a ventilator. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1157.68s)]
*  And if same Democrats still exist, they got to wise up. They need a dose of medicine. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1162.72s)]
*  If they still exist, they got to wise up. They need a dose of common sense, tough love and possibly some ozempic. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1167.1999999999998s)]
*  So here's Dr. Gregg ready to write the prescription. First, let's give Hitler a rest. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1172.32s)]
*  Faces calling everyone Hitler has been about as successful for the left as the Views swimsuit calendar. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1179.12s)]
*  And yet here's CBS's Margaret Brennan arguing with Marco regarding JD Vance's speech on free speech, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  claiming the Nazis weaponized free speech to carry out the Holocaust. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  He was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1201.12s)]
*  Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1211.04s)]
*  and they hated those that they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1215.6799999999998s)]
*  There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1219.6s)]
*  Nice. Weaponizing speech to conduct genocide? What does that even mean? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1222.6399999999999s)]
*  Where did she go to school? Dumb community college? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1227.52s)]
*  I say community because she was too stupid to get into the four-year. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1233.28s)]
*  Fact is all Vance did was defend the First Amendment against those who see it as bad. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  And from that assertion, Marge got to Hitler. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1243.6s)]
*  Makes me think she got that job because of her looks. And she's only a six. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1247.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, prescription two, lay off the hoaxes. Remember that old line, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1252.08s)]
*  a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth puts on its boots? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1263.6s)]
*  Well, that was before we knew how the fake the media was. Thanks to an enlightened public, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1267.52s)]
*  the hoaxes now get stomped by the boots of truth before they even get out of bed. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1272.24s)]
*  Perfect example, the hoax that Pete Exith was drinking scotch at a NATO presser [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1277.52s)]
*  when it was obviously water. But when you're desperate and stupid, you'll push anything. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1281.76s)]
*  Sorry, Dems. It's you who need the intervention, not him. Thank God he wasn't drinking tomato juice [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  or Democrats would accuse him of being hot Dracula. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1292.16s)]
*  Now, rather than creating hoaxes, you might want to see what you're for as opposed to against. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is the hard part, because what is your party now? If you've lost the Nazi name [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1307.6799999999998s)]
*  calling and the hoax matrix, what's left? And I get it. Trump's found the middle ground on all [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1312.56s)]
*  issues and it's called common sense. It's not left or right. That structure no longer works here. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1318.24s)]
*  Go ahead and try it. The high ground is called the high ground for a reason. There's no place to flank [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1324.6399999999999s)]
*  it. So you find so you have to find new ground instead of taking theirs. And you can't win being [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1330.08s)]
*  the party of cutting off little kids balls. It's an obvious point, which means it's time to declare [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1336.56s)]
*  war on what destroyed you, meaning the woke virus that you mistook as thinking. You need to cut the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  cord of the activist class that so terrifies you. That means, however, they will call you names. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
*  But the New Democratic Party must realize that to exist, you can't rely on accolades. Praise doesn't [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1355.36s)]
*  build anything. You should have learned that in 2024. Support from the woke didn't increase the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1362.16s)]
*  quality of life. It didn't make safer streets, cheaper eggs, a secure border, jobs with good [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  wages. It ended no wars. All it did was make Rachel Levine feel like a woman and Bud Light feel like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1372.64s)]
*  because for that virus, that victim virus to endure, it can never make things better or it [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  stops existing. I go back to my old zombie analogy and a zombie flick. There's so much struggle to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1388.32s)]
*  avoid how to become a zombie when maybe it's just better to let the zombie bite you early on. Then [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1395.2s)]
*  you're on their side and they leave you alone. Meanwhile, you can work your way up the zombie [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1401.12s)]
*  ladder. That's what the Dems did with the woke. They gave into the mind virus all because they [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1406.32s)]
*  didn't like the hassle of having to fight it. They were scared. But of what? Thinking for themselves. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1413.36s)]
*  But for wokeness to work, everyone has to bite. But America didn't. And now you lost everything. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  So now what Dems? Are there issues that Trump missed? Can you grab them and not only make your [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1425.84s)]
*  lives better, but ours too? Or at this point, can you even find them when you're still clinging to [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1431.52s)]
*  the noxious past? It might start soon. Otherwise, it's your funeral. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1436.96s)]
*  Let's welcome, tonight's guest, even his shadow is white box, your contributor, Tom Shaloo. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1442.8s)]
*  She's always direct and never incorrect. Editor in chief of the Federal is Molly Hemingway. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1454.64s)]
*  He's always the funniest guy in the soup kitchen. Founder of Studio TSC.com, Michael Loftus. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1460.24s)]
*  And she's got a baby on board and won't be ignored. New York Times Best Selling Author and [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1468.96s)]
*  Function's Contributor, Kat Jue. Tom, I like all the layers you're wearing today. I count 16. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1473.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I know. I like to layer up, Greg. Yeah, it's true. It's true. You know, you like to help. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1483.92s)]
*  People I've noticed that and you have liberal friends. Do you if you felt that they could take [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1489.52s)]
*  your advice, what would you give them? Well, I give them to them all the time through this show, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1496.16s)]
*  Greg, because I know liberals and conservatives like watch the king of late night, Greg Gutfeld. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. But I think you are harsh on Margaret Brennan. Really? She knows her history. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1505.28s)]
*  She knows the Nazis weaponized free speech. I'm also a student of history. You know what else the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1512.88s)]
*  Nazis did? They they tried to prevent the von Trapp children from singing about their favorite things. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1518.08s)]
*  That they did many bad things, Greg. Yes, that is true. Yeah, they they they stole the Ark of the [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  Covenant from Indiana Jones. Yes. He took it back, though. And they put it in that warehouse. I hope [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1531.6s)]
*  Doge figures that out. They got to get that in that big warehouse. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1541.2s)]
*  They tried to prevent Hogan and his buddies from digging underground and [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1549.2s)]
*  planting bombs all over Germany. That is true. They were up to no good, the Nazis. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  So she knew that. No, I think they. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1560.72s)]
*  the Democrats should just embrace Doge because, you know, like you said in your monologue long ago, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1566.96s)]
*  they they claimed that they wanted to cut down on government waste. So if they just [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1574.48s)]
*  embrace Doge and they say, well, that's not the problem we have with Trump. But everybody [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1579.2s)]
*  knows if you cut government waste, you're going to be the hero. So they should stop trying to [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1582.3999999999999s)]
*  fight it. They should say, look, we don't really like Trump. We don't really like Elon Musk. But [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1586.56s)]
*  if they find anything, God bless them. Yeah. You know, Molly, you were tweeting a lot about the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1591.44s)]
*  Brennan Rubio interview. And I believe now when you hear the word weaponization, it means that [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1596.24s)]
*  they don't really know what they're saying. Like it's like that word always carries the weight of [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1604.0s)]
*  the sentence. And she struck me as thoroughly checked out of the building at that point. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, it is rare to see that combination of condescension and arrogance and just complete [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1615.76s)]
*  idiocy. It doesn't really go together very well. But, you know, you give this speech on free speech [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1620.8s)]
*  and the importance of religious liberty and freedom and listening to your voters. And you think, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1626.32s)]
*  who could really be against this? And in comes Margaret Brennan to be like, I'm against that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1631.76s)]
*  Those are bad things. And many other people in the media are doing it as well. And it's just like, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1636.96s)]
*  no one in history has been on the side of good if they were suppressing speech. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1642.32s)]
*  Yeah. And yet that's what they're going all in on. You know, what kills me is [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1647.12s)]
*  JD Vance had did two speeches in like a week that were great. That one and the AI speech. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1650.16s)]
*  And it makes you think about like, Kamala, for years, she didn't give two speeches that were any good. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1656.4s)]
*  You know, you don't have to applaud. It was just me coming to that realization very slowly. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1664.96s)]
*  And I will admit it was kind of boring at that point. I was actually bored making that like thought. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1675.12s)]
*  Loftus, you depend on the kindness of strangers when you're living on the streets. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1683.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes. Can you return the favor to our fellow Democrats? Because it seems to me [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1687.4399999999998s)]
*  they don't have a path until somebody gives it to them. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  They don't. They've experimented with a couple of different ways of pushing back against Doge. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1695.36s)]
*  They're like, I don't think Elon Musk and his boys are good at math. I'm worried about the math. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1701.28s)]
*  Yeah. He catches rockets with chopsticks. So shut up about the math. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1707.92s)]
*  They're like, oh, he might have your social security number. I don't know. He ran PayPal. Okay. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1712.64s)]
*  So they really have to do the Casablanca thing where they have to be like, we're shocked, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1718.72s)]
*  that there's government overspending. Oh my goodness. That way then they get in on it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1726.4s)]
*  Like I declare we should start a committee of our own just to check his numbers and make sure [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1731.44s)]
*  maybe my sister-in-law could be on that committee. And that normally pays two million a year. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1738.88s)]
*  I can't get enough Doge. I want a Doge 24 hour channel. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1747.52s)]
*  Doge it all. Pinch every penny. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1752.5600000000002s)]
*  Kat, good to see you as always. You're a trooper. I realize that you as a libertarian, me basically [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1760.64s)]
*  Republican libertarian, we're used to abuse. So we don't care what people think. I think Democrats [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1770.64s)]
*  have a real problem with praise. They need it. And so that's why they could never turn away the woke [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1776.56s)]
*  because they were so dependent on being liked by them. What's, is that a good theory, a bad theory, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1783.28s)]
*  or just, that's a good theory. Well, I really want to talk about the free speech thing because [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1790.0s)]
*  there's a huge misconception right now that makes no sense to me about what free speech is and who [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1795.92s)]
*  it's for. In recent years, there's been this misunderstanding that somehow free speech is a [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1801.84s)]
*  tool of the powerful, but that's backwards. It's a tool against the powerful. Marginalized people [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1807.4399999999998s)]
*  throughout history have understood this. Social justice leaders throughout history have understood [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1816.72s)]
*  this. Whether you're talking about Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony have understood [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1820.0s)]
*  that unpopular ideas or people who are oppressed are the ones that need free speech to be able to [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1823.04s)]
*  speak out against the powerful. And the way that people talk about that, they've completely lost [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1828.48s)]
*  sight of that. It's completely backwards and it's almost as stupid as thinking that there was free [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1835.04s)]
*  speech in Nazi Germany. Yes. But it's also maybe why they're having trouble. Like you were saying [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1839.52s)]
*  that common sense is what the Trump is. He picks these issues where 80% of people agree, but because [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1844.32s)]
*  of censorship, that 20% has been elevated and people think that's like a much bigger opinion [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1850.0s)]
*  than people have. Because of their suppression and free speech, they've now written themselves out [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1855.92s)]
*  of power. Yeah. And also I'm trying to think of any issue that Trump hasn't or it's like I said this [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1859.92s)]
*  on the five that it's like showing up at Walmart on Saturday after Black Friday, Trump's picked [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1866.0800000000002s)]
*  through everything, you know, like every single issue he has gotten there and gotten right in the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  middle and you show up and you go like, ah, well on gender, he kind of did the right thing on the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1879.6s)]
*  border. He kind of, and you're like going like, well, what's, there's no, I'm trying to think, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1886.48s)]
*  what is the new issue? It might be AI in the future, something like that, but I can't see it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1890.0s)]
*  He got all the easy ones too, like the penny. Yes. They could have gotten rid of the penny [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1895.6s)]
*  when I was a kid. Plastic straws. Yes, exactly. Plastic straws, pennies, dudes in locker rooms, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1900.24s)]

*  Up next, fans of the maple leaf are causing us grief. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1914.24s)]

*  committed to giving back. You've been there, done that, and you're still here for more. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1932.96s)]

*  be proactive with Capvaxiv, a vaccine specifically designed for adults to help protect against [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1943.1200000000001s)]

*  allergic to the vaccine or its ingredients. Tell your doctor if you have a weakened immune system. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSBFOSKVJM&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
