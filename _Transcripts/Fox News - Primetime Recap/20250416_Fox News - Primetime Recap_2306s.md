# Fox News Highlights - April 15th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU)
*  Spanish class is in session. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I'd like to teach you how to say, let's make America great again in Spanish. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=8.6s)]
*  So America grande otra vez. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=13.36s)]
*  America grande otra vez. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=17.16s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=19.84s)]
*  The sources tell primetime Trump's learning how to say you're deported in Spanish too. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=20.84s)]
*  Estas deportado. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=25.76s)]
*  And Democrats are saying no mas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=27.92s)]
*  The constitutional crisis is here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=30.92s)]
*  In that meeting in the White House, Donald Trump essentially told the Supreme Court to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=33.28s)]
*  pound sand. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=37.04s)]
*  Because far from what he says is what he doesn't say. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=39.28s)]
*  And that is nowhere in that entire meeting does the President of the United States ask [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=43.96s)]
*  the President of El Salvador to return the man wrongly sent to a maximum security prison [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=47.92s)]
*  in his country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  It just never happens. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=54.42s)]
*  The President has taken a very determined step towards dictatorship. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=56.74s)]
*  Does it feel like a constitutional crisis? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=61.7s)]
*  That a legal alien gangbanger from El Salvador is back in El Salvador? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  After all the times they've declared constitutional crisis, this one's got to be the weirdest. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=68.62s)]
*  If deporting gangbangers makes you a dictator, then I'm all in. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=74.1s)]
*  They're now saying we shouldn't arrest gangbangers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=78.18s)]
*  The people who deport gangbangers, they should be arrested. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=80.94s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, and Tom Homan, the head [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=85.74s)]
*  of ICE, must be arrested immediately for contempt of court. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=90.5s)]
*  They're defying court orders to return Mr. Abrego Garcia from captivity and torture in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=95.1s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=101.86s)]
*  It is time to teach the Trump administration a lesson. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=102.86s)]
*  Was Keith in a straight jacket? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=107.78s)]
*  That was hard to say. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=109.62s)]
*  Democrats charged Trump with 91 counts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=111.5s)]
*  He beat the rap, got elected and deported illegal to where he was born. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=113.26s)]
*  Something almost all Americans want. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=118.02s)]
*  But Democrats, and this is why they lost, want to charge Trump with another crime. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=120.1s)]
*  Kidnapping. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=125.62s)]
*  I think the attorney generals play a really important role right now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=127.94s)]
*  I think it's only a matter of time before one of them figures out how to file state [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=132.98s)]
*  kidnapping charges against those that are abducting people who are in this country legally [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=138.1s)]
*  and sending them to this new concentration camp that Donald Trump laughs about having [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=144.26s)]
*  created in El Salvador. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=149.42s)]
*  Attorney generals are going to play a critically important role in these days ahead, fighting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=151.54s)]
*  this fascist moment in American history. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=155.94s)]
*  Just as Democrats can turn a man into a woman, they can turn deporting into kidnapping. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=158.7s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=163.78s)]
*  And Senator Van Halen from Maryland is flying to El Salvador tomorrow to break the gang [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=165.02s)]
*  banger out of jail. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  So you've got a Maryland man who's the father of three, illegally detained in a notorious [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=172.9s)]
*  prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=182.46s)]
*  I do intend to go to El Salvador to discuss the release of this individual who is illegally [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  detained in El Salvador. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=191.38s)]
*  It is absolutely unjust and illegal to have this Marylander detained one more day in a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=193.98s)]
*  notorious prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=203.5s)]
*  He's a Marylander? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  Since when? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  If I break into Mexico, am I a Mexicano? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=213.62s)]
*  Maryland mom, Rachel Morin, was raped and murdered by an MS-13 member from El Salvador. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  And Senator Van Halen is trying to spring a member from the same gang out of prison. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=220.06s)]
*  Trump's getting gang bangers out of Maryland and Maryland politicians are trying to fly [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=225.34s)]
*  him back in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=228.82s)]
*  And late night hosts are now calling illegals Americans. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=230.9s)]
*  One of the inmates currently in that prison is a Maryland man legally working here in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=235.34s)]
*  the United States, married to an American citizen with American children. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=240.54s)]
*  His name is Kilmar Obrego Garcia and he was kidnapped by ICE and rendered to the torture [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=244.5s)]
*  prison because what Trump's own lawyers have admitted was an administrative error. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=249.74s)]
*  Trump's folks are trying to whoops-a-daisy a human rights violation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=255.78s)]
*  It's like when Hitler came out with, mind bad. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=260.94s)]
*  Democrats are really going to bat for MS-13. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  First Tesla terrorists, then China, then Syrian immigrants who hate Jews, and now MS-13. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=267.66s)]
*  Now if you're MS-13, you're just trying to live the American dream. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=273.38s)]
*  We've been following the case of Kilmar Obrego Garcia, undocumented migrant from El Salvador, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  married an American woman, has a kid, living the American dream. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=283.54s)]
*  Until the Trump administration sent him to an El Salvadorian mega prison. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=290.3s)]
*  What is the American dream? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Kilmar breaks into the country, gets pulled over all the time, skips every hearing, associates [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  with high-ranking gangsters, gets his whole arm tatted up, gets an American woman pregnant, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=301.42s)]
*  doesn't propose, only marries her after he gets arrested because his lawyers say it would [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=306.7s)]
*  look better to have roots in the community. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=311.9s)]
*  A judge holds him and says he's a flight risk and a danger to the community. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  And a confidential informant tells the cops, the gang unit, that he's MS-13. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  And then a second judge upholds that he's MS-13. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  But CNN says he's just a Bulls fan. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=329.06s)]
*  According to court documents, Garcia and three other men were arrested in 2019. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=332.62s)]
*  He was asked if he was a gang member. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=337.26s)]
*  He said no. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=338.7s)]
*  Garcia had been deemed a gang member by the Prince George's County Police Department in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=339.7s)]
*  part because he was at the time wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=343.58s)]
*  Garcia's a Bulls fan, but he's from El Salvador and he lives in Maryland, not Chicago. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=348.26s)]
*  The Bulls lost 60 games in 2019, so why the hat? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=355.18s)]
*  Can Garcia name anyone on the team? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=359.42s)]
*  Anyone on any Bulls team besides Jordan? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=361.78s)]
*  Everyone from El Salvador knows what it means when you wear a Bulls hat. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=365.38s)]
*  It means you're MS-13. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=368.62s)]
*  When you're in Compton, you don't accidentally wear red and say, oh, I didn't know red was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=371.08s)]
*  blood. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=375.78s)]
*  If you're a Latin American illegal alien in Maryland, you don't accidentally wear Chicago [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=377.38s)]
*  Bulls gear and hang around with high ranking gangsters from MS-13. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=381.08s)]
*  This is the reason he had to break into the country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=386.58s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=388.98s)]
*  A local gang in El Salvador was shaking down his grandma's tortilla shop, and his lawyers [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=390.7s)]
*  say if he gets sent back to El Salvador, he's a dead man. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  It's a tortilla blood vendetta. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=400.86s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  So who are Garcia's attorneys who manage to get their client a hearing in the Supreme [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=404.94s)]
*  Court? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=408.38s)]
*  Trump's supporting tens of thousands of illegals, and this is the only case that's gone this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=409.7s)]
*  far. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=413.78s)]
*  These lawyers must be good. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=416.9s)]
*  Well, they are good. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=417.9s)]
*  They're the best lawyers dirty money can buy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=419.38s)]
*  The firms repped gang members like Aaron Hernandez and Bobby Schmurda. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=422.14s)]
*  Aaron Hernandez was Bloods. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=427.1s)]
*  Bobby Schmurda was GS9 out of Brooklyn. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=429.02s)]
*  The firm also represented members of the Rosenthal Hidalgo family, traffickers in business with [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=432.14s)]
*  the cartels. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=438.02s)]
*  And these well-paid defense attorneys took the Garcia case. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=440.02s)]
*  But he's definitely not MS-13. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=443.62s)]
*  These lawyers are really making him into an innocent Maryland dad in the media, and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=447.16s)]
*  the media is drinking the Kool-Aid. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=450.8s)]
*  He's an illegal immigrant. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=453.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=454.68s)]
*  He was here illegally with deportation orders in 2019. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=455.68s)]

*  Is there any scenario under which this guy- [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=468.3s)]
*  He did not. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=470.08000000000004s)]

*  He was an illegal alien in this country with a deportation order in 2019. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=475.08s)]

*  it's appalling, truly appalling, that there has been so much time covering this alleged [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=496.12s)]
*  immigrant trafficker and this gang member, MS-13 gang member. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=503.68s)]
*  It's truly striking to me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=509.68s)]
*  Democrats just lost in a landslide because they let illegal gang bangers into the country, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=511.96s)]

*  Chris, you're really serious about this because maybe maybe he can move in with you. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=920.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=925.44s)]
*  Well, I don't even know if we announced this, but I am planning tomorrow to go to El Salvador [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=926.44s)]
*  to work to bring to work to bring him home. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=930.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=942.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=949.48s)]
*  I heard that, but I didn't know that was public. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=952.48s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=959.48s)]
*  Bring them all home. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=964.36s)]
*  All the bring all the illegals from El Salvador home. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=965.36s)]
*  Doesn't matter if they're gang members or not. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=967.84s)]
*  We'll find out how Rachel Warren's mother feels about this. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=969.72s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a party filled, filled of lunatics and who seem to value the comfort of an illegal [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=973.88s)]
*  immigrant over you, law abiding peaceful American citizens. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=980.64s)]
*  And let's be very clear about something. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  This illegal immigrant in question is not a Maryland man. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=987.0s)]
*  That is misinformation. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=990.2s)]
*  That is fake news currently spreading like wildfire in the legacy media mob. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=991.8000000000001s)]
*  According to the White House, this is a gang member who is most definitely not from Maryland [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=996.7199999999999s)]
*  and he does not have a right to be in Maryland or anywhere else in this country. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  He is a citizen of El Salvador and is currently in his home country. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1007.12s)]
*  Thanks to Donald Trump and his administration. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1011.8s)]
*  And now in other news, Barack Obama, he's busy with another cause. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1014.28s)]
*  He's now rushing to the defense of Harvard University. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1017.68s)]
*  Trump is very deeply troubled that Harvard may not receive their usual multi-billion [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1021.36s)]
*  dollar payout with your money from the federal government after rejecting Donald Trump's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1027.0s)]
*  federal mandate that requires universities to eliminate DEI, reject anti-Semitism on [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1032.2s)]
*  college campuses. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1038.44s)]
*  The administration froze $2.2 billion in your tax dollars. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1039.9s)]
*  So my question tonight, why is Harvard receiving any of your hard earned tax dollars? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1044.3600000000001s)]
*  We have $37 trillion in debt. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1050.56s)]
*  You know, the school has the largest institutional endowment in the country. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1052.96s)]
*  They have a whopping $53 billion stashed away. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1057.56s)]
*  It costs nearly $80,000 a year to attend this private prestigious university. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1061.6s)]
*  So why is the federal government giving them a penny? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1067.6799999999998s)]
*  And with bullets flying in Obama's hometown of Chicago, why is this his cause celeb? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1071.3999999999999s)]
*  Why is this so important to him? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1076.84s)]
*  This is a party of woke elites for woke elites. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1078.84s)]
*  Now they're simply not concerned with serious issues that impact most Americans. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  That is why their approval numbers are lower than they've ever been. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1086.72s)]
*  Even in the deep blue state of California, Kamala Harris is now struggling to get political [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1090.4399999999998s)]
*  traction ahead of a possible run for governor. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1095.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, breaking tonight, more troubling news for Democrats. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1098.32s)]
*  According to a report from John Solomon and other news sources, the left's one-time big [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1101.24s)]
*  savior is in legal trouble. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1107.24s)]
*  The left's one-time, yep, the head of legal trouble. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1109.4s)]
*  Anyway, a criminal referral has been issued from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1113.5600000000002s)]
*  has been filed against New York Attorney General Letitia James. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  Now based on this reporting, James is accused of falsifying records to receive more favorable [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1122.2s)]
*  loan terms. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1128.0400000000002s)]
*  John Solomon will have a full report coming up later in the show. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1129.0800000000002s)]
*  And tonight, the bad news for Democrats does not stop there. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1131.72s)]
*  After enjoying quite a bit of rest and relaxation after leaving office, Joe Biden is out of [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1135.48s)]
*  hibernation and he's speaking in public. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1141.5600000000002s)]
*  Let's just say that today's speech did not go very well. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1147.64s)]
*  It's about dignity, simple dignity. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1149.48s)]
*  Everyone, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, regardless of the standard, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1153.88s)]
*  regardless of the economic system, regardless of who they are. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1160.2s)]
*  Fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much, done so much damage and [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1163.48s)]
*  so much destruction. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1171.8799999999999s)]
*  It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1173.8s)]
*  They've taken a hatchet into the Social Security Administration, pushing an additional 7,000 [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1177.24s)]
*  employees, 7,000 out the door in that time. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1183.08s)]
*  We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1187.4s)]
*  Like I said, I've been doing this a long time. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1192.84s)]
*  It's never been this divided. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1195.8799999999999s)]
*  Granted, it's roughly 30 percent, but it's a 30 percent that has no heart. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1200.6s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1206.44s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1207.32s)]
*  He's back. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1208.04s)]
*  Low energy Joe. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1208.76s)]
*  Anyway, sleepy Joe. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1209.72s)]
*  At one point, Joe actually referred to African Americans, well, using this term. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1211.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1216.68s)]
*  And I had never seen hardly any black people in Scranton at the time. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1218.14s)]
*  And I was only going on fourth grade. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1224.14s)]
*  And I remember seeing the kids going by at the time called colored kids on a bus going by. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1227.3400000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1233.18s)]
*  The Democratic Party is not in a good place. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1233.5s)]
*  That's the same guy, by the way, that partnered with the former Klansman. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1235.5800000000002s)]
*  For the very purpose of stopping the integration of public schools and busing, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1239.1000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris even one time called them out on it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1243.98s)]
*  But for some reason, they're totally opposed to any new leadership. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1247.1000000000001s)]
*  For example, a recent poll showing our friend Stephen A. Smith will join us in a second [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1250.6200000000001s)]
*  with little chance of winning a Democratic primary in 2028. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1255.02s)]
*  I am far more suspicious of this poll than probably most people. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1259.66s)]
*  But the message I will tell you is clear. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1263.74s)]
*  If you don't tell that radical left wing, hardcore line Democrats, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1265.9s)]
*  in the end, they will try to utterly destroy anybody. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1270.06s)]
*  If they jump into this race, they will be the people that decide who the candidates are going [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1273.6599999999999s)]
*  to be. And Stephen A. Smith over the weekend said that he has no choice but to have to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1278.06s)]
*  leave open the door and consider a possible run. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1287.1799999999998s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren was just on with you. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1289.1799999999998s)]
*  You're going to have a multitude of Democratic representatives on with you. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1290.94s)]
*  They talk and they talk and they talk. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1294.62s)]
*  But what can they do? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1296.1399999999999s)]
*  They position themselves to do absolutely nothing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1297.26s)]
*  They talked about everything from woke culture, the cancer culture, to abortion rights and all [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1299.58s)]
*  of this other stuff. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1303.5s)]
*  So that wasn't going to win the election. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1304.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's what we have to look at. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1306.54s)]
*  What is it? What is it going to take to get the job done? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1307.82s)]
*  That's why somebody who's a sports analyst for crying out loud is in the daggone polls. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1310.9399999999998s)]
*  Are you really thinking about running for president? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1315.4199999999998s)]
*  Is this something you think? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1317.26s)]
*  Listen, I've been I have no choice because I've had elected officials and I'm not going [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1318.3799999999999s)]
*  to give their names. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1323.82s)]
*  Elected officials coming up to me. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1324.62s)]
*  I've had folks who are pundits come up to me. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1326.46s)]
*  I've had folks that got a lot of money, billionaires and others that have talked to me about exploratory [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1329.02s)]
*  committees and things of that nature. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1334.94s)]
*  I'm not a politician. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1336.3s)]
*  I've never had a desire to be a politician. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1337.34s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1347.42s)]
*  Somebody's getting the second base after the show. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1350.7s)]
*  Hope it's me. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1354.7s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1356.22s)]
*  So today is tax day or as Hunter Biden calls it any other day of the week. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1357.26s)]
*  To pay tribute to the California Gold Rush, a minor league baseball team decided to name [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1363.74s)]
*  themselves the Gold Diggers, but scrapped it after people claimed the name was sexist [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1368.7s)]
*  and demeaning. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1374.3799999999999s)]
*  So from now on, they will call themselves money grubbing whores. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1375.66s)]
*  An MSNBC analyst claimed that Donald Trump wants to take anyone in America and disappear [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1378.8600000000001s)]
*  them, presumably by booking them as an analyst on MSNBC. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1385.9s)]
*  Blue Origin's rocket successfully completed its mission with an all female crew. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1395.66s)]
*  The rocket was able to land safely after deploying both of Lauren Sanchez's breast implants. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1400.78s)]

*  They would have had another one sooner, but that's how long it took for them to get ready. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1418.54s)]
*  Chicks. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1423.5800000000002s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1425.42s)]
*  Slow. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1427.02s)]
*  Blue Origin astronaut Gail King enjoyed the flight, saying the ride was as smooth as when [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1428.22s)]
*  she's sitting on Oprah's face. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1433.1000000000001s)]
*  It's the name of her private jet. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1435.02s)]
*  Face. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1438.06s)]
*  Disgusting people. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1439.98s)]
*  Katy Perry sang What a Wonderful World during the space flight. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1442.38s)]
*  And for 11 minutes it was, because she wasn't there. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1445.58s)]
*  A 5.2 magnitude quake shook Southern California. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1451.18s)]
*  In fact, their tremors were so strong, a crack was found in Nancy Pelosi's face. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1454.3s)]
*  But during the quake, the elephants at the San Diego Zoo formed an alert circle to protect their young. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1458.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1465.3400000000001s)]
*  Similar behavior can be seen among other large land mammals in distress. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1466.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1471.26s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1474.14s)]
*  So, people have all sorts of opinions about the Trump tariffs. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1475.1000000000001s)]
*  Some say they're going to restore the economy. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1479.9s)]
*  Some say they're going to stop the economy. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1482.22s)]
*  Still others say, what's a tariff? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1484.22s)]
*  But I just heard a new one about these tariffs. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1490.22s)]
*  It's from the Kentucky Turbys very own Nicole Wallace. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1492.78s)]
*  I wonder if she spent nine months having to learn about the power of the Manosphere. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1498.46s)]
*  I spent nine months in the space. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1504.3s)]
*  I spent nine months in the space. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1507.9s)]
*  The Manosphere. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1509.9s)]
*  I spent nine months having to learn about the power of the Manosphere. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1511.74s)]
*  Seeing Donald Trump sit with all sorts of podcasters and bloggers and people younger and hipper than me, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1516.8600000000001s)]
*  having to explain to me who they are and why they matter. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1522.8600000000001s)]
*  But in consuming some of their content, a lot of conversations were pretty shallow ones about masculinity [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1524.8600000000001s)]
*  and what it meant to be emasculated. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1531.42s)]
*  There is nothing more emasculating than losing your buying power. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1533.8200000000002s)]
*  Thank you lady who was too insufferable for the view. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1537.98s)]
*  I got a hand in to her. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1542.3s)]
*  She's working hard at creating a new phantom scare. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1543.26s)]
*  And now it's the Manosphere, which apparently means dudes who talk to other dudes on the internet. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1546.62s)]
*  It's not a giant sphere made of men. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1552.3s)]
*  If it was, Don Lemon would be sitting on it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1554.62s)]
*  So why did Nicole have to spend nine months learning about dudes? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1559.82s)]
*  Well, she didn't. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1564.06s)]
*  Because other than Jeffrey Toobin whacking off, no one in cable news spends nine minutes on anything. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1565.26s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1574.46s)]
*  But because the left has lost the battle on real issues, it's easier to imagine a problem. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1576.06s)]
*  Which means it's time for... [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1581.18s)]
*  You're entering another dimension. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1584.22s)]
*  Not only of sight and sound, but of mind. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1586.46s)]
*  Next stop, Greg's Department of Imaginary Concerns. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1589.82s)]
*  Yes, it's time for Greg's Dick. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1595.82s)]
*  The Department of Imaginary Concerns. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1601.18s)]
*  It's the same department that brought you Russian collusion, the climate apocalypse, trans kids, plastic straws. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1603.58s)]
*  And now add the effects of tariffs on the Manosphere. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1609.5s)]
*  It's the lefty way of condemning tariffs while pretending to care about men. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1612.54s)]
*  Men who've already fled your party like waxers when Joy Behar comes in to get a Brazilian. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1616.94s)]
*  Keep going, Nicole. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1621.82s)]
*  Your sense of an ability to get ahead more than axing off your buying power. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1651.82s)]
*  And that is exactly what Trump, by himself, did this week. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1657.4199999999998s)]
*  Oh, so now she cares about men and about masculinity. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1661.58s)]
*  Masculinity, where the f*** has she been? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1667.6599999999999s)]
*  She says high prices emasculate men. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1671.5s)]
*  It's weird how she never said this when the prices were soaring under Biden. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1674.3799999999999s)]
*  But now she's concerned because dads can't buy sneakers made by slaves. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1678.3000000000002s)]
*  This argument can only be made by people so far up their own asses they fart eyelashes. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1683.02s)]
*  But there's no problem. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1689.66s)]
*  Lives can't make worse by thinking of another imaginary catastrophe. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1690.7s)]
*  And now it's the Manosphere. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  This week, Vox ran a whole piece on male podcasters grappling with tariffs. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1696.38s)]
*  At CNN, some pudgy reporter did an entire investigation of the so-called Manosphere. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1701.1000000000001s)]
*  And the cretins at the conversation offered advice on what parents need to know [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1706.22s)]
*  to talk to their children. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1710.3s)]
*  Talk to their children about the Manosphere. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1712.38s)]
*  They make it sound like it's a stranger handing out candy from a van labeled Vox and Friends. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1715.1000000000001s)]
*  But is the Manosphere really the problem? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  Here's a wonderful exchange before the all-female Blue Origin flight to space. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1727.18s)]
*  But remember, it wasn't just six women. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1732.14s)]
*  They thought it was just six women going up into space for a joyride. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1734.3s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean just six women? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1738.7s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1740.3s)]
*  That was the criticism. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1741.18s)]
*  Explain to our audience why even a trip like this one, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1743.1s)]
*  all the trips that we take in this space benefit mankind. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1747.34s)]
*  So it benefits humankind. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1751.6599999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to keep correcting the mankind and the man-made and the man missions. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1753.4199999999998s)]
*  Because this is exactly what this mission is about. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1758.54s)]
*  Is expanding the perspective of who does space. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1761.74s)]
*  I love that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1767.8200000000002s)]
*  We're no longer exploring outer space. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1769.1000000000001s)]
*  We're doing space. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1771.5s)]
*  Like it's hot yoga. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1774.5400000000002s)]
*  Or Pilates in the park in a diamond-encrusted thong. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1776.38s)]
*  What did that chafe? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1780.3000000000002s)]
*  But I guess we should ditch every word with man in it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1782.22s)]
*  No more mango, manhole, manhandle, manhunt, mantle, manatee. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1784.78s)]
*  But what about manosphere? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1791.66s)]
*  Take that away, then how will we bash Trump? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1793.18s)]
*  It's funny, for every so-called moment of progress, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1796.46s)]
*  we end up compelled to narrow our own world to follow the rules [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1799.3400000000001s)]
*  of those entitled enough to participate in the progress. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1802.8600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to keep up. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1806.3000000000002s)]
*  Men, well, they suck until we need them to bash Trump policies. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1807.8200000000002s)]
*  Women, well, any dude can be one with a little eyeliner. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1811.9s)]
*  Until they do space, then they better be real women and rich too. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1816.14s)]
*  And hold on, no trans in space? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1821.8200000000002s)]
*  Where's the inclusion? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1825.42s)]
*  Doesn't ET stand for extra testicles? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1827.1000000000001s)]
*  But this is the Democrat Party, a department of imaginary concerns, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1833.02s)]
*  vying for attention but signifying nothing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1836.6200000000001s)]
*  And as long as Trump keeps at it, this dick can only keep growing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1839.02s)]
*  Yes, here he is. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1844.3000000000002s)]
*  Let's welcome, can I guess? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1845.98s)]
*  Yes, he wasn't Joker 2, but we booked him anyway, comedian Tim Dillard. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  He's known for his style and his million-dollar smile. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1857.02s)]
*  Host of Making Money on Fox Business, Charles Payne. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1860.3s)]
*  She's covered more athletes than Ben Gay. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1866.06s)]
*  Host of the Michelle Tafoya Podcast, Michelle Tafoya. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1868.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1871.34s)]
*  And like their teeth, old ladies like to take him out at night. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1875.26s)]
*  New York Times best selling author, comedian, former interviewer, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1882.06s)]
*  New York Times' best selling author, comedian, former interviewer, Tim. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1884.06s)]
*  Tim, I'm so excited that you're here. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1887.26s)]
*  You have the best podcast on the planet. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1890.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, that's for a nice view. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1892.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, it is. It is. It's fantastic. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1894.1399999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1896.3799999999999s)]
*  So after I shower you with praise, you have a special tonight that, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1897.02s)]
*  well, it comes out today. Everybody should watch it on Netflix when the show ends. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1900.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1906.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1906.6999999999998s)]
*  It's called Humankind. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1907.1799999999998s)]
*  And it's about humans. No, it's called I'm Your Mother, which I can be. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1911.82s)]
*  And it's on Netflix, so thank you. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1917.9799999999998s)]
*  Awesome. So are you part of the Manosphere? What did you make of that? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1920.3s)]
*  What do you make of the media in general trying to tackle issues like tariffs? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1924.3s)]
*  It's funny to... The Manosphere is just a funny... It's a funny idea because it's this idea that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1928.38s)]
*  the people... You run a very unpopular candidate on a platform that Americans reject [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1935.5800000000002s)]
*  and then go, it's actually four guys who have podcasts. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1940.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1944.7800000000002s)]

*  Yeah, they can't admit that actually the voters rejected them. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1949.66s)]
*  Yeah, like they said to me, they go, do you guys think you're the new establishment? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1953.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what about Harvard? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1956.38s)]
*  You know, like what? The new establishment. Half of these people, we work like an hour a day. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1958.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1965.42s)]

*  So I don't know. I don't know if it's a... Yeah, I don't know if it's a really powerful group of people. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=1972.7800000000002s)]

*  Yeah, it's just so funny. She spent nine months studying this. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2034.78s)]
*  And she learned nothing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2040.8600000000001s)]
*  She essentially sounds like she described a 40-year-old man, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2042.78s)]
*  not these young men who put Trump over the top. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2046.94s)]
*  She should just go to a couple of UFC fights. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2049.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2052.22s)]
*  If she wants to learn about this group of people. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2052.46s)]
*  If you really want to learn, go there and stop hanging out with these men who are getting [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2054.62s)]
*  waxing jobs and stuff like that because she's talking to the wrong dudes. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2059.34s)]
*  The only guy she's around is Chris Hayes. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2063.66s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2065.34s)]
*  There you go. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2066.3s)]
*  Yeah. And we're not even sure, you know. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2067.02s)]
*  I mean, I haven't checked out. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2070.46s)]
*  But the funniness of it though is really disingenuous part of it is what gets me. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2071.34s)]
*  It's like you don't care about these people. You know nothing about them. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2075.5s)]
*  And you're grappling. You're just grappling. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2078.86s)]
*  And so please stop, you know, with the crocodile tears. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2081.02s)]
*  Michelle, she mansplained the Manosphere. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2084.06s)]
*  She sure did. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2088.06s)]
*  You mentioned that there was this article put out by The Conversation [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  about how to talk to your kids about the Manosphere. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2093.6600000000003s)]
*  I want to tell you who wrote that. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2097.9s)]
*  Who did? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2099.6600000000003s)]
*  Her name is Annabelle. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2100.54s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce her last name, but here's who she is. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2101.74s)]
*  I hate her already. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2104.14s)]
*  She's a PhD student in gender-based political violence at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2106.7s)]
*  That's who's... [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2115.58s)]
*  So she's... [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2116.22s)]
*  She's a b****** artist. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2116.7s)]
*  She's like 23. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2118.38s)]
*  And she's going to tell parents how to deal with the Manosphere. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2121.1s)]
*  I just love all these kids in their bedrooms. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2124.7799999999997s)]
*  They're high. They smell like weed. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2126.86s)]
*  And the parent's like, I got to talk to you. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2129.66s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2131.02s)]
*  And they're like, have you heard a podcast? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2132.14s)]
*  You're like, thank God. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2133.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2134.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2135.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2135.66s)]
*  I thought they found that. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2135.8999999999996s)]
*  You know? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2137.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, thank God. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2137.8199999999997s)]
*  The other, the flip side of this is that these people like Nicole Wallace are so quick to... [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2139.8199999999997s)]
*  First of all, they hate these men in the Manosphere. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2145.74s)]
*  But now they want to use them to say, you don't like the tariffs in the Manosphere. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2149.98s)]
*  So you probably won't vote for Trump next time. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2154.54s)]
*  But they, you know what they overlook? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2157.18s)]
*  Toxic femininity, which is defined, Greg, by Emotional Intelligence magazine [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2159.1s)]
*  as villainizing all men as oppressors, dismissing or mocking issues affecting men, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2165.1s)]
*  and promoting female superiority rather than true equality. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2170.46s)]
*  And you can sense it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2175.2599999999998s)]
*  That's probably why the Manosphere is. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2176.46s)]
*  Because women like Nicole... [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2179.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2181.1s)]
*  So basically you're talking about outnumbered. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2181.3399999999997s)]
*  There was another word I was going to use for that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2183.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2185.74s)]
*  You know, Tyrus, I keep hearing the phrase Manosphere, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2186.22s)]
*  and I feel like it's a bar you and I should go in on. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2189.2599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2191.42s)]
*  Downtown, Manosphere. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2191.98s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2193.18s)]
*  When I was in college, me and my buddy wanted to make a bar called Atmosphere. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2193.98s)]
*  And it didn't work either. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2197.98s)]
*  This is the worst attempt. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2201.42s)]
*  Instead of looking in the mirror, they got their ass kicked. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2204.22s)]
*  And so they're blaming Trump for that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2208.46s)]
*  And so they're blaming podcasts for it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2211.34s)]
*  So they go to the old woke playbook and they're like, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2214.38s)]
*  what are... [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2216.78s)]
*  Go to page two. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2217.42s)]
*  Men's fault. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2219.6600000000003s)]
*  White men in particular. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2220.78s)]
*  But we need a catchy phrase to bring everybody together. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2222.6200000000003s)]
*  And this is where the woke up all the time. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2225.5800000000004s)]
*  They don't have anybody creative on their team to come up with a cool nickname. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2228.38s)]
*  Manosphere? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2233.34s)]
*  You can't even say like, I'm in the Manosphere. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2234.46s)]
*  No one wants to say that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2236.94s)]
*  No one's going to get a t-shirt that says Manosphere. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2238.3s)]
*  Even in weightlifting terms, you wouldn't say I'm the Manosphere of the year. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2241.82s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2245.5s)]
*  They need a marketing team. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2246.94s)]
*  Actually, what they need to do is they need to actually listen to the podcast because [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2249.98s)]
*  most of us, to your point, Smoke Weed, and also we just do it as an excuse to speak to our buddies [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2254.2200000000003s)]
*  and pretend like we're talking about world issues. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2260.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's just us, just guys being guys. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2263.5s)]
*  She doesn't know that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2266.2200000000003s)]
*  This is another pathetic attempt to try to blame white men for getting their ass kicked [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2267.18s)]
*  in the election instead of just saying, hey guys, we need to be better. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2272.7s)]
*  It's, hey, it's Manosphere. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2276.2999999999997s)]

*  No one's using that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2279.74s)]
*  Manosphere is no Greg's dick. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r67ZK-vSnXU&t=2281.8999999999996s)]
