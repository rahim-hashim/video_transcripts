# Fox News Highlights - June 18th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y)
*  Look, for President Trump, every day is Flag Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The bigger the American flag, the taller the flagpole, the better. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=6.12s)]
*  I've always said, why doesn't have a flagpole? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=10.84s)]
*  This is about the largest you'll ever see. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=13.44s)]
*  That'll be very nice, very patriotic. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=17.32s)]
*  This type of unapologetic, unbridled patriotism drives today's Democrats to the brink. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=24.12s)]
*  The perpetually whiny publication known as The Daily Beast called the flagpoles a monstrous [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=32.0s)]
*  and tacky change. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=37.56s)]
*  More on that later. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Of course, there are flags that the left pledges allegiance to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Like this one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=45.22s)]
*  And this one. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=47.78s)]
*  Desecrate either at your own peril. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Yet Trump's broad coalition rejects this and favors his America First approach. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=53.6s)]
*  He wasn't and isn't like all of his Republican predecessors, thank goodness. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=58.96s)]
*  Both on economic and foreign policy, he's bold, but he's realistic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=64.4s)]
*  And he's been consistent on Iran not having nukes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=69.36s)]
*  Is there anybody here that said it would be okay to have a hostile country have a nuclear [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=72.64s)]
*  weapon that could destroy 25 miles, but much more than that? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=76.64s)]
*  And right now, we're all holding our breath, wondering whether America will strike Iran [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=82.64s)]
*  with a bunker buster and what will come next. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=108.0s)]
*  What does a wider war look like? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  After all, when you start a military engagement, you don't necessarily know what's going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  come up or how it's going to end. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  Are our military bases vulnerable? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=120.56s)]
*  And what are the risks of doing nothing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  Could be big. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Then some of you wonder if Trump is getting talked into this by the same voices that have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  misled us before. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=132.52s)]
*  Politico is reporting that one pro-intervention general has a lot of influence at the Pentagon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  U.S. CENTCOM Chief General Eric Carilla and how others are more skeptical of our getting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=140.56s)]
*  involved and that those voices are getting edged out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=146.88s)]
*  And notwithstanding the fight on the right, the angle believes we need to stay grounded [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=151.44s)]
*  in the America first principles. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  What are they? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, number one, we cannot succeed in war, any war, unless our people are on board. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  Remember, we didn't lose in Iraq and Afghanistan because the soldiers were beaten in battle. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=167.52s)]
*  We lost because Americans at home saw no path to victory. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=172.08s)]
*  We got Obama. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=176.24s)]
*  And right now, Trump knows there is very strong popular support for a narrow objective. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Oppose Iran getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=184.84s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=186.08s)]
*  79% of adults agree on that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=187.4s)]
*  They agree with Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  83% of Republicans, 79% of independents, 79% of Democrats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=191.68s)]
*  When you get 79% of Democrats and 83% of Republicans agreeing on anything, you know [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=196.68s)]
*  that that position is the very clear majority in this country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=201.44s)]
*  And so the American public is with Donald Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=204.72s)]
*  But Americans will not support any war that appears to be endless. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=208.36s)]
*  There must be a clear goal and the war must end once that goal is achieved. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=214.8s)]
*  I was remembering back today, I was flying back from England today, and I remember back [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=220.32s)]
*  in 2016 at the RNC, I was there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=224.2s)]
*  Then candidate Trump laid waste to his predecessors who got it all wrong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=227.48s)]
*  After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=239.5s)]
*  We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=246.84s)]
*  We must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=254.82s)]
*  Islamic terrorism. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=263.26s)]
*  This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=265.68s)]
*  Well, he was right then and can't imagine he feels any differently now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=274.44s)]
*  He's still putting out an olive branch to Iran, even tonight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=278.68s)]
*  Every president that has overseen a war without a clear victory, going back to President Truman [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=283.08s)]
*  in Korea, has paid a major political cost. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=287.56s)]
*  That is just the truth. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=291.86s)]
*  Third, Americans are not going to support a war that hurts the economy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=293.64s)]
*  Again, Trump has always known this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=297.56s)]
*  We have spent more than seven trillion dollars in fighting wars in the Middle East. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=300.56s)]
*  As a candidate for president, I loudly pledged a new approach. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=308.96s)]
*  Great nations do not fight endless wars. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=317.16s)]
*  Hello, my Nancy Pelosi wasn't clapping. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=321.36s)]
*  Well, that came along. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=328.0s)]
*  Look, we're already in a major financial hole now because of the trillions we lost [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=330.2s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=334.4s)]
*  Thus, any action in Iran must not do serious damage to the federal budget, provoke inflation, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=336.16s)]
*  or drive up interest rates. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=343.36s)]
*  That all would be a nightmare for Trump and for the country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=345.24s)]
*  Number four, Americans are not going to support a war that weakens our position in the rest [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=348.84s)]
*  of the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=353.44s)]
*  So if a military action in the Middle East means that we are effectively ceding more [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=354.96s)]
*  of Asia to the CCP, that war will not be seen as a success. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=359.16s)]
*  Thus, any military action should meet the following criteria. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  You got to have a clear goal. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=369.68s)]
*  That goal must be militarily achievable without damage to the U.S. economy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=371.64s)]
*  That goal must be consistent with our overall policies, including our ability to stand up [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=377.28s)]
*  to the CCP. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=381.8s)]
*  That goal must be clearly articulated to the American people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=383.78s)]
*  Now when that goal is achieved, the war must end. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  The end of the war must also be clearly articulated to the American people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  None of the vague mission accomplished nonsense that leads to 15 more years of fighting. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  So when the war is over, the troops and the weapons come home and we celebrate, period. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  So if we have a plan that can meet those criteria, we can succeed. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=409.62s)]
*  Any plan that does not meet these criteria will fail, no matter how much we want it to work. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=415.16s)]
*  Hoping and praying and wanting are not the same as winning. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=421.54s)]
*  Good intentions are not the same as good outcomes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=426.98s)]
*  So if you take America into war, into military conflict, then she better win. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=430.46s)]
*  And if she doesn't, the fact that you tried hard or had good intentions will not save [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=436.94s)]
*  you or your party politically. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=442.82s)]
*  So God bless President Trump and God bless our troops tonight. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=444.94s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=449.92s)]
*  Fox News alert, the Ayatollah has gone into hiding. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=450.92s)]
*  He's believed to be holed up inside an underground bunker northeast of the Capitol. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=454.18s)]
*  This is a different kind of Iranian hostage crisis. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=458.76s)]
*  Khomeini can hide, but he can't run. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=461.74s)]
*  For the past 24 hours, Israel's been attacking the area around his underground lair. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=464.5s)]
*  But Khomeini, still talking tough, says Iran will not surrender to anyone. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=469.72s)]
*  And is warning that if America joins the fight and strikes, it'll result in irreparable damage [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=475.94s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=481.28s)]
*  Is he bluffing? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=483.02s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=484.34s)]
*  Iranian proxies, which have been severely degraded, are threatening to commit acts of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=485.34s)]
*  terror against American troops and American ships in the region. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=490.2s)]
*  And American businesses are now bracing for cyber attacks. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=494.78s)]
*  Trump says, good luck with that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  We won't be bullied. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=500.44s)]
*  I was the hunted and now I'm the hunter. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=502.64s)]

*  They were bullies. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=525.72s)]
*  They were schoolyard bullies. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=528.48s)]

*  their new program peacefully. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=636.48s)]

*  I believe that unless Iran surrenders in the next 48 hours, the United States, in conjunction [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=644.84s)]

*  Again, you know what the victory is. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=670.76s)]
*  No nuclear weapon. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=673.4799999999999s)]

*  Iran's nuclear program is gone. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  The person who ultimately decides that is the Ayatollah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=680.76s)]

*  But either way, the outcome of this war is this. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=689.08s)]
*  The Iranians will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=691.6s)]
*  Ever. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=694.88s)]
*  But time's running out for both sides. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=696.08s)]
*  Israel's reportedly running low on defensive interceptors and Iran's reportedly running [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=698.6s)]
*  low on missiles. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=703.24s)]
*  Iran's also running out of allies. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=705.08s)]
*  They don't have any friends left in the region and China, their biggest customer, quiet. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=707.36s)]
*  And Putin, he has his own problems. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=713.02s)]
*  I spoke to him yesterday and I said, you know, he actually offered to help mediate. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=716.22s)]
*  I said, do me a favor, mediate your own. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=720.42s)]
*  Let's mediate Russia first. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=723.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=724.66s)]
*  I said, Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=725.66s)]
*  You can worry about this later. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=728.3s)]
*  The Persians are pinned up against the wall. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=730.38s)]
*  They've been completely humiliated by a tiny Jewish nation, a fraction of the size of Iran. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=732.54s)]
*  And now The Daily Wire is reporting that the Mossad set up a fake hotline in Iran and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=738.78s)]
*  ordered top Iranian military officials into an emergency meeting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=744.5799999999999s)]
*  And the generals were lured into a small bunker in Tehran before Israel wiped them out with [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=748.42s)]
*  a precision airstrike. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=754.26s)]
*  And inside of the country, you're starting to see unrest. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=756.5s)]
*  Sanctions have crippled their economy so badly that workers are rioting over delayed payments. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=760.26s)]
*  Workers are striking over high inflation. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=766.54s)]
*  Schools, cement factories, and pharmaceutical plants are shutting down. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=769.18s)]
*  The Iranian currency is getting shredded. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=773.9399999999999s)]
*  And Israel's hitting Iranian energy infrastructure, which is going to create price shocks and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=777.2199999999999s)]
*  shortages. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=782.14s)]
*  So with the streets teetering and its military commanders assassinated, a nuke might be the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=783.14s)]
*  Ayatollah's only hope. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=789.06s)]

*  But Trump says they're only a few weeks away. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=796.98s)]
*  Back in March, Tulsi Gabbard said the Iranians were enriching uranium at record levels. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=800.9000000000001s)]
*  In the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=807.2s)]
*  nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=811.2s)]
*  making apparatus. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=816.7600000000001s)]
*  Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=819.0s)]
*  state without nuclear weapons. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=824.12s)]
*  So will the United States end Iran's nuclear program with a 30,000 pound bunker buster? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=826.72s)]
*  Or can Israel end it themselves? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=832.8s)]
*  Israel admits they have options. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=835.52s)]
*  They could knock out the power plants that run the underground nuke facility. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=837.04s)]
*  And since they control the air, Israeli commandos could be inserted and fight their way in and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=841.36s)]
*  then detonate the site with dynamite. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=846.76s)]
*  If America does it, there would be consequences, nuclear contamination, and internationally [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=849.48s)]
*  there could be some fallout, although I'm sure Trump could handle it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=854.92s)]
*  Either way, the Iranians would retaliate and the United States would have to go back under [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=858.68s)]
*  a war footing in the Middle East. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=863.04s)]
*  The whole world's watching. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=865.66s)]

*  We're at this moment in history because of Obama and Biden. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=875.48s)]
*  They signed a toothless nuke deal that let the Iranians keep enriching and let them keep [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=879.08s)]
*  their ballistic missiles and paid them billions of dollars, which they used to finance their [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=884.12s)]
*  war machine and proxies, proxies which have been killing Americans for decades. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=888.84s)]

*  Same deterrence, backed by the threat of violence, is what maintains order in the world. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=901.64s)]

*  We're about to find out. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=918.56s)]
*  Right now as the Middle East boils over, everyone's asking the same question. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=920.72s)]
*  What do you call it when you raise a flagpole? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=926.92s)]
*  A lifting? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=929.64s)]
*  They call it a lifting. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=930.64s)]
*  They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that word. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=934.76s)]

*  But the other big question is, what does America first mean? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=948.08s)]
*  Does it mean cleaning up our yard before focusing on others? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=951.64s)]
*  Or is it about protecting us long term by turning Iran's nuke facilities into a giant [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=955.64s)]
*  kebab's are us? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=959.72s)]
*  So which way is Trump leaning? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=962.4s)]
*  At the very least, he's not like the last guy who would just fall over. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=964.12s)]
*  But Trump ran on America first and it means let's fix America first. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=968.76s)]
*  A lot of people will drink to that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=973.24s)]
*  Or in Kamala's case, it's a coincidence. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=975.38s)]
*  But it's pretty clear Trump's already fulfilling that mission. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  Look at the border, inflation, doze, bringing back industry, paring down regulations. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=984.06s)]
*  It's not like he just got in and said, first things first, let's bomb the goat loving mullahs [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=990.3399999999999s)]
*  out of Iran. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=995.0999999999999s)]
*  I think we can agree that even if Trump's looking at Iran, his first priority is America [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=997.06s)]
*  and he's weighing the options in the Middle East based on our interests first. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1001.5s)]
*  But right now, the right's tearing each other to shreds. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1005.4599999999999s)]
*  Because America first is now like Ozempic. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1009.3s)]
*  Everybody has their opinion and no one's going to shut up about it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1011.86s)]
*  Just stop eating. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1014.9s)]
*  True. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1016.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1017.58s)]
*  On one side, you got a crowd that says no more wars. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1018.58s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1022.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other team says if Iran gets nukes, guess who's target number two after [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1023.66s)]
*  Israel? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1027.9s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1028.9s)]
*  It ain't Scotland. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1029.9s)]
*  Too many sexy goats. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1031.82s)]
*  Yum yum. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1033.6200000000001s)]
*  Look at that one. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1035.7s)]
*  Of course, Iran would get annihilated with our nukes if they tried, but still, it's America's [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  toughest choice since whether or not to deport the beaver on Maxine Waters' head. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1043.94s)]
*  It's not just a war between Iran and Israel, you know. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1049.66s)]
*  It's a war between frames of reference. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1054.46s)]
*  You got one frame, which is we can't have another Holocaust and we can't let a country [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1057.38s)]
*  that wants to destroy us have nukes and we shouldn't let our ocean privilege hang an [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1061.26s)]
*  important ally out to dry. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1066.6599999999999s)]
*  Then there's this frame of reference. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1069.1399999999999s)]
*  We can't make the same damn mistakes again, like when we were lied to about WMDs or when [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1071.1399999999999s)]
*  we're told that we would be greeted as liberators. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1076.1799999999998s)]
*  We never are lately. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1078.76s)]
*  Plus we have Ukraine to deal with. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1081.1399999999999s)]
*  Whatever the outcome adjoining a war against Iran is, a lot of Trump voters will think, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1083.98s)]
*  I didn't vote for this. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1087.98s)]
*  The only good news is that our frame of references are no longer plagued with opinions assigned [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1089.86s)]
*  to us by legacy media. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1095.62s)]
*  They're irrelevant. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1097.7s)]
*  No one buys their s***. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1098.7s)]
*  Thanks to Trump's transparency and a vibrant independent media, it's just us trying to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1100.6599999999999s)]
*  figure this thing out. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1104.82s)]
*  We elected Trump to handle stuff from a Trumpian perspective. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1106.46s)]
*  So far he's doing that. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1110.26s)]
*  He told the Ayatollah the five best words to make anyone nervous. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1111.86s)]
*  I know where you live. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1116.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a great prank. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  I send that to Killmeat all the time from anonymous emailing. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1120.98s)]
*  All accounts. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1125.46s)]
*  He has to move hotels every week. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1129.14s)]
*  So Trump is doing Trump. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1133.78s)]
*  He's stingy with blood and treasure, looking to avoid an all out war so far. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1135.58s)]
*  But also, you know, he sees Israel differently. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1141.42s)]
*  To him, Israel earned it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1144.54s)]
*  They're doing the work instead of showing up with hat in hand. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1146.46s)]
*  And it's not like they're delusional. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1150.42s)]
*  Last time we checked, people do want them dead. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1151.9s)]
*  But unlike the rabid neocons of the past, Trump does wonder what comes next. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1154.6s)]
*  We do too. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1160.04s)]
*  So can we say what America first means now? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1161.12s)]
*  Do we protect our own by staying out or by stepping in before it's too late? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1164.12s)]
*  Maybe it's defending your allies without sacrificing your sons. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1169.12s)]
*  Meaning you only go in if we're going to win and win easily. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1172.7199999999998s)]
*  That feels very Trumpian to me. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1176.34s)]
*  In that the best war is the one that you win, you know, just by showing up for a friend. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1178.28s)]

*  Loftus, you know, if Trump or America strikes Iran, it may end up as a pile of rubble. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1231.8799999999999s)]
*  As someone who lives currently in similar conditions, do you empathize with Iran? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1238.52s)]
*  What side are you on? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1244.56s)]
*  I don't like to think of myself as a rubble dweller, as a mortgage deficient. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1247.12s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1252.8799999999999s)]

*  Because like Americans aren't going over. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1265.08s)]

*  Fire and cable television. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1293.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1299.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1300.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1304.28s)]
*  So I think you need to put up a few decades of like we have blockbuster video, you know, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1305.28s)]
*  show us that you can participate in polite society before you go for the top rung of [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1309.48s)]

*  bombing in, but we're not getting involved. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1319.76s)]

*  OK. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1322.52s)]
*  It's like we're letting Israel borrow our lawnmower. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1323.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1325.16s)]

*  So you know what? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1351.64s)]
*  Here's the Marjorie Taylor Greene posted this. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel-Iran war is not America [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1356.2800000000002s)]
*  first MAGA. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1364.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know America first meant America only. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think it does. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1369.0s)]
*  And by the way, Iran hates us, too. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1370.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1373.64s)]
*  At least the Ayatollah does. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1374.64s)]
*  He'd like to dispense with the big Satan just as much as the little Satan. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1375.64s)]
*  So this is not just Israel's war, in my opinion. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1378.62s)]
*  And by the way, as you mentioned, they have done a staggeringly good job, Israel, of going [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1382.34s)]
*  in and taking out all these pinpoint attacks and these targeted deaths. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1388.02s)]
*  It's been amazing. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1397.06s)]
*  So they've laid the groundwork. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1398.6999999999998s)]
*  It's not like we're going in and we're leading the way. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  Now they may need our bunker busters and I'm all for it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1403.02s)]
*  I really am. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1405.7399999999998s)]
*  And if we want to take out the Ayatollah, well, he's 89. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1406.96s)]
*  He's got to have much more time anyway. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1410.0s)]
*  I think that a lot, a lot, a big percentage of Iranians want their old life back. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1412.28s)]
*  They want to be part of the modern world. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1419.52s)]
*  And they are kind of with Israel on that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1423.04s)]
*  They have that in common. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1425.48s)]
*  None of them like the Ayatollah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1426.48s)]
*  They're just under the jackboots. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1428.48s)]
*  So I think we're on the precipice, Greg, of a world-changing moment. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1429.8s)]
*  And I think we should take it and grab it by the horns and go. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1436.12s)]
*  All right, Katz. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  I can feel Katz trying to pump the brakes. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  Pump the brakes, right? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1445.52s)]
*  That's what you're doing right now, huh, Katz? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1446.52s)]
*  My take is completely on the side of we stay out of it. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1448.6s)]
*  I don't see any reason for us to be involved. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1453.3999999999999s)]
*  And reasons that Iran is bad is not a reason for us to get involved or that things would [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1456.8s)]
*  even get better if we did get involved. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1462.9599999999998s)]
*  You look at Libya, you look at Afghanistan, you look at Iraq, you look at Syria. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1464.92s)]
*  Didn't go so well for us. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1469.52s)]
*  It's the same playbook. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  It's the same fear-mongering. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1472.1000000000001s)]
*  We're all going to die making people so afraid. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1473.92s)]
*  A lot of people are motivated by fear in calling for this. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1475.76s)]
*  Some people are motivated by money in calling for this. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1479.3400000000001s)]
*  Many of the people calling for this will not have to go over themselves if it does [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1483.18s)]
*  end up in a boots on the ground situation, which is something that I am concerned about. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1487.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't want any one son to have to go die for another country's war, including my own, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1491.56s)]
*  even though he's only four months old. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1496.3999999999999s)]
*  Based on our history in this region, it could very much still be a concern by the time that [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1498.1s)]
*  he turns 18, okay? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1502.6799999999998s)]
*  And I know that people are saying, we're just going to get in and get out. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1505.08s)]
*  I don't see any reason to believe that. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1509.6399999999999s)]
*  I see many more reasons to believe that there would be even more calls for intervention [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1512.04s)]
*  when things collapse. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that people calling for intervention on this are going to continue to call for [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1518.2s)]
*  more intervention in the future. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1522.0s)]
*  And I just would encourage everyone to be skeptical. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1524.3200000000002s)]
*  I understand being afraid. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1527.3200000000002s)]
*  I think we've been burned before with WMDs and stuff like that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1529.0s)]
*  But let me ask you one question before I move on to Tyrus. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1531.8000000000002s)]
*  Is there a situation where you could see America enjoining any war? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1534.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, but I think that we, saying there should be no war ever, that's not what I'm talking [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1539.5600000000002s)]
*  about. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1546.8000000000002s)]
*  It's the same playbook that we see. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1547.8s)]
*  I don't see, I mean, just three months ago, Tulsi Gabbard said that Iran's not building [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1549.84s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1554.36s)]
*  There are many more reasons to be skeptical than there are reasons to hop on board with [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1556.0s)]
*  this. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1561.72s)]
*  And the people who say, okay, just this intervention, how long have they been saying just this intervention? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1562.72s)]
*  Many of these same people. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1567.68s)]
*  I have every reason to believe that just this intervention is the first and many more times [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1568.68s)]
*  they're going to say, okay, just this one. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1572.8s)]
*  And calling for intervention now is, to me, the clearest sign that they'll call for further. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1574.8s)]
*  Tyrus, what say you? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1579.56s)]
*  Let's get them. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1583.2s)]
*  We've had, I don't know the exact numbers, but I believe 43 Americans have been killed [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1585.52s)]
*  with what happened with October 7th. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1593.0s)]
*  We still have hostages out there. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1595.08s)]
*  They tried to assassinate our president. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1597.6s)]
*  They had four years to basically rebuild their nuclear stuff. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1600.88s)]
*  That's why it's so deep at the bottom of the mountain. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1604.72s)]
*  We don't know what they have in there. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1606.7800000000002s)]
*  There is a weapon of mass destruction because they had 60 days to fix this and they got [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1608.6000000000001s)]
*  comfortable in four years being able to do whatever they want. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1615.44s)]
*  They build up their resources. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1617.72s)]
*  They could have gone on to do other positive things, but what did they do? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1619.6200000000001s)]
*  They loaded up Hamas, they loaded up Hezbollah. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1623.68s)]
*  That's their army. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1626.8600000000001s)]
*  And they decided to invade Israel. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1628.4s)]
*  So America, how many times do we have to get little hits in the face to all the people [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1630.68s)]
*  who lost their family members, all the people who were waiting every night to see if their [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1635.76s)]
*  hostages were going to come home or the ones that got home in the body bar? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1639.26s)]
*  We always say one American death is too many. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1642.2s)]
*  They tried to assassinate our president. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1645.3200000000002s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1646.6000000000001s)]
*  At what point is it time to say, Iran, your time is up. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  It's time to make you new Persia. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1650.68s)]
*  And if we bring those big, beautiful bombs, as he calls them, and place them in the right [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1653.24s)]
*  place and their little mountaintop is gone, they have nothing left. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1659.0s)]
*  This is the time where you need to support Israel because Israel deals with a real existential [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1663.0800000000002s)]
*  threat every day. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1667.46s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan are all in line this time. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1669.28s)]
*  Everybody on the region wants peace, but there's one small little one. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1673.04s)]
*  Syria ain't Syria anymore. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1676.76s)]
*  Turkey ain't Turkey anymore. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1678.04s)]
*  So Iran needs to become Iran. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1679.04s)]
*  Past tense. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1681.64s)]
*  A diversity of opinion here on Gutfeld. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1684.64s)]
*  You don't see that anywhere else. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1691.44s)]
*  Certainly not on Fox. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1693.5200000000002s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1694.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1695.5200000000002s)]
*  Joking. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1696.5200000000002s)]
*  Up next, Capitol Hill's crying clown. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0vb3R11P-Y&t=1697.5200000000002s)]
