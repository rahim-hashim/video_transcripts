# Fox News Highlights - March 11, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU)
*  A melting pot no more. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, most Americans would be shocked to learn that non-citizens have the right to enter [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=5.28s)]
*  our country, advocate for the overthrow of the United States, disrupt the education of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=9.84s)]
*  thousands of students, create chaos on a college campus like Alexis just talked about, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=14.88s)]
*  and then run to our courts to protect them from the consequences of their own actions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=20.0s)]
*  Now, from my perspective, even if the court precedent does give non-citizens certain rights, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=24.88s)]
*  free speech concerns don't really come into play if our officials, according to the terms of a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=29.84s)]
*  statute duly passed, determine that a non-American poses a national security risk to the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=35.12s)]
*  Now, the statute in question is Section 237A4C of the INA, an alien whose presence or activities [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=41.44s)]
*  in the United States, the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe what have potentially [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable. Now, there is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=54.56s)]
*  an exception in this law which states that an alien should not be deported because of the alien's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=62.0s)]
*  past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations, if such belief statements or [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=68.48s)]
*  associations would be lawful within the United States. Unless, and here's the key, the Secretary [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=75.04s)]
*  of State personally determines that the alien's admission would comprise a compelling United [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=81.6s)]
*  States foreign policy interest, compromise that interest. And in this case, what happened? Well, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=89.6s)]
*  Secretary Rubio has made the determination in a letter that Mahmoud Khalil's ongoing presence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=95.28s)]
*  would in fact compromise a compelling foreign policy interest. You with me? But the radicals, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  of course, are trying to use this as a way to scare you. If you believe in constitutional rights, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=108.64s)]
*  if you understand that they're targeting this person and everyone knows he has been very vocal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=115.6s)]
*  against the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza and they're targeting him and refusing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=120.56s)]
*  him constitutional rights, who's next? As Rashida claimed. Now, look, it's simply absurd to believe [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=126.56s)]
*  that our framers wrote our constitution to safeguard the rights of non-citizens whose [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=132.4s)]
*  entire goal is to seize power in the United States in order to benefit our enemies. Now, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  here's the bottom line. The left is trying to blow this up into a big story for their own political [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=145.12s)]
*  self-preservation. Why? They know there are a lot more Mahmoud Khalil's out there and they're living [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=150.16s)]
*  here, they're working here, they're studying here on student visas, on work visas, and it is their [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=156.88s)]
*  goal, the left's goal, to normalize this notion of foreigners coming here and then advocating for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  the overthrow of our government, spewing this vile anti-Americanism and of course in this instance, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=169.04s)]
*  anti-Semitism. We know native-born radicals, we've seen this a lot, already hate America, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=175.2s)]
*  but for now they're out of power and with Trump the tide seems to be turning against them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=181.52s)]
*  The truth is the hard left in the United States needs reinforcements from abroad [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=187.44s)]
*  to finish the job they started in earnest under Obama. So these rabid lunatics do not have a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=191.92s)]
*  positive theory about what America is supposed to be. To them, America and Americans are a blot on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=199.52s)]
*  the global landscape. The sooner our country and Americans are gone, the better the world will be. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=206.24s)]
*  Now think of the difference between how this new left thinks about our country, that it's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=212.96s)]
*  systemically racist, it's imperialist, what the pro-Hamas people think, as compared to the way [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=217.28s)]
*  the old liberals thought about it. They thought America just needed to live up to its founding [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=222.72s)]
*  principles in order to succeed. That's what Martin Luther King believed. Listen to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=227.68s)]
*  I Had a Dream speech. That's what JFK believed. That's what Abraham Lincoln, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=232.96s)]
*  of course, Republican, but revered by the left believed. But today the hard left wants the entire [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=236.88s)]
*  system smashed. You see it on college campuses. That's what they want. Upheaval. That's bad enough [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=242.8s)]
*  when we have American citizens believing this, but there is nothing in our history, nothing in basic [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=248.96s)]
*  common sense that compels us to admit foreigners, let them stay here, who believe any of this. This [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=254.88s)]
*  is a recipe for total chaos. Justice Robert H. Jackson writing in The Descent in Terminalo [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=261.44s)]
*  versus Chicago back in 1949 got it right. The choice is not between order and liberty. It is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=268.0s)]
*  between liberty with order and anarchy without either. There is danger that if the court does [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=274.32s)]
*  not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=280.96s)]
*  bill of rights into a suicide pact. This question of whether this Columbia grad threatens national [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=286.96s)]
*  security, it should be left up to the Secretary of State and the President. This individual is not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=293.12s)]
*  an American citizen. He has whatever rights were given to him by statute. As I mentioned earlier, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=298.32s)]
*  the statute says it's up to Rubio to decide whether that individual poses a national security risk. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=304.4s)]
*  Now, 1999, the Immigration Appeals Court ruling sent a letter from the Secretary of State laying [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=311.36s)]
*  out the serious adverse foreign policy consequences for our country is deemed presumptive. They don't [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=316.72s)]
*  have to do anymore. President Trump wrote on Truth Social today, if you support terrorism, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  including the slaughtering of innocent men, women and children, your presence is contrary [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  to our national and foreign policy interests. And you are not welcome here. And at the White House, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  he drove the point home. We ought to get them all out of the country. They're troublemakers, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  they're agitators. They don't love our country. We ought to get them the hell out. I think that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=344.88s)]
*  guy we ought to get him. I heard his statements too. There were plenty bad and I think we ought [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=349.28s)]
*  to get them the hell out of the country. I watched him. I watched tapes specifically. I watched tapes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=353.52s)]
*  and you can have them. Okay. You can have them and you can have the rest of them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=359.52s)]
*  If we continue to give safe haven to those who ultimately seek our destruction, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=366.0s)]
*  we'll eventually end up with a knife at our throats. Now it doesn't have to be a mob on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=370.8s)]
*  college campuses. It can be a single disaffected angry refugee. What some in Europe are calling [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=375.36s)]
*  low cost jihadists. A horrifying story in the spectator. One of these low cost extremists was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  last week jailed for life by a French court. And October, 2020 Tunisian Brahim Awasawi murdered [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  three Christians with a knife outside a church in Nice. One of the victims, a 44 year old woman, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=395.52s)]
*  was stabbed 25 times. During his trial Awasawi justified his actions by claiming, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  you the West kill Muslims, women and children. These innocent people who die every day, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=407.12s)]
*  aren't they human? Don't they have families? The UAE's foreign minister tried to warn the West [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=412.88s)]
*  years ago. They will come a day that we will see far more radical extremists and terrorists [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=418.72s)]
*  coming out of Europe because of the lack of decision making, trying to be politically correct [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  or assuming that they know the Middle East and they know Islam and they know the others far [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=437.44000000000005s)]
*  better than we do. And I'm sorry, but that's pure ignorance. Well, unfortunately, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=444.16s)]
*  ignorance is something we have a surplus of in our government, but no more. American citizenship [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  for the foreign born is not a right. It's a privilege that we should be very carefully [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=456.56s)]
*  bestowing upon only the most deserving. America first. If it were up to me, I'd freeze all [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=462.72s)]
*  immigration until we really got a handle on who's here and why, until we deport the millions here [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=468.8s)]
*  illegally or who threatened our national security. And that includes Mr. Khalil. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=473.76s)]
*  And that's the angle. Trump went car shopping today. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=479.12s)]
*  Hello, president Trump. Are you looking to buy or lease today? Well, I'm going to buy [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=482.64s)]
*  and I'm going to buy because number one, it's a great product as good as it gets. Now here's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=486.96s)]
*  the bad news. I'm not allowed to drive because I haven't driven a car in a long time and I love [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=491.92s)]
*  to drive cars, but I'm going to have it at the White House and I'm going to let my staff use it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=497.2s)]
*  I'm going to let people at the place use it. And they all are all excited about that. I'm not [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=502.16s)]
*  allowed to use it. Can you believe it? Watch out ladies. If you see a Tesla whipping around DC [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  next week, it might be Stephen Miller and Trump just laid his eyes on a red one. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  Should I get in? Get in. Okay. Have you ever sat by one of these other Tesla? Do you want my notes? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They gave me notes. I said, I'm not Biden. I don't need notes. I'll watch secret service go [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  crazy. Thank you. I mean, if you actually drove it around, they're really well. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=531.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=539.28s)]
*  That's beautiful. This is a different panel than I've had. Everything's computer. You don't want me [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=544.0s)]
*  to drive it to you. This is really amazing. I think Biden could get into that car. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  Binder used to say, why would Biden buy an EV? Presidents don't drive. Well, Trump doesn't drive [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=555.28s)]
*  either. And he just paid sticker price for one. He should have haggled whatever happened to the art [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=561.2s)]
*  of the deal. The Democrats saw Trump buy a Tesla on the White House lawn and said the car is ugly. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's the most corrupt administration in American history. Democrats are mad that Trump's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=572.08s)]
*  promoting EVs. It's what Biden did for four years. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President. This sucker quick. How does it compare to the Corvette? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=586.24s)]
*  It's a beautiful car. Biden gave billions to Detroit to build EVs and then gave Americans [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=591.2s)]
*  eight grand in rebates to buy one. But he didn't buy one. He said he liked his Corvette better [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=597.84s)]
*  because the way the engine purred. The only reason 47 is buying a Tesla is because Democrats are [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  fire bombing them. That's beautiful. Mr. President talks about some of the violence that's been [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=610.24s)]
*  going on around the country at dealerships. Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=617.28s)]
*  I will do that. I'll do it. I'm going to stop them. We catch anybody doing it because they're harming [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=622.64s)]
*  a great American company. When you heard an American company, especially a company like this, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  supplies so many jobs that others are unable to do. When you do that, those people are going to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  go through a big problem when we catch them. Let me tell you, you do it to Tesla and you do it to any [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=639.76s)]

*  They don't make them in Mexico. That's the whole point of Trump's trade agenda. Made in America, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=669.6s)]
*  buy American, create jobs and boost wages. What is your message, president Trump, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  buying a new car while there are some folks who will see this clip at home and they are struggling [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=680.64s)]

*  away our jobs. This economy, in my opinion, is going to blow it away. But what I have to do is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=701.12s)]
*  I have to get the workers back. I have to get the factories open. We gave it away. Presidents before [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=706.88s)]

*  This trade war is really a war for American independence. President Trump will not repeat [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=798.48s)]
*  the trend of past American presidents who broke their promises to the American public [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=804.32s)]

*  that? They don't have one. What's the Democrats plan to lower foreign tariffs? They don't have one. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=837.28s)]
*  The stock market was good under Biden because Joe never did anything and the market liked certainty [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  and the market was certain Joe was asleep. No news, no new action, it was predictable. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=849.68s)]
*  Wall Street did great but how'd the American worker do? They got hammered by inflation and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=855.5999999999999s)]
*  illegal immigration and Trump was elected to correct this and that's what he's doing. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=860.96s)]
*  The tariffs are unpredictable and the market hates that. They have to plan ahead and they can't move [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=866.32s)]
*  factories back here like that. That takes time and money and Wall Street has plenty of money [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  but the American worker doesn't have the time and Canada especially has gotten a free ride for far [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=878.0s)]
*  too long. Trump's been trying to make them an offer they can't refuse. Quote, the only thing that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=884.48s)]
*  makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished 51st state. This would make all tariffs and [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=889.68s)]
*  everything else totally disappear. Yesterday our neighbors to the north decided they wanted to do [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=895.28s)]
*  things the hard way. They slapped a 25 percent tariff on electricity coming into the country [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=901.04s)]
*  which would jack up utility prices in New York, Michigan, Minnesota. Trump hit back this morning [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=906.8s)]
*  announcing he was doubling the tariffs on Canadian steel from 25 percent to 50. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=913.68s)]
*  The Canadians didn't like that and they fired the first official shot of the American-Canadian war. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=918.8s)]
*  Let me be clear, I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If necessary, if the United States [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=926.64s)]
*  escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely. That's an act of war. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=933.68s)]
*  That's like a utility company telling the army base next door they're going to shut their power [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=942.0s)]
*  off. The army base that protects them and everybody else in town. Trump couldn't believe it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=946.4s)]
*  He declared a national emergency on electricity. Quote, can you imagine Canada stooping so low as [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=952.48s)]
*  to use electricity that so affects the life of innocent people as a bargaining chip and threat? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=958.56s)]
*  They will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in history books for [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=964.72s)]
*  many years to come. The Canadians immediately called the White House and backed down. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=969.92s)]
*  As you know, there's a very strong man in Canada who said he was going to charge a surcharge or a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=974.4s)]
*  tariff on electricity coming into our country. He's already, he has called and he said he's not [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=981.76s)]
*  going to do that. Okay, not going to do that. And it would have been a very bad thing if he did. And [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=986.9599999999999s)]
*  he's not going to do that. So I respect that. Can you believe the nerve of Canada trying to pull [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=992.48s)]
*  our plug over a steel tariff? Which is just a tactic Trump's using to renegotiate the USMCA [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=996.72s)]
*  that comes up for review next year? It's directed at Canada because you look at Toyota, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1002.64s)]
*  Toyota builds the RAV4 and some Lexus models up in Canada. The RAV4 is wildly popular. One of the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1008.8s)]
*  most popular vehicles sold here in the United States. So, you know, what this is, this is the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1014.88s)]
*  Trump administration saying to Canada, you think you have these plants? Think again, we want them [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1020.48s)]
*  down here. The media won't tell you this, but major companies are pouring back into this country. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1025.2s)]
*  Honda, Hyundai, Volvo, LG, Samsung, Stellantis, Volkswagen, the list goes on. American Steel [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1029.76s)]
*  loves what Trump's doing. And so do the Teamsters who didn't endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1037.12s)]
*  It's almost comical if it didn't have an economic effect. It's like, you know, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1042.72s)]
*  he puts the tariff in, he puts the tariff out, he puts the tariff in, he puts the tariff out, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1047.44s)]
*  then he does the hokey pokey and he turns us all around. We're in a world of hurt. No matter what [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1051.44s)]
*  Donald Trump tells you, because he's nervous, he's scared, he's doing these interviews because [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1056.4s)]
*  he's trying to change the narrative, such negative news. We're in a recession. We are. And in [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1059.92s)]
*  dictatorship, but we're in a recession. And it's going to be worse in the next couple of days and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1066.24s)]
*  worse after that because he has started a trade war that we're going to lose. And it's unbelievable [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  that there's people believing it. A dictator triggered a recession by starting a trade war [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1075.52s)]
*  he's going to lose. That's the media's patriotic message. Well, I guess we should just go back to [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1080.16s)]
*  Bidenomics where life was so affordable and foreigners never invaded our country and stole [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1085.6s)]
*  our jobs and factories. The treasury secretary, Scott Besson says the economy needs to detox [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  from Bidenomics. The thing is that the markets aren't taken into account, my view, and I think [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  this is pretty much backed up by everybody I'm speaking to, is that there's like, like there's [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  some goodies coming, right? Lower taxes, less regulation, less fentanyl in this country because [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1107.04s)]
*  we closed the borders, which is going to be good for the economy. Less immigration, which means you [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  don't have illegal immigrants clouding our healthcare system. All this is happening right now. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1118.72s)]
*  And, and it's not being factored into the market. So I would just say this, if you're looking at [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1124.24s)]
*  this sort of broadly, this is a puke. It needs to get some of this out of our system. Now, if you're [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1128.56s)]
*  retiring now, first of all, congratulations. You've experienced the greatest market run in civilization. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  Look at this chart from the eighties. If you put a hundred thousand dollars in the market in 1980, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1143.2800000000002s)]
*  didn't touch it, didn't even add to it. You'd retire today with $7 million. No one likes to lose [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1148.0s)]
*  money, but the Dow is basically flat since the election. I know it's been about four months. It [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1154.0s)]
*  seems like longer and Trump's not running for reelection. So he's doing the tough stuff that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1158.96s)]
*  no other politician would ever do. Fight trade wars, buck Wall Street, cut spending, because it's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1164.4s)]
*  in the longterm interest of the American people. Your comments the other day, not ruling out a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1170.64s)]
*  potential recession seemed to rattle the stock markets. The commerce secretary said there [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  wouldn't be one just so you know, specifically on the recession. Yeah. Do you think there will be a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1181.0400000000002s)]
*  recession? I don't see it at all. I think this country is going to boom, but as I said, I can [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1185.68s)]
*  do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1190.96s)]
*  are going to be 20 times greater. And remember, Trump is always right. If you look at what I've [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1196.16s)]
*  said over the last 10 years, Trump has been right all the time. This is the way to do it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1202.48s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. And tonight we have a lot of ground to cover with big developments at home [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1211.68s)]
*  and abroad. White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, we will get our White House briefing from [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1215.52s)]
*  her and more on her clash with the so-called reporter from the very anti-Trump Associated [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1220.08s)]
*  Press, very woke Associated Press, and later part two of my exclusive interview with HHS [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1226.0s)]
*  secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who made this promise during our trip this weekend to Steak and Shake. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1231.9199999999998s)]
*  If you tried to take away the president's favorite foods, you would be fired. I'm pretty convinced. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1239.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to do that. You better not take away the president's food. Not going to happen. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1244.48s)]
*  Anyway, we're going to have much more of our interview later in the show. We'll talk about [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1251.52s)]
*  measles. We will talk about the price of eggs and avion and everything else that's going on. But [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1254.4s)]
*  first tonight, thanks to President Trump, we are one giant step closer to peace in Europe. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1260.96s)]
*  Ah, we can all pray. Take a look. Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1266.4s)]
*  which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1271.76s)]
*  a way that's enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interests, their security, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1277.44s)]
*  their ability to prosper as a nation. We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1281.84s)]
*  they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court. The fighting has [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1286.32s)]
*  to stop. I mean, that's what we agreed today. And just think about it. We've gone from if the war's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1290.64s)]
*  going to end to now how the war's going to end. And this was an important first step and that was [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1296.64s)]
*  under President Trump's leadership. He has literally moved the entire global conversation [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1302.48s)]
*  to where we had a very senior Ukrainian delegation with us today. We've had engagements [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  with our Russian counterparts and now it's how the war's going to end. And that's under [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1312.48s)]
*  President Trump's leadership. Ah, I wonder all the praise from America's old school hippie liberals, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, the ones that used to love to sing, you know, all we're saying is give peace a chance. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1323.36s)]
*  Where have all those people gone? This is by far the closest we have come to peace since the start [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1328.56s)]
*  of this war. I hope the death and destruction ends. Anybody with a heart, conscience, and soul [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1333.52s)]
*  should hope for the same. But just 10 days ago, my memory serves me well, the state-run legacy [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1338.24s)]
*  media mob, Democrats, they were all hysterical. This after Zelensky's tense meeting at the White [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1344.32s)]
*  House, they told us Trump ruined America's relationship with Ukraine and are standing [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1349.36s)]
*  around the world for years and years to come and that peace was never going to even have a [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1354.08s)]
*  chance to happen. You might recall. Take a look. Becoming the air hours after an oval office [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1359.6799999999998s)]
*  ambush of an American ally that will reverberate all around the world and stain America's image [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1366.24s)]
*  for years to come. It revealed instead of Donald Trump and a JD Vance clearly on an [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  errand for Vladimir Putin. They are popping the champagne in Moscow. They've got their best vodka [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1378.0s)]
*  out and they're doing shots as we speak. I mean, that's exactly the same thought that went through [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1383.52s)]
*  my head. The propaganda is what's coming out of JD Vance's mouth and it's Russian propaganda. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1388.24s)]
*  Caitlin, I want to start with look at her face. I mean, Christiane, hold that thought for once. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1393.04s)]
*  Okay, actually Christiane, please take it away. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1399.52s)]
*  Never in the history of modern diplomacy, war, peace, whatever, have I ever, ever, ever seen [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1404.56s)]
*  anything like it? No, you've never met a force like Donald Trump before. That's about right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  Blinded by their anti-Trump rage, Democrats, the legacy media mob, they are unable, unwilling to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1419.04s)]
*  tell their viewers the truth. Now, if you were watching this program, you are definitely better [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1425.68s)]
*  informed. In fact, here is what I was reporting 10 days ago. Take a look. I predict Zelensky, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1430.8s)]
*  he's going to be back. He has to be back. You know, how much more death and destruction will, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1438.72s)]
*  will it take for him to come back? Now, if the media mob wasn't so blinded by their anti-Trump [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1444.5600000000002s)]
*  rage, they'd be able to see the following pattern. Let me walk you through it, especially if you're [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1450.64s)]
*  in the state-run media mob, I'll go very slow for your benefit. Step one, President Trump introduces [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1454.88s)]
*  a plan and tense negotiations usually ensue right thereafter. Step two, Democrats, the media, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1460.64s)]
*  they all freak out. It's like Alka-Seltzer in water. They bubble and fizz and they hate Trump [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1467.92s)]
*  and they tell everyone that the sky is falling and the world is coming to an end. Step three, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1473.2800000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump uses America's tremendous strength and leverage to negotiate as many favorable deals [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1478.3200000000002s)]
*  that are in America and the world's best interest. Step four, the chicken littles on the left, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1484.56s)]
*  they look stupid and dishonest as per usual. This pattern is now playing out yet again with trade [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1490.08s)]
*  negotiations and tariffs against Canada, Mexico, et cetera. But guess what? Canada just backed down [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1496.0s)]
*  from a 25% tax on electricity exported to the U.S. and Trump's proposed tariffs on Canadian steel and [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1501.84s)]
*  aluminum, they have been paused while the two countries hopefully will be able to hammer out [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1508.96s)]
*  a deal of free and fair trade. Now, we've got to deal with real issues here. Canada must address [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1513.84s)]
*  three very glaring issues. First, they need to shut down illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1521.6799999999998s)]
*  across their border with the U.S. It has never been higher than it is now. Second, the free ride [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1527.1999999999998s)]
*  for our friends in Canada, and I consider the people in Canada our friends, is over. Canada must [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1532.9599999999998s)]
*  start paying for their own self-defense. And don't forget, all NATO allies are required to spend 2% [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1538.4s)]
*  of their GDP on defense. The U.S. spends nearly double that target at almost $1 trillion a year. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1545.2s)]
*  Canada, meanwhile, only spends a measly 1.37% of its GDP on national defense. Our neighbors to the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1552.88s)]
*  must fulfill their obligation to NATO. Third, the issue that Canada must resolve are the pre-Trump [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1562.96s)]
*  tariffs and limits imposed against a variety of American goods. You may not know this. We already [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1569.52s)]
*  have a trade imbalance with Canada, and by the way, they already have put tariffs on us. How many of [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1575.52s)]
*  you knew that? For example, a base 7.5% tariff on milk, but the amount of imports is capped. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1581.2s)]
*  And after that cap is reached, then the tariff rises to a whopping 241%. That's not good for [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1588.08s)]
*  American dairy farmers in Wisconsin and elsewhere. There's also a 200% supply management tariff on [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1595.36s)]
*  eggs and poultry, and nearly a 300% supply management tariff on butter and cheese. Now, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1602.56s)]
*  for our friends to the north, we either have free and fair trade or we don't. If they want free and [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1609.84s)]
*  fair trade, Donald Trump will give it to them. If they choose reciprocal tariffs, that will be on [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1615.36s)]
*  them. Now, I'll also add one last thing. Canada spends $30 billion on their military every year. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1620.9599999999998s)]
*  The U.S. spends nearly a trillion dollars, and the world knows that the United States will protect [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1628.4799999999998s)]
*  our friends to the north in Canada if they are ever in need. Just a little more appreciation [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1635.04s)]
*  would be nice from our friends to the north. And I'm not sure if I really want Canada to be the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1641.6s)]
*  51st state, because I suspect that would be two more liberal senators, and we don't need that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1646.56s)]
*  But progress is now underway, and the Trump haters on the left once again look foolish. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1651.6s)]
*  Tonight, we are seeing this very same pattern play out with Doge as well. But the hysteria directed [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1656.08s)]
*  and the outright evil directed at Elon Musk is absolutely insane. He is receiving now constant [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1662.24s)]
*  death threats. Tesla dealerships, Tesla owners are under attack all over the country. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1668.4s)]
*  The smears, the lies from the media mob, the Democratic Party, the radical left are nonstop. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1674.24s)]
*  Why? All because Elon Musk supported Donald Trump, is now helping Donald Trump and losing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1680.16s)]
*  billions of dollars in the process. He's helping to identify waste fraud, abuse, and the Washington [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1686.96s)]
*  swamp. He's helping to save our country from ultimate bankruptcy and insolvency. He's also [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1692.24s)]
*  hopefully saving astronauts in just a few short days. I pray that mission goes well. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1698.96s)]
*  I have every hope that it will. And today the White House announced that attacks against Tesla [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1704.16s)]
*  dealerships will be labeled as domestic terrorism. And he had this to say about the leader of Doge. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1708.72s)]
*  Take a look. This man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this. I think he's been treated [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1714.3200000000002s)]
*  very unfairly by a very small group of people. And I just want people to know that you can't be [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1721.0400000000002s)]
*  penalized for being a patriot. And he's a great patriot. Now let's be clear. The anger, the [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1728.0s)]
*  hysteria, the the rekted at Elon Musk and Doge from the left, it is ugly. It is sick. It is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1734.4s)]
*  twisted. It is now becoming downright evil and dangerous. And for the record, as I promised [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1741.12s)]
*  yesterday, I ordered my Tesla today. It's on X. If you want to go look at it, you can take a look at [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1746.0s)]
*  it. Or you can see it on Hannity.com. But you start to understand the hysteria of the left when [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1752.64s)]
*  you see reports like this one from Politico, quote, U.S. AID official tells remaining staffers, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1758.48s)]
*  shred and burn your documents. I think that would be illegal. We ought to check with AG [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1765.2800000000002s)]
*  Pam Bondi on that. That is a pretty good sign that Elon Musk and his team at Doge are doing exactly [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1771.3600000000001s)]
*  what poll after poll of you, the American people want them to do. They are uncovering corruption [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1777.76s)]
*  and waste fraud and abuse at the highest levels, all paid for with your hard earned tax money. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1783.68s)]
*  He's hated for what? Stopping an out of control bureaucracy from stealing from your children and [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1789.12s)]
*  your grandchildren. And he's getting death threats. His dealerships are being attacked. His charging [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  stations have put a blaze and a boycott to try and bankrupt him. This is beyond sick. And once [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1800.4s)]
*  again, the state run media mob, Democratic Party, they look stupid, dishonest, et cetera. But tonight [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1807.6s)]
*  we have yet another example of this pattern surrounding the price of eggs for the past four [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  weeks. The left has been in a state of hysteria. Now they told us in spite of Biden inflation, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  that it was only transitory. They said the border was secure. They said Joe was a cognitive, you [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1824.1599999999999s)]
*  know, pillar of strength and the rising price of eggs blaming Trump for the economy that he [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1829.4399999999998s)]
*  inherited, even though the increase was caused by the Biden administration and bird flu related [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1836.24s)]
*  to mass murder of chickens. Now, after less than two months under Donald Trump, oh, look at this. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1842.72s)]
*  Prices are starting to come down. Take a look. I had no inflation. I had a great economy. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1849.2s)]
*  He gave you high prices. You couldn't buy bacon. You couldn't buy anything. And also [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1855.84s)]
*  I inherited a situation with eggs. The price of eggs was through the roof. Well, now the price [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1860.32s)]
*  of eggs has come down a lot. Interest rates have come down. Gasoline prices have come down. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1866.0s)]
*  It's all coming down. It's all a beautiful thing. I can do it the right way or the wrong way. We're [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1872.64s)]
*  doing it the right way. And I have tremendous confidence in this country and the people of this [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1877.36s)]
*  country, tremendous confidence, much more so than if I sat back for four years and had a good time [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1881.68s)]
*  in the Oval Office. Now, the moral of the story is simple. Tune out the noise and the hysteria and [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1887.68s)]
*  the lying and the screaming. And you know what? If there are great patriots that are trying to [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1893.28s)]
*  help our country and they're under fire for doing nothing but serving the people in this country, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  you know what? Maybe we can help support them because obviously the left is just got a vendetta [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1904.08s)]
*  attitude about everything. There's no doubt that we're still dealing with the effects of Biden's [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1909.76s)]
*  terrible presidency. We are living under the Biden-Harris economy, but President Trump is busy [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1914.8s)]
*  now executing the plan that he wants to fix what is broken and generate a new era of peace and [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1920.8s)]
*  prosperity, what he calls a golden age in America. The results are starting to pour in. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1926.96s)]
*  Roll that thing up a little. Enough! Enough! You're making the other shows feel bad. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1932.08s)]

*  disproving the theory that Michelle and her brother were the same person. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=1982.88s)]

*  will remain male and British. Well, that rules out Prince Harry. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  Researchers say the more you spend time with dogs, the more likely you are to misread their emotions. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  For example, this one isn't angry. It's hungry. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2058.96s)]
*  According to a new survey, attractive workers earn $20,000 more per year than unattractive ones. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2074.2400000000002s)]
*  For example, here's some data on famous faces. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2079.84s)]
*  And a London club has banned audience members with frozen faces that are due to Botox. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2089.84s)]
*  So guess who canceled their girls trip to England? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2097.1200000000003s)]
*  They look the same. They do look the same. Is that Michael Jackson? Yes, it is. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2103.1200000000003s)]
*  All right, so how do you know when you're doing the right thing? When you drive the nutty people, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2107.9199999999996s)]
*  even nuttier. Here's a federal worker losing her mind over Elon's five work achievements email. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2111.9199999999996s)]
*  When you wake up or when you're on your weekend and you get the fork in the road message, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2118.8799999999997s)]
*  or you get the subsequent five bullets, hey, what the hell did you do, you lazy federal worker, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2125.04s)]
*  this week? How frightening is it that someone on X, the owner of X, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2132.56s)]
*  speaks to you directly to say, what did you do last week at work? And if you don't answer, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  I am going to fire you. Okay. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2150.64s)]
*  So an email that asks you what you did at work is terrifying. Oh, you're going to hate being married. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  So glad you wore the mask, you know, you didn't want to catch anything from people 50 yards away. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2165.84s)]
*  But also you get asked what you did at work all the time in the private sector. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2172.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you what I did off the top of my head. Last week, I taped the five in Gutfeld. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2176.4s)]
*  I did an interview with NPR. I met with my team over scripts, and I made Peter Doocy shave my back. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  He volunteered. I said, yes. Look, no one's calling all federal employees lazy, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  but when we give you 40 billion for Wi-Fi and no one's hooked up, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2198.08s)]
*  we're going to want to see what it is you do all day. For some odd reason, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2202.08s)]
*  Dems can't deal with a president that expects a return on our tax dollars. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2206.32s)]
*  Right now, Musk might be the one immigrant the left doesn't love, despite his many illegitimate children. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2211.44s)]
*  Is that a funny word? Of course. Not to me. If he committed, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2220.4s)]
*  if Musk had committed a few dozen felonies, they'd build him a statue. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2227.28s)]
*  But maybe it took an immigrant, someone from outside the system, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2232.8s)]
*  to show us how our governments become more bloated than Jerry Nadler after a cheese whiz enema. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  That's how he takes it. Musk visited our good friend Larry and stressed Doge's transparency. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2243.44s)]
*  When people criticize, say what Doge is doing, we say, well, which part specifically? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2251.92s)]
*  Because we put all of the actions of the Doge team on the Doge.gov website. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2255.76s)]
*  And on the Doge handle on X. So we post the receipts. So it's like, this action has been [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2262.32s)]
*  taken, this action has been taken, which cost saving do you disagree with? And people usually [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2268.0s)]
*  can't think of any. Of course, transparency can suck, like if you come across Michael Moore in a [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2272.6400000000003s)]
*  damp moomoo. But not only are Musk and Doge trying to save taxpayers billions, they're actually [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2278.48s)]
*  posting the details of exactly how they're doing it on a website. Now, every elected official vows [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2284.6400000000003s)]
*  to have the most transparent administration ever. But have you ever seen him do it, to actually make [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2290.48s)]
*  the effort open to the American public? Nope. And we put up with that for years. Meanwhile, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2295.52s)]
*  with private companies, people trash Delta on X if you can't get a rep on the phone in three minutes [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2301.6s)]
*  with your complaint about your seat upgrade, or to ask why your all-female crew landed the plane on [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2307.36s)]
*  its back. But we let the government pick our pockets daily and tell us what kind of light bulbs [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2313.52s)]
*  and stoves we could buy. We always knew they were screwing us. Now we have the receipts for the condoms [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2323.52s)]
*  to prove it. And the left is furious. Yep, the same people who glue themselves to my helicopter pad [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2328.96s)]
*  over climate change now can't stand the guy who sells more electric cars than anyone on Earth. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2335.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, wasn't Musk an environmental superhero a few years ago when he was leading us all into a [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2340.32s)]
*  carbon-free future? And how many greenhouse gases are you adding to the atmosphere when you burn [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2345.1200000000003s)]
*  down Tesla dealerships? Because right now, fire-bombing Musk's stores has become the left's new [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2350.56s)]
*  pastime. Meet Lucy. I know you're surprised, right? He used to go by Justin. He got caught [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2356.4s)]
*  tossing Molotov cocktails at a Colorado Tesla dealership a few weeks ago. Of course, he got [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2368.0s)]
*  released the next day. And as usual, the mainstreamers ignored the story just like they ignored their [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2373.76s)]
*  ratings. Imagine if someone had vandalized a Planned Parenthood, you'd sure know that person's [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2379.92s)]
*  name and face. But this guy is trans. Gorgeous at that. And on the right side, so he's fine. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2385.2s)]
*  It's so funny how the Dems back some transitions and not others. Little boys into little girls? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2393.12s)]
*  Sure. Fossil fuels replaced by windmills? Why not? Red meat replaced by an insect puree? That's [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2398.56s)]
*  progress. The transitions the Dems embrace are bat-sh-t crazy. But when it comes to a practical [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2404.4s)]
*  transition, one that seeks to change a corrupt system into a transparent and efficient one, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2411.04s)]
*  well, they fire-bomb a shop. But once you've decided against all evidence and reality that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2416.4s)]
*  you are the good guy, you can excuse anything. They even push the myth that Musk is in it for [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2421.2s)]
*  himself. Have you seen Tesla's stock lately? It's lower than Rosie O'Donnell's testicles. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2426.72s)]
*  Slow. This guy's willing to bankrupt his company to prevent the bankruptcy of his country. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2441.6s)]
*  Something the Bernies and the Pelosi's of the world would never do. But the media pushes this [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2447.6s)]
*  lie as they push the Biden is fine cover-up because it helps Dems. Never mind that both [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2452.56s)]
*  hoaxes harm America. It's all to benefit an angry and lost party. Finally, if we're finding all [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2457.84s)]
*  about this now, you know what's been going on for years. Meaning they wasted your parents' money, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2463.92s)]
*  too. It just got worse the last 10 years when the government was hijacked by activists. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2469.52s)]
*  Mad about your job prospects, pissed off that you're the first generation that won't do better [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2475.2s)]
*  than mom and dad? Well, maybe you would have been better off if dough should come along decades ago. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2479.6s)]
*  Then you wouldn't be a PhD who has to bathe in a Starbucks restroom. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2484.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's welcome, Terri Skaas. She has a new last name, which Democrats just say, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2489.2799999999997s)]
*  Republican strategist Aaron Maguire. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2496.24s)]
*  When he cooks outside, he's a public master baster, chef Andrew Grohl. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2498.0s)]
*  She's got four I's, two kids and zero F's. Host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2512.48s)]
*  And he's enormous and here to inform us. New York Times best [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2520.88s)]
*  week author, comedian and former debut champion. Aaron, what did you make of that federal employee [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2524.72s)]
*  in the mask complaining that her boss asked her what she did for a living? Not really her boss, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2538.72s)]
*  so to speak, but he is kind of right now. Well, I think this is exactly why doge exists is because [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2544.3199999999997s)]
*  we I have worked in the government before. We've known that these bureaucrats were always [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2550.08s)]
*  entrenched in the system, but now we're able to get them out and apparently doing the bare minimum [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2553.68s)]
*  of telling people what you do for your paycheck is too much to ask for. Yes, but Democrats can't [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2558.0s)]
*  hide their crazy anymore. And it's been really fun to watch because they are having a slow meltdown [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2563.44s)]
*  over the fact that a man is trying to not waste money and that is causing them to freak out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2568.3199999999997s)]
*  They are asking you what you did and where the money went. And Democrats are saying, oh, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2575.44s)]
*  dear God, no. So I think that Republicans have a better chance at the midterms now. If Democrats [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2579.12s)]
*  keep chasing Elon around D.C. I love it. How Dems will tell you their pronouns and who they bang, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2583.28s)]
*  but they won't tell you what they do for a living. How dare you ask me that? That's none of your [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2590.48s)]
*  business. But do you know that I like to sleep with goats? It's not bad. Andrew, terrible joke. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2596.48s)]
*  It is kind of interesting to see them tackle this from a business perspective. And yet they're so [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2607.44s)]
*  upset that they have to actually look at a bottom line. None of these people have ever hired an [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2612.96s)]
*  employee. They've never worked in the private sector. A few of them have, but they were probably [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2617.76s)]
*  fired. And that's why they're still mad and bitter. I also find it funny that Lucy was throwing [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2621.28s)]
*  Molotov cocktails and yet it's Trump who's the one is in bed with Russia. Molotov cocktail is [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2625.04s)]
*  their number one weapon. Something weird here. Americans have gotten fat and lazy, not all Americans, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2629.6s)]
*  but a lot of Americans have gotten fat and lazy and complacent eating off the all you can eat buffet. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2634.32s)]
*  And that's been happening for decades and it's only gotten worse and worse. And now finally, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2638.96s)]
*  as we sit here and we lack logic and reason and all of those things that we learn in elementary [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2642.8s)]
*  school and the other Americans are recognizing that we're saying, hey, you know what? We've been [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2646.7200000000003s)]
*  setting this buffet up and nobody's eating the muffins. Nobody's doing this. So we're going to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2651.44s)]
*  remove those. And they're saying, no, we want the buffet full of everything. So it's like, Elon is [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2655.44s)]
*  pulling these things right now, not social security or Medicare, things that we're just wasting money. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2659.84s)]
*  And they just still want it up there because they want it to be wasted. Whenever we hire somebody in [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2664.5600000000004s)]
*  the restaurant industry, a young kid, we have to sit them down and we have to explain to them about [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2668.8s)]
*  life and most importantly, taxes. We say, when you get your paycheck, they're going to be taxes [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2672.8s)]
*  taken out. None of them have been taught that they don't understand that. And when I watch this lady [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2676.7200000000003s)]
*  who's 65, 70 years old, um, you know, hiding her mustache behind her mask, I think to myself, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2681.76s)]
*  she reminds me of those 10 year old fifth, well, no, we don't hire 10 year olds. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2687.28s)]
*  Slip up. Yeah. She reminds me of those young teenage kids that we're hiring who don't understand how [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2692.0800000000004s)]
*  the world works. And yet somehow she slipped her way through and she's 65 and still doesn't understand [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2696.88s)]
*  how it works. I was that person. I do. I remember when I got my first paycheck, it was like 22,000 [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2701.6s)]
*  a year and I thought it was really to 22,000. Yeah. And I purchased things based on that. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2707.12s)]
*  I had no idea that I was like, maybe I was getting 15. It was pathetic, Kennedy. I know, you know, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2711.76s)]
*  Kennedy, um, I had a question here that I only thought you could answer. Yes, they're real. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2718.08s)]
*  I'm not the only one who could answer that, but thank you. I could. Don't look at me. I, I, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2727.12s)]
*  what if this Doge thing is all BS? If the, if they're passing this bill and nothing's going to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2733.44s)]
*  change, I mean, are we being suckered? Like, I can't believe that Trump and Musk would do all this [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2739.36s)]
*  and then not cut, but I'm watching him pass these bills. I'm confused by this whole budget process. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2744.56s)]
*  So you feel like you're being gaslit. Yes. So you feel like this is an episode of severance. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2751.52s)]
*  Actually, I don't believe that they would lie to us. I have good faith, but when's it going to [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2756.24s)]
*  happen? So here's the problem because Elon Musk has enough money. So he doesn't need any power. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2760.8s)]
*  He doesn't need any money, but he is agnostically looking at the federal government and he knows, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2766.48s)]
*  to your point, you're absolutely right. Like people metaphorically and practically have been [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2771.6s)]
*  at the all you can eat buffet and so have all these NGOs and every government agency. So what [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2776.4s)]
*  he's doing is he's taking away their Spanx. So, you know, it's like that sucks everyone in [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2782.32s)]
*  and hides the weight loss and he's offering them Ozempic and they're absolutely freaking out. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2788.1600000000003s)]
*  If he's doing it essentially beholden to no one. And there are people like Elizabeth Warren, like, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2793.2000000000003s)]
*  well, he's got contracts with the federal government and that may be true. And hopefully [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2798.0800000000004s)]
*  there aren't conflicts of interest, but what he's doing is so much more important and so necessary. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2801.84s)]
*  And we've been forced into this position. Unfortunately, Congress and both parties are [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2807.04s)]
*  guilty of this. They love giving the handouts. They love being the ones going, no, we're going [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2812.48s)]
*  to give you, oh, sure. We need to cut everything else, but we're going to give you chocolate cake. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2817.36s)]
*  We're going to give you blueberry muffins. We're going to give you strawberry cheesecake, all you [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2821.44s)]
*  can eat and every single district. So that's why Congress is having a really hard time making the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2825.68s)]
*  actual cuts. And that's why you're forcing it on someone who really doesn't care if he goes away [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2831.76s)]
*  from the federal government tomorrow. And to complete this analogy, they're giving all this [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2837.0400000000004s)]
*  food at the buffet and Trump and Elon, they're the colonoscopy that goes up your ass to see all the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2841.0400000000004s)]
*  damage. Cyrus, welcome back by the way. Thanks. Yes, I'm sorry. So you want me to comment on the [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2846.1600000000003s)]
*  no, I want to actually, you know, let me just, I actually don't need a question. Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2859.28s)]
*  Cause I've given this a lot of thought because the reason why they, they despise Elon is because Elon [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2863.76s)]
*  is what they pretend to be. He's an activist in the sense that he's doing something selfless to [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2871.04s)]
*  make a change with no benefit to himself, to put himself in peril. They pretend that right for [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2876.32s)]
*  profit. Good point. So he's, he's exactly, he's the mirror. You'll see it. Like if anyone watches [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2882.0s)]
*  movies, there's that great old school Mozart movie where the guy just hate him because he was good. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2886.56s)]
*  Amadeus. Amadeus. Yes. Yeah. They just didn't like him because he was good. And he shows us exactly [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2891.04s)]
*  what they're not. But see, president Trump was trying to do the same thing, but they have a [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  corrupt system in place to checks and balance him. They can get a couple of Republicans to get a [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2901.36s)]
*  couple of dollars under the table. So they won't vote for him. They'll get enough Democrats who [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2905.6s)]
*  were in it for the money making business of being corrupt. So they're all, everything he says is [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2908.96s)]
*  wrong. And plus they have fake monsters like polar bears going to die 10 years ago. And according [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2912.8s)]
*  to AOC, we're already dead, right? We're all living in purgatory right now, but they do those [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2918.0s)]
*  things. They create false things that they can control and pull, but there's not really anything [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2921.76s)]
*  there. He's showing America the real problem, the real things at his own peril to the point where, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2925.92s)]
*  and we're seeing it because anyone who attacks him, and again, this is where the Hitler Hitler [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2933.6000000000004s)]
*  stuff we always talk about coming in, they are getting people by saying they're horrible things. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2937.36s)]
*  That now we have these martyrs that are coming out to come after him. The, what was he? He was a trans [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2941.36s)]
*  dude, whatever the, Lucy, Lucy, yeah, Justin. And, um, Justin, why are, how come there's so many violent [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2947.44s)]
*  trans people lately? Trans, it's like, is this all like an angry dudes with nothing else to call [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2953.84s)]
*  themselves? Yeah. But now when they're attacking Elon, they're released from prison the next day. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2958.48s)]
*  And then the, then people come out and they don't condemn them. So they want more of it because they [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2964.4s)]
*  can't, what Elon is representing is everything against the cultural corruption that is in our [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2968.08s)]
*  government because they can't touch him because he's not in it for profit. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeLxX0IbgWU&t=2973.7599999999998s)]
