# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 5, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8)
*  Pornified culture and traumatized kids. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=4.44s)]
*  Now we hear a lot from prominent figures [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=8.4s)]
*  about the need to empower girls and women [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=10.84s)]
*  at school and sports and in the workplace. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=14.44s)]
*  I think it's important to tell all girls [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=17.36s)]
*  that you can be whatever you want to be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=19.36s)]
*  We must empower women. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=21.04s)]
*  When women succeed, all of society benefits. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=23.66s)]
*  Somehow that powerful, empowering message [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=28.9s)]
*  ended up turning us into what? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=33.38s)]
*  Toddlers and Tiaras, tweens and revealing midriffs, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=36.06s)]
*  to teens and blouses that look more like bustiers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=40.46s)]
*  Yeah, the fashion industry looked pornified over the years, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=44.58s)]
*  leading to complaints from moms and dads [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=48.34s)]
*  and anyone who cares about innocence. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=50.34s)]
*  Because of the messages that this sends [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=52.54s)]
*  to perverts and degenerates [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=54.78s)]
*  and what it does to girls' self-esteem. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=56.94s)]
*  And now the slippery slope has dropped us into the sewer, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=59.78s)]
*  where sexual subjugation and domination, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=63.06s)]
*  staples of the porn industry, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  are now common practice by young people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Because they learn these degrading practices [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=71.5s)]
*  from the porn industry. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=74.56s)]
*  And we know that the porn kings, what they create, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=76.74s)]
*  addiction, emotional abuse and violence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=80.22s)]
*  Porn has gotten more violent over the years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=84.38s)]
*  So therefore there has been more violent tendency [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  towards women during rape and dating mishaps. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=89.38s)]
*  There's also subjugation of women because of pornography. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=94.22s)]
*  People who watch porn are less likely to act [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  on sexual assault and sexual violence when they see it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=100.74s)]
*  Because they've been programmed to accept that that's okay. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=103.9s)]
*  This is why so-called non-fatal sexual strangulation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=107.94s)]
*  is now considered okay [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=113.42s)]
*  by an increasing number of college students. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=115.86s)]
*  Dr. Debbie Herbineck told the New York Times [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=119.16s)]
*  that she's tracked a dramatic and rapid rise [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  in so-called rough sex. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=126.06s)]
*  Nearly two thirds of the 5,000 female students surveyed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=128.04s)]
*  said it had happened to them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  And 40% say they were between the ages of 12 and 17 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=135.18s)]
*  for the first time they experienced this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=140.02s)]
*  Again, sexual strangulation between partners. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=142.66s)]
*  Again, you can thank the porn industry, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=149.5s)]
*  specifically websites like PornHub, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=152.32s)]
*  which are part of the industry's $100 billion global business. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=155.04s)]
*  Although stores aren't legally allowed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  to sell kids cigarettes or booze without seeing an ID, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=161.72s)]
*  somehow the porn industry has been free to profit off [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=165.3s)]
*  selling its toxic material to minors. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=169.34s)]
*  And the consequences for both young women [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=173.1s)]
*  and men who can access this have been devastating. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=175.3s)]
*  Last spring, the New York Times described [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  how-to articles around the internet [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=181.38s)]
*  and social media algorithms that feed young people, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=183.82s)]
*  but typically not their unsuspecting parents, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=187.46s)]
*  hundreds of hashtag choke me daddy memes, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=190.22s)]
*  along with memes that mock and even celebrate [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=194.3s)]
*  the potential for hurting or killing female partners. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=197.2s)]
*  And the same elites who pretend to care so much about girls [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  are culpable as well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=208.32s)]
*  Remember in 2015 when all those suburban women [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  were obsessed with the glorified gutter dive [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=213.32s)]
*  into mainstreaming porn, otherwise known [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=218.2s)]
*  as 50 Shades of Grey? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=220.56s)]
*  You're a sadist? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=222.64s)]
*  I'm a dominant. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=226.34s)]
*  It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=227.5s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=231.22s)]
*  To please me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  To please you? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=235.9s)]
*  How? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=238.02s)]
*  I have rules. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=238.86s)]
*  If you follow them, I'll reward you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  If you don't, I'll punish you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=243.34s)]
*  The threat of punishment, he says there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  And the threat of punishment and bondage [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=251.18s)]
*  is now marketed to girls online as sexual thrill seeking. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=253.18s)]
*  Peggy Orenstein wrote in The Times, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=259.02s)]
*  by 2019 when a high school girl was choked [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=261.06s)]
*  in the pilot of HBO's Euphoria, it was standard fair. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=264.58s)]
*  A young woman was choked in the opener of The Idol, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  again on HBO, and also liked the show Euphoria, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=272.7s)]
*  created by Sam Levinson. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=276.7s)]
*  What's with him? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=279.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's worth asking that question again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=281.02s)]
*  What is wrong with Sam Levinson? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=283.78s)]
*  Is that the new feminism we're supposed to want [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=287.02s)]
*  for our daughters, Sammy? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=289.02s)]
*  Nice going. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=290.82s)]
*  It's gotten so bad that emergency rooms [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=292.5s)]
*  are seeing more severe injuries [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=294.7s)]
*  from this twisted choking practice, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  which can even result in stroke and traumatic brain injuries. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=300.18s)]
*  And where consenting females often turn [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  into domestic abuse victims. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  Yet again, the kinkier the better in the porn world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=311.7s)]
*  And now the depraved world that that lives in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=314.22s)]
*  is accessible by anyone with an internet connection. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's destroying not just families and marriages, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=320.98s)]
*  but now our young people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=324.66s)]
*  But why should we allow this as a society? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=326.98s)]
*  Why do we have to allow this as a society? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  Don't we have a duty to protect minors [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  from an industry that thrives on luring [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=333.98s)]
*  younger and younger people [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  into their darker and darker world? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=337.98s)]
*  For over 10 years, they were master groomers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=341.38s)]
*  I was intimidated. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=344.82s)]
*  They're standing over me saying, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=345.74s)]
*  sign here, sign here, initial here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=346.98s)]
*  And I'm like, can I read these? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=348.38s)]
*  From like 9 p.m. till four in the morning, I was raped. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=350.06s)]
*  I tried to run naked from the hotel room at one point. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=353.86s)]
*  And there was someone outside of the door. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=357.26s)]
*  And they're like, oh, then we'll put everything [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=359.26s)]
*  on the internet that we have right now with your full name, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  or we'll send it to your parents. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=365.22s)]
*  Do you want them to find out? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=366.54s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff that's happening online. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=368.98s)]
*  Finally, Americans are beginning to wake up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  The Texas state legislature passed HB 1181, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=375.1s)]
*  which requires age verification [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=378.86s)]
*  in order to access online sexual content. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  The law forced PornHub out of the state, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  a huge success in and of itself. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  But now that group is firing back [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  via another group called the Free Speech Coalition, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=392.5s)]

*  150 billion with a B. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=814.7s)]
*  If you're wondering, the Manhattan Project, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=817.98s)]
*  adjusted for inflation, only costs 30 billion. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=820.3s)]
*  The Panama Canal, 15 billion. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=823.46s)]
*  The Hoover Dam, 1 billion. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=826.0600000000001s)]
*  You don't need a PhD in economics [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=828.42s)]
*  to know we're getting ripped off. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=830.0999999999999s)]
*  Unless you don't have a brain above a single cell organism, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=832.18s)]
*  you know that there is waste in the federal government. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=836.66s)]
*  There's enormous waste. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=840.38s)]
*  Cutting waste up here is kind of like going to heaven. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=842.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, everybody wants to do it, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=845.54s)]
*  but nobody's quite ready to make the trip. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=847.78s)]
*  That was until today. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=851.54s)]
*  Trump finally got Elon out of Mar-a-Lago [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=853.26s)]
*  and sent him to Capitol Hill. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=856.14s)]
*  And he brought someone special. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=858.14s)]
*  And we're not talking about Vivek. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=860.1s)]
*  Elon, how's the meeting today? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=862.7s)]
*  Elon, how's the meeting today? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=866.22s)]
*  How do you win over people who say Doge doesn't have any power? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=870.74s)]
*  Elon, how do you define success for Doge? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=875.74s)]
*  Elon, do you want to see Democrats here? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=880.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=883.6999999999999s)]
*  Trump's taking a blowtorch to D.C. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=886.66s)]
*  The goal is to cut two trillion from the budget. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=889.14s)]
*  And if you're working from home, you're not working hard enough, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=892.66s)]
*  so pack your bags. Here's Vivek. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=894.8599999999999s)]
*  The idea of reducing the federal employee headcount [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=897.54s)]
*  is not really about saving cost. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=901.02s)]
*  Part of what you have is an overgrown federal government [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=902.7399999999999s)]
*  that is doing things that were never supposed to be done [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=905.4599999999999s)]
*  by the federal government in the first place. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=907.8199999999999s)]
*  You look at the number of times in the last two years alone, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=909.2199999999999s)]
*  or two to three years, that the action of a federal agency [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=912.3s)]
*  has been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=915.3s)]
*  So I think part of the project of thinning out [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=918.54s)]
*  the federal bureaucracy, that's less about the headcount expenses, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=920.9s)]
*  and it's more about actually respecting the rules of the road [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=924.18s)]
*  in the Constitutional Republic. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=926.9399999999999s)]
*  Doge is taking aim at illegal regulations. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=929.86s)]
*  And now the second richest man in the world is asking, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=932.9399999999999s)]
*  how can I help? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=935.66s)]
*  I'm very hopeful about this. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=937.58s)]
*  His... [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=939.78s)]
*  He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=942.02s)]
*  And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I'm going to help him. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=945.66s)]
*  Because we do have too much regulation in this country. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=949.46s)]
*  This is the most important thing, a growth mindset. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=952.54s)]
*  And we are the luckiest country in the world. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=955.5s)]
*  We have all these natural resources, including energy independence. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=957.74s)]
*  You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has too. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=961.9s)]
*  What I've seen so far is that... [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=964.7s)]
*  He is calmer than he was the first time, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=968.62s)]
*  and more confident, more settled. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=972.02s)]
*  The two richest men in the world are going to streamline the government [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=976.74s)]
*  to run it like a corporation. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=979.74s)]
*  And now the third richest man wants in. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=981.66s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg just made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=984.5799999999999s)]
*  to talk shop with Trump. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=987.66s)]
*  And everyone's on notice. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=989.86s)]
*  Executives from big pharma companies like Pfizer [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=991.86s)]
*  flew down to Mar-a-Lago this week to have dinner with Trump. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  And 47 brought a surprise guest. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  RFK Jr. came and sat down at the table with the big pharma executives [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1001.46s)]
*  so we can live fact check. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1006.46s)]
*  Besides Maha, another topic of discussion, a cure for cancer. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1008.86s)]
*  It was a three-hour dinner, probably because of the fact checking. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1013.66s)]
*  And as it wound down, we're told DJ Donald Trump [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1016.86s)]
*  pulled out his iPad and blasted Pavarotti. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1019.86s)]
*  Meanwhile at the FBI, agents are gearing up for a big clash with cash. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1023.26s)]
*  Mr. Patel, Trump's pick for director, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1028.26s)]
*  says he wants to turn the Hoover Building into a museum for the deep state. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1030.66s)]
*  And it's not going over very well. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1034.26s)]
*  I talked to a number of executives at headquarters [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1037.26s)]
*  who are absolutely... have already polished off their resume [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1042.66s)]
*  as soon as Trump was named as winner of the election. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1048.26s)]
*  And are out there actively pursuing other careers. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1052.86s)]
*  They're cheap concerning, what they're going to be keenly looking for, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1056.4599999999998s)]
*  and we should all be looking for as well, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  is the degree to which Patel in that position [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1060.4599999999998s)]
*  is going to impact the field offices. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1064.06s)]
*  The clash is going to occur rather immediately. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1065.86s)]
*  It's going to occur almost immediately. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1069.26s)]
*  And again, this desire to do away with civil service protections. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1071.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure the Agents Association and other law firms [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1074.6599999999999s)]
*  are ready to go on challenging that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1078.4599999999998s)]
*  Some governors are putting up a resistance. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1082.06s)]
*  Gavin Newsom says he wants to spend millions to Trump-proof California, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1084.26s)]
*  whatever that means. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1088.06s)]
*  Other Democrats are saying, cut it out. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1089.46s)]
*  I do wonder what that means, to Trump-proof a state. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1092.46s)]
*  Like, how do you Trump-proof a state in America? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1095.46s)]
*  Like, what happens when you need the president [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1098.46s)]
*  of the United States of America for something? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1100.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1102.46s)]
*  Like, I don't quite understand what that means. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1103.46s)]
*  Make it about the policies, because when you say things like Trump-proof, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1106.86s)]
*  you're going to end up looking like a hypocrite when, you know, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1109.66s)]
*  you need the president for something, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1111.8600000000001s)]
*  and you all in his face smiling and cheesing [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1113.66s)]
*  the same way, you know, President Biden was [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1115.66s)]
*  after they called him a threat to democracy and all of these other things, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1117.66s)]
*  and then he was like, welcome back! [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1120.66s)]
*  You know, when it came time for the White House. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1122.26s)]
*  When he came... So, it's like, cut it out. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1123.66s)]
*  Even Bill Clinton says, enough is enough. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1125.66s)]
*  I do think we should stop trying to criminalize politics. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1129.66s)]
*  But on the other... I think we should... both of us... [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1134.46s)]
*  Because... [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1138.46s)]
*  Because, obviously, and the people don't like it, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1140.46s)]
*  and they're not going along with it, from right to left. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1145.46s)]
*  Everyone's begging for mercy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1151.46s)]
*  Mexico, after getting threatened with a 25% tariff, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1153.46s)]
*  just seized a record haul of fentanyl from the Sinaloa cartel. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1156.46s)]
*  Trump hasn't even laid down the tariffs, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1161.46s)]
*  and Mexico's getting their act together. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1163.46s)]
*  Real men are back in D.C., [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1165.46s)]
*  and all the little critters are trying to clean up the mess [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1167.46s)]
*  before Dad comes home. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1170.46s)]
*  But they want to throw one last pardon palooza. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1172.46s)]
*  They want Biden to toss a pardon blanket over the entire Capitol. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1175.46s)]
*  Fauci, Jack Smith, Adam Schiff, even journalists. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1179.46s)]
*  These jokers haven't even asked for pardons. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1183.46s)]
*  Democrats are just assuming they'd want them [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1186.46s)]
*  because they know what they've done. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1188.46s)]
*  And Biden's thinking about it. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1190.46s)]
*  I think that they're taking every opportunity here [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1193.46s)]
*  to explore the options they have left [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1196.46s)]
*  in the time that they have left in office [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1198.46s)]
*  to protect people who may be subject to that attack. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1200.46s)]
*  So, yes, I think it's... I think it is absolutely [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1203.46s)]
*  a serious process they're undergoing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1205.46s)]
*  Biden's leaving office in the wake of pardons, orgies, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1208.46s)]
*  alcohol, empty office buildings, and bubble baths. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1211.46s)]
*  What a legacy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1215.46s)]
*  We are, and I say this for all of my colleagues in the front here, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1217.46s)]
*  we are Fox. We are different. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6JdfcDJR8&t=1220.46s)]
