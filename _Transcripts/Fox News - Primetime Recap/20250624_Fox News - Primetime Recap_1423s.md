# Fox News Highlights - June 23rd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E)
*  It's still America first. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=0.0s)]
*  Because of President Trump's decisive action in authorizing that B-2 bomber strike on Iran, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=7.84s)]
*  the regime there has been brought to its knees, agreeing to what will undoubtedly be a historic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=13.6s)]
*  ceasefire with Israel. Now, we're going to learn more of the specifics and the timing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=19.32s)]
*  of all this and bring all of that to you as the details come in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  But I thought now would be a good time to reemphasize two words, America first. The [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=28.22s)]
*  cornerstone of Trump's first two victories, of course, what set him apart from everyone [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=35.18s)]
*  else. Now think of how we arrived at this moment. The story of 20th century America [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=39.82s)]
*  is how we survived a dangerous period of wars and almost wars. And by the 80s under [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=47.7s)]
*  President Reagan, we became a nation with unparalleled military power and economic power. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=53.38s)]
*  It was peace through strength. Remember, Iran was so afraid of Reagan, they released the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=59.06s)]
*  52 hostages it was holding minutes after he was inaugurated. Then by the late 1980s, after [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=64.78s)]
*  two terms of Reagan, the USSR was driven to its knees. Just couldn't keep up with the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=71.48s)]
*  U.S. economic engine. Now, I was a young staffer at the White House back then when Gorbachev [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=76.42s)]
*  made his historic trip to Washington. The world was turning toward America. But then the 21st [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=82.14s)]
*  century tells a very different story, one where our leadership squandered what we'd built [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=89.82s)]
*  with stupid trade moves and stupid wars only to leave us adrift in a very dangerous world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=96.3s)]
*  Until that is Donald Trump came along. He told us it was time to get back to America first. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=102.86s)]
*  My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=111.14s)]
*  all else. Has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=119.06s)]
*  will make. America. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=130.34s)]
*  Remember the old establishment, they hated that. They were like, well, what is he talking about? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=141.58s)]
*  But his view, which was the correct one, it really resonated with people, is that you don't fight [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=146.58s)]
*  wars. You don't have to fight. Give peace a real chance. Diplomacy a real chance. Rebuild our own [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  country so we can remain free from foreign interference. He believes American strength [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=158.18s)]
*  shouldn't be wasted, but used wisely. So on Saturday, as our commander in chief with the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=163.38s)]
*  intel he was given, President Trump made this pivotal decision to move on Iran, believing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  doing so was in the best interest of our country, keeping us safe from Iran's nuclear tyranny. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=174.9s)]
*  For him was the ultimate putting America first. So can you imagine where it would be if Kamala were [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=180.34s)]
*  in the White House tonight? Oh my gosh, her crew would have had her dithering, appeasing, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=188.02s)]
*  and endless international meetings that generated nothing but meaningless joint statements. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  She would have had us rejoin that idiotic Iran nuclear deal that gave Iran the breathing room [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  it needed. She probably didn't even understand the significance of the billions of dollars [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=205.06s)]
*  released to Iran under Obama and Biden. And imagine taking advice, speaking of people you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  don't want to listen to, about any foreign policy matter, any advice whatsoever from this guy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=215.78s)]
*  This is very dangerous. My hope is that this is more performative than consequential [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=222.02s)]
*  and that it will satisfy their need to be able to respond. I think President Trump needs to clearly, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=229.78s)]
*  he'll be very judicious about measuring that and understanding it, and hopefully take the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  higher ground of getting back to the table for the simple reason that we don't have any visibility [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=245.06s)]
*  anymore. Okay, Grandma. Now, this should be a time where we all come together around this simple idea [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=252.58s)]
*  that the best path to keeping America safe, independent, free in the long term, is to ensure [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=260.82s)]
*  that we are as strong as possible as a nation. Because look, Iran is severely weakened by these [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=266.58s)]
*  strikes. They've agreed to this ceasefire, but there are still plenty of surrogates of Iran's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=274.5s)]
*  who may still want to do us harm. Undersecretary Pete Hegseth and General Dan Cain, our military [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=280.5s)]
*  has thankfully returned to its original mission to protect and defend our country. This is why [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=288.98s)]
*  recruiting is soaring in the military, because we are back to mission critical. I joined the president [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=294.66s)]
*  and the secretary in being incredibly proud of the air crews, naval forces, cyber operators, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=301.94s)]
*  planners and support teams and commanders who made this mission possible. It is their skill, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=308.5s)]
*  discipline and teamwork that makes this operation possible. I liked him in the Q&A. He's no nonsense. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=314.58s)]
*  But things could have gone in a very different direction, because this is where we were just a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=322.98s)]
*  few short years ago. Today, we're not here to be strong. We're not here to be courageous, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=327.7s)]
*  even though for so many of you, just coming to this event is an act of bravery. Today, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  we are here to find joy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=347.38000000000005s)]
*  I'll never forget the flag display there. What a travesty. The supreme leader was not hiding [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=353.54s)]
*  in a bunker during those years. Now look, the point is, if we're going to be engaged in more [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=361.70000000000005s)]
*  military actions, and I hope we aren't, then we will have to focus everything we've got on our [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  economy. And Trump knows this better than anyone, which means we should not be dependent on any [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=372.34s)]
*  foreign country, especially China, to supply us parts or computer chips or medicines. None of it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=377.78s)]
*  And it means Congress can't worship free trade over the need to rebuild our manufacturing base. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump's tariffs were and are brilliant. And no, costs aren't being passed on to the consumers, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  for the most part. The experts were wrong about that once again. Donald Trump's commitment [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=397.54s)]
*  to restoring America's industrial dominance, it's not just bold. It is absolutely necessary. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=404.5s)]
*  Yeah, some things in the short term may be a little bit more inconvenient, but in the long run, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  it means that we survive as an independent nation, not as a supplicant to China or anyone else. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  And beyond that, especially after tonight, we must be a country that loves itself again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=424.82s)]
*  Our schools should reinforce patriotism, not undermine it. If you're a teacher and you spend [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=432.1s)]
*  most of your class time grousing about America, you should be shown the door. We need to go back [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=437.62s)]
*  to a time when America did not rely on foreign workers or illegal labor, when our trade deficits [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=443.38s)]
*  weren't in the hundreds of billions of dollars, when our border was a given. President Trump knows [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=449.14s)]
*  that too. When even Hollywood would make the occasional feel good pro-American film. How about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=454.26s)]
*  that? And while we can't turn back time, I know everyone wants to sometimes or another, we can [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=459.86s)]
*  learn the hard lessons once and for all. America first, America always. And that's the angle. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=466.26s)]
*  Fox news alert. Trump says Iran and Israel have just agreed to a ceasefire and he expects it to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=479.14s)]
*  last forever, but it won't go into effect for 24 hours. He's going to let them each take one [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=486.74s)]
*  last shot at each other. Congratulations to everyone. It has been fully agreed by and between [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=492.9s)]
*  Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire in approximately six hours from [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=499.46s)]
*  now when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in-progress final missions. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=505.94s)]
*  For 12 hours, at which point the war will be considered ended officially, Iran will start [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=511.7s)]
*  the ceasefire and upon the 12th hour, Israel will start the ceasefire and upon the 24th hour, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=518.5s)]
*  an official end to the 12-day war will be saluted by the world. During each ceasefire, the other [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=525.3s)]
*  will remain peaceful and respectful on the assumption that everything works as it should, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=531.86s)]
*  which it will. I would like to congratulate both countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=537.86s)]
*  courage and intelligence to end what should be called the 12-day war. This is a war that could [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=544.1s)]
*  have gone on for years and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't and never will. JD [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=550.26s)]
*  Vance was just on with Brett. This is a great thing for Israel. Think about this. They've [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=557.54s)]
*  accomplished an important military objective. They've helped us destroy the Iranian nuclear [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=563.4599999999999s)]
*  program. They've also destroyed the conventional missile capability of Iran that threatened the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=568.5799999999999s)]
*  country of Israel. For the Iranians, I think this is a new opportunity to actually pursue the path [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=573.14s)]
*  of peace. As I said yesterday, what the Iranians have showed through their support of terror [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=578.0999999999999s)]
*  networks, through their now failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=582.3399999999999s)]
*  good at war. And I think the president really hit the reset button and said, look, let's actually [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=587.3s)]
*  produce long-term peace for the region. That's always been his goal. I actually think when we [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  look back, we will say the 12-day war was an important reset moment for the entire region. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=597.54s)]
*  Reuters is also reporting that Iran has officially agreed to the terms of the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=602.5799999999999s)]
*  ceasefire deal just hours after they fired missiles at American military bases in Qatar and Iraq. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=606.42s)]
*  Here's the launch. Watch. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=612.98s)]
*  The president confirmed 14 Iranian rockets were fired, saying 13 were knocked down and one was [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=633.0600000000001s)]
*  set free because it was headed in a non-threatening direction. 47 also confirming there were no [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=639.86s)]
*  casualties and hardly any damage was done. Trump calls it a very weak response, but most importantly, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=646.5s)]
*  they've gotten it all out of their system and there will be hopefully no further hate. I want [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=654.26s)]
*  to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=660.34s)]
*  to be injured. Thank you for your attention to this matter. So Trump got a heads up about the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=666.82s)]
*  Iranian attack because the Iranians didn't want American casualties. Our response would have been [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=671.94s)]
*  devastating, but the regime also had to do something to save face, especially so they can [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=677.38s)]
*  show the Iranian people that they're still in charge. So far, the mission's been flawless. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=683.62s)]
*  No American casualties. The bombs hit their targets. No real escalation so far and no mission [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=689.86s)]
*  creep yet. Trump gave the Iranians a deadline and he gave peace a chance, but the president [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=696.18s)]
*  felt like the Ayatollah gave him the middle finger, figuratively, when he refused to meet [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=702.7399999999999s)]
*  him in Turkey for face-to-face talks. And that came with a price. When the clock struck midnight [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=707.62s)]
*  Friday, B-2 bombers took off on a 37-hour flight, but they were prepared. These stealth bombers have [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=713.3s)]
*  bathrooms, mini fridges and microwaves. These guys flew from Missouri. They didn't land a single time. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=720.82s)]
*  They dropped 30,000-pound bombs on a target the size of a washing machine and then got back home [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=728.2600000000001s)]
*  safely without ever landing in the Middle East or ever stopping other than to briefly refuel. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=735.3000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they did that in the air. So it's really an incredible operation, a testament to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=741.86s)]
*  the power of American military. Operation Midnight Hammer has been in the works. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=746.1s)]
*  Last week Netanyahu asked the White House, how can we help? Trump said, clear the way for our [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=751.7s)]
*  bombers. The Israeli Air Force had a mission, eliminate as many Iranian air defense systems as [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=757.3000000000001s)]
*  possible. The Pentagon handed them a target list and they went to work. The Iranians had no idea [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  what was coming. There was nobody speaking about this, any of the preparations. There was a complete [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=769.22s)]
*  lockdown, almost a blackout of information for the last few days. That is a significant achievement [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=777.14s)]
*  because there was, there were no leaks about the timing. If you looked at the moon schedule, you [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=782.98s)]
*  might have had a clue because it was a waning crescent and almost a new moon on the 25th. So [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=788.74s)]
*  it would have been very, very dark over Iran tonight. Trump gave the final order on Marine One. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=795.78s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth called him when he was leaving Bedminster Saturday and said, the B-2s are about [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=802.5s)]
*  to reach the point of no return. Are we a go? And the president said, it's a go. The administration [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=807.54s)]
*  was confident their intelligence was rock solid. Are you saying there that the United States did [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=813.86s)]
*  not see intelligence that the Supreme Leader had ordered weaponization? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=820.34s)]
*  That's irrelevant. I see that question being asked on the media. That's an irrelevant question. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=827.46s)]
*  That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. You know that. No, it's not. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=831.22s)]
*  Yes, it was. The political decision had not been made. I know that better than you know that and I [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=834.9s)]
*  know that that's not the case. But I'm asking you whether the order was given. And the people who [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=838.82s)]
*  say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. They have everything they need to build [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=842.82s)]
*  nuclear weapons. Why would you bury, why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=846.58s)]
*  ground? Why would you bury six? Why do they have 60% enriched uranium? Why do they have a space [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=851.06s)]
*  program? Is Iran going to go to the moon? No. 47 flew back to Washington and oversaw the mission [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=855.54s)]
*  in the situation room. The president was joined by his national security team, Hegseth, Rubio, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=861.3s)]
*  Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Originally, a set of B-2s flew west to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=866.42s)]
*  Guam as a misdirection. The others continued east, each carrying bunker busters. A nuclear [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=873.14s)]
*  submarine in the Arabian Sea fired first. Two dozen tomahawks that took out Iranian defense systems. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=879.14s)]
*  Then the B-2s flanked by F-22s dropped 14 bunker busters onto three key targets. The main Iranian [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=885.9399999999999s)]
*  nuclear sites, which included the famous Fordow facility, buried deep underneath the mountain. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=894.1s)]
*  The U.S. commanders say all 14 bombs hit their targets, leaving nothing but smoking craters. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=899.94s)]
*  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Rezin Kaine, said the targets sustained [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=906.58s)]
*  severe damage and destruction. Trump said they were obliterated and were awaiting additional [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=911.62s)]
*  damage assessment. As the bombers left Iranian airspace, U.S. Navy assets fired tomahawks to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=917.3000000000001s)]
*  suppress anti-aircraft fire. All the pilots landed safely back in Missouri on Sunday night. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=924.02s)]
*  The president came out at 10 o'clock Saturday and called it a success. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=930.98s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight's was the most difficult of them all, by far, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=936.18s)]
*  and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=943.62s)]
*  those other targets with precision, speed, and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=949.54s)]
*  matter of minutes. The ceasefire announcement is a strong signal that the short war is winding down. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=957.14s)]
*  And we still have to wait and see what happens next. Iran's nuclear program has been set back [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=964.3399999999999s)]
*  years, possibly decades. Their top scientists and generals are all assassinated. Their leaders hiding [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=968.42s)]
*  in a bunker. And they're all alone in the world without proxies or allies. It could be too expensive [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=974.42s)]
*  for the Iranians to reconstitute their nuclear program. We don't know if they have other [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=980.66s)]
*  clandestine sites or whether they snuck enriched uranium out of the mountain before the attack. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=985.3s)]
*  But there's no doubt the regime's been significantly crippled. The Trump administration [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=990.8199999999999s)]
*  appears to have pulled off an incredible operation. And the American military, who lost a little [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=996.9799999999999s)]
*  prestige under President Biden, is back in a big way. American deterrence is back. This sends a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1002.74s)]
*  powerful message to China, Russia, and the cartels. And gives Trump even more power over [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1009.78s)]
*  trade negotiations. Other countries see that Trump is willing to go to the extreme for what he believes. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1015.78s)]
*  The market's up and oil prices are down. We hope any future fallout can be contained and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1023.0600000000001s)]
*  that American armed forces remain safe and the homeland is protected. In just 12 days, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1029.14s)]
*  President Trump in coordination with Israel and our Arab partners, he has totally reshaped the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1035.0600000000002s)]
*  future of the Middle East and the world. The naysayers, the isolationists were dead wrong. World War [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1041.46s)]
*  III is not happening. Instead, President Trump, he stood up to the worst bully terrorist nation in the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1046.74s)]
*  entire world and on the planet. And now peace is possible tonight. Thankfully, the Islamic Republic [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1052.18s)]
*  of Iran has been totally defanged. Their nuclear program has been obliterated. Their scientists are [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1058.34s)]
*  dead. Their top generals, many of them, are dead. Most of their missile systems have been destroyed. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1065.1399999999999s)]
*  Their proxies are in tatters. And the so-called elite Revolutionary Guard, they have been ripped [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1070.74s)]
*  to shreds with more top generals being killed by the Israelis. And after all of that, Iran is all [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1076.5s)]
*  of a sudden now ready to come to the table because they have no leverage at all whatsoever. This is [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1082.42s)]
*  what peace through strength, the Trump doctrine actually looks like. Can this be a lasting peace? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1088.5800000000002s)]
*  I can't give you that answer tonight. Only time will tell. Now, of course, it is possible as the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1094.1000000000001s)]
*  Iranian regime, they may simply be trying to buy time so they can rearm. The devil will be in the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1099.6200000000001s)]
*  details of a final deal and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Mideast envoy Steve Witcoff [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  are now in the process of hammering these issues out. Any deal obviously would insist on anyplace, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1112.66s)]
*  anywhere, anytime inspections. The Iranians need to stop providing money and weaponry to all of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1118.34s)]
*  their proxies. That means Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad. That would be the militias in Syria, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1124.18s)]
*  the militia in Iraq, and that would be the Houthi rebels. And frankly, they should recognize Israel's [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1131.54s)]
*  right to exist once and for all if we want a real and lasting peace. Or we will have to assume [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1138.58s)]
*  they simply want to build out a bigger, more lethal ballistic missile system. Remember, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1145.62s)]
*  they have ballistic missiles now at 2,000 pounds. They are looking and aiming to go to 4,000 pounds [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1150.8999999999999s)]
*  and they are firing those missiles into heavily populated areas. The fact that we can even discuss [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1156.8999999999999s)]
*  this tonight is only because of President Donald J. Trump. This is what Obama and Biden [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1162.42s)]
*  could and never would do with their policies of appeasement. Remember that included bribing [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1168.1000000000001s)]
*  the Iranians with billions of dollars in cash and other currency, being flown into Iran for the [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  mullahs of Iran in cargo planes, and in the case of Joe Biden not enforcing Donald Trump's sanctions [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1179.6200000000001s)]
*  that were bankrupting the Republic of Iran, their feckless diplomacy, their appeasement policies [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1186.26s)]
*  allowed the mullahs of Iran to get within weeks of a nuclear weapon. It allowed them to build out [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1192.74s)]
*  their weaponry and foment terror all throughout the region and the world and kill Americans. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1198.66s)]
*  And of course, they developed these facilities with all that money deep underground, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1203.94s)]
*  including the Fordow Nuclear Site that took years to build deep under this mountain that, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1208.9s)]
*  of course, is now obliterated. But tonight, one thing is clear to the entire world. The technology, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1214.66s)]
*  the logistics, the skill of the U.S. military is unmatched. No other country comes close. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1220.26s)]
*  After decades of being jerked around by and threatened by the Iranians, it took just a [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1226.5s)]
*  mere few hours for the USA to obliterate their nuclear ambitions. Over the weekend, nine B-2 [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1231.94s)]
*  stealth bombers launched from Missouri. Two were decoys that flew west. Seven others flew east [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1238.9s)]
*  over the Atlantic. And of course, these bombers were refueled midair, ultimately entered Iran's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1245.46s)]
*  airspace completely undetected. And according to my sources, the U.S. was even able to trigger [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1251.7s)]
*  false alerts and coordinates on Iran's air defense systems, causing them to shoot at what they [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1257.7s)]
*  thought were planes but was absolutely nothing in the sky. Incredible, you know, misdirection on the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1264.18s)]
*  part of our military. The bombers then dropped, as Jennifer Griffin said, 14 massive bunker buster [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1270.66s)]
*  bombs while a single submarine hundreds of miles away was able to deliver a payload of 30 Tomahawk [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1276.8200000000002s)]
*  cruise missiles. Deflection, precision, and ultimate perfection. None of the U.S. planes were fired [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1284.02s)]
*  upon. None of the munitions were intercepted. All of the targets were successfully hit. All was destroyed [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1290.42s)]
*  and all of our U.S. servicemen and women thankfully made it out of Iran's airspace. What is a very [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  difficult military operation, thankfully, thank God, safe and sound. Make no mistake, President Trump [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1305.0600000000002s)]
*  didn't just decimate Iran's nuclear ambitions. He sent a message the entire world was watching on [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1311.94s)]
*  Saturday night. The United States of America can hit any target at any time anywhere in the world [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1318.66s)]
*  with precision, with planes sitting on a tarmac in the middle of America. I promise you Russia, China, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1325.14s)]
*  North Korea, all of them were paying very close attention to what was unfolding on Saturday. And [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1331.94s)]
*  meanwhile, Iran's supposedly powerful allies, Russia, China, nowhere to be found. In fact, China [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1338.42s)]
*  even warned Iran not to block the strait, the Straits of Hormuz one day after Secretary of State [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1345.06s)]
*  Marco Rubio urged China to do just that. And thanks to President Trump, thanks to his team, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1351.62s)]
*  thanks to our amazing military men and women, American strength is back and better than ever [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1357.78s)]
*  and stronger than ever. And tonight the world is thankfully a safer place. As President Trump stated [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1363.06s)]
*  over and over and over again, and the Iranians would not listen, they must never and will never [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1369.22s)]
*  get a nuclear weapon. Promise made, promise kept. As for the peace deal, you got to give the president [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  a lot of credit for trying. Once again, Iran, they have another opportunity if they choose it for peace. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1381.22s)]
*  How about they start by recognizing Israel and stop providing their proxies, the weaponry, so [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1389.7s)]
*  they're fomenting terror, not only in the region, but around the world. Now only time will tell if [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1396.1s)]
*  they do, but trust, but verify peace through strength is now the foundation of President [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfKvcZMOU4E&t=1401.9399999999998s)]
