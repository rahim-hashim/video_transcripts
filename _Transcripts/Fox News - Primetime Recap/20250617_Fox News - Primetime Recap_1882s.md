# Fox News Highlights - June 16th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M)
*  Fox News alert Donald Trump leaving the G7 early and returning to Washington where he's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=0.0s)]
*  requesting the National Security Council be prepared in the situation room after a deadly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=13.84s)]
*  weekend in the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=19.16s)]
*  In Israel 24 fatalities 600 wounded the death count even higher in Iran 224 dead and counting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=21.0s)]
*  Iran retaliating by firing over 370 missiles at the Jewish state but Israel's hitting back [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=29.94s)]
*  harder. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=36.18s)]
*  Overnight Iranian missiles struck an Israeli oil refinery and a power grid this morning a state TV [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=59.94s)]
*  outlet in Tehran was bombed during a live broadcast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=77.46s)]
*  Tel Aviv is claiming full aerial superiority over Iranian airspace. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  They downed two Iranian fighter jets today after top Iranian military officials were taken out Friday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=102.0s)]
*  Israel says they've already destroyed a third of Iran's missile launchers and nuclear sites are getting pummeled so badly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=108.26s)]
*  that residents are being warned of radiation spillage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=115.7s)]
*  The IDF is warning that Iran will pay the price and they've scheduled this campaign to last two weeks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=118.94s)]
*  Their plan is to degrade the Iranian nuclear program and destroy their ballistic missile stockpiles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=125.9s)]
*  The mullahs are getting battered and they don't have the military capacity to trade endless missile strikes with Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=132.36s)]
*  They need a breather and are crossing their fingers that we don't provide the bunker busters that could eliminate their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  new sites deep underground. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  So they're begging Trump to come back to the negotiation table hoping that the U.S. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=147.08s)]
*  doesn't get involved militarily and that Netanyahu will take his finger off the trigger. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=151.52s)]
*  Trump signaling that he'd prefer a deal over death. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=156.84s)]
*  Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=161.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=168.46s)]
*  What have you heard? What have you heard from the Iranians? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=168.96s)]
*  They'd like to talk but they should have done that before. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days and on the 61st day I said we don't have a deal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  They have to make a deal and it's painful for both parties but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it's too late. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=190.28s)]
*  Democrats call Trump the taco president aka Trump always chickens out but he gave the Iranians a deadline for a deal [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=194.52s)]
*  and they missed the deadline so he let Netanyahu go at him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=202.52s)]
*  Now Iran's begging for mercy and they're not going to get a good of a deal now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=206.36s)]
*  The whole world witnessed that. That sends a strong message everywhere even on trade. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Now Iran's lost leverage. They're at their weakest point in decades. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=218.1s)]
*  Israel's neutralized their proxies. Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Assad in Syria. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=222.1s)]
*  The Iranians don't have much of a navy. Their air force is ancient. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  And their army's sitting ducks if they cross the border on foot into Iraq. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  They can't project power. The only thing keeping the Ayatollah alive is his nuclear program. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  And he's clinging on to it so that he doesn't get Qaddafi. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  Do you remember Qaddafi gave up his nuclear program and then Barack Hillary and the Europeans killed him anyway? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=245.76s)]
*  Trump says it's very simple. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=251.76s)]
*  I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran and we're well on our way to making sure that happens. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=255.76s)]
*  America can't let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon. Or any other country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=261.76s)]
*  Americans can't get blackmailed by rogue states. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=266.76s)]
*  And stopping the spread of nuclear weapons has been American policy since Oppenheimer made one. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=269.76s)]
*  Trump originally put NetYahu on ice and told him not to strike. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=274.9s)]
*  But NBC reports Trump had a change of heart after the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was cheating. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=279.9s)]
*  47 didn't want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=287.9s)]
*  So the Pentagon started to quietly move resources to the region. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=293.9s)]
*  Deploying reconnaissance aircraft to conduct surveillance and provide intelligence to Israel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=297.9s)]
*  Moved anti-drone and anti-missile systems from Ukraine to the Middle East. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  A carrier strike group from the Pacific to the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're assisting Israel with refueling flights. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  We're helping Israel intercept Iranian strikes and defending American soldiers and assets in the region. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  So you were closely coordinating with the U.S. throughout this process? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  Look, we're fully coordinated but understand that America under President Trump will make [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=327.18s)]
*  President Trump will make the decisions that are best for America. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=333.18s)]
*  And that's the way it is. He understands that I as the Prime Minister of Israel, the one and only Jewish state [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=336.18s)]
*  must make the decisions that are important for the survival of my country and he will do what is best for America. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=342.18s)]
*  That is a relationship of mutual respect and mutual confidence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=348.18s)]
*  Israel has its own agenda. They're looking out for their own interests. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=353.18s)]
*  And sometimes those interests align with ours and sometimes they don't. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=357.18s)]
*  Israel isn't interested in talks with Iran. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=361.18s)]
*  Netanyahu called the nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington fake. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=364.18s)]
*  Trump disagrees. He'd rather negotiate a settlement than settle it with airstrikes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=369.18s)]
*  Israel wants regime change. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=374.18s)]
*  Reports say Trump told Netanyahu no when they asked to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=378.18s)]
*  Officials say have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do, we're not even talking about going after the political leadership. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=383.32s)]
*  Bibi says Iran tried to kill Trump. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=393.32s)]
*  These people who chant death to America try to assassinate President Trump twice. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=397.32s)]
*  Do you want these people to have nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to your cities? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=402.32s)]
*  Of course not. So we're defending ourselves but we're also defending the world. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=407.32s)]
*  You just said Iran tried to assassinate President Trump twice. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=411.46s)]
*  Do you have intel that the assassination attempts on President Trump were directly from Iran? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=416.46s)]
*  Through proxies, yes. Through their intel, yes. They want to kill him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=421.46s)]
*  Well, we know Iran tried to kill Trump but we never knew Ruth and Crooks were Iranian proxies. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=427.46s)]
*  Either Netanyahu just shared intelligence that hasn't been shared with the American people or he's spinning. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=435.46s)]
*  Remember, there's always propaganda when missiles are flying. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=441.46s)]
*  And as critical as it is to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, we've seen the risks of regime change. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=445.46s)]
*  What comes next is the question. Iran's a theocracy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=451.46s)]
*  You can take out the Ayatollah but there's still 30,000 radical clerics. You can't kill them all. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=456.46s)]
*  So who takes over after a decapitation strike? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=462.46s)]
*  Someone even more dangerous? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=465.46s)]
*  Does the country disintegrate into militia infighting? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=467.46s)]
*  Do insurgents take over the oil sector? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  Do jihadists pour in from all over the world and force Iranian refugees to pour out? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  And then who takes them? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel doesn't have to manage that chaos. That'll fall to the United States. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  We've overthrown Iranian leaders before. We installed the Shah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  And he was a great ally against the Soviets and kept the oil flowing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  But he was so unpopular there was a revolution. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  And these fundamentalists took over. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  Their paramilitary groups laid siege to the region and they started enriching uranium. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=499.74s)]
*  It's who we're dealing with now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=504.74s)]
*  You never really know what happens after you topple a leader. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=507.74s)]
*  You'd rather have ships sailing from Europe to the Indian Ocean without any trouble. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=510.74s)]
*  So far oil prices haven't spiked too much. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=515.74s)]
*  Oil in the 60s is what's kept inflation at bay this year. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=518.74s)]
*  Let's keep it that way. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=522.74s)]
*  There's two key things to look for to tell you how this conflict's going to play out. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=524.74s)]
*  If the Israelis start targeting Iranian oil refineries, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=529.74s)]
*  that could tell you regime change could be next. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=533.74s)]
*  Because a domestic energy crisis will turn the streets against Iranian leadership. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=536.74s)]
*  And also look for whether bunker busters will be used. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=541.74s)]
*  Israel has them, but they don't go as deep as the American ones. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=545.74s)]
*  And if the U.S. delivers them to Israel or uses them ourselves, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=549.74s)]
*  that'll cripple the only card Iranians have left. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=553.74s)]
*  And could lead to the Iranians lashing out wildly in a last-ditch effort to preserve their power. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=555.88s)]
*  Or it could force them to sign a settlement where they swear off enrichment. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=561.88s)]
*  Or the settlement opens up their country for inspections so invasive [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=566.88s)]
*  that it makes it almost impossible for the regime to retain legitimacy [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=572.88s)]
*  and hurts their ability to control their own population, which is their main goal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=576.88s)]
*  At that point, you could have a revolution. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=580.88s)]
*  Or anything could happen. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=583.88s)]
*  This is a fast-moving story. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=585.88s)]
*  Trump just posted on Truth Social, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=587.88s)]
*  everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=590.88s)]
*  This country elected President Trump because they trust him as commander-in-chief, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=594.88s)]
*  more than they trusted Joe Biden, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=599.88s)]
*  and much more than they would have trusted Kamala Harris. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=601.88s)]
*  One of the reasons he won the Republican primary in 16 [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=604.88s)]
*  was because he called the Iraq War dumb. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=608.88s)]
*  But Trump has also shown his willingness to take strong and decisive action to eliminate foreign threats. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=611.02s)]
*  So far the risks to American soldiers have been minimal, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=618.02s)]
*  and we hope it stays that way. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=622.02s)]
*  Because if we can achieve a peaceful solution to the Iranian issue, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=624.02s)]
*  the rest of the President's Mideast agenda falls into place. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=628.02s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, low energy prices, free shipping lanes, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=632.02s)]
*  and an AI market that relies on U.S. tech. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=636.02s)]
*  We can then finally pivot to Asia, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=638.16s)]
*  and back here to the homeland, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=641.16s)]
*  to confront more immediate challenges. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=643.16s)]
*  Also tonight, thus far, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=646.16s)]
*  Israel's air campaign, it has been a massive success. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=648.16s)]
*  According to multiple reports, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=651.16s)]
*  the mullahs of Iran are now begging for new negotiations. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=653.16s)]
*  One report not confirmed has a supreme leader negotiating asylum, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=656.16s)]
*  possibly with Putin and Russia. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=662.16s)]
*  Almost all of their top military commanders, they are now dead. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=664.16s)]
*  Their top nuclear scientists, they are also dead. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=666.3s)]
*  Their ability to fire ballistic missiles, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=669.3s)]
*  as you just heard from Trey Yankst, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=672.3s)]
*  that is diminishing by the hour. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=674.3s)]
*  Their weaponry slowly being depleted and degraded. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=676.3s)]
*  Their nuclear aspirations, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=679.3s)]
*  they are quickly coming to an end, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=681.3s)]
*  which is good for mankind. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=683.3s)]
*  As President Trump has emphasized over and over and over again, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=685.3s)]
*  and he tried hard, he fought hard for peace, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=689.3s)]
*  Iran cannot, in the end, have a nuclear weapon, period, end of sentence. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  and we're well on our way to making sure that happens. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, that would be the Trump doctrine. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  I fully, completely support this doctrine, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  as the President wrote on Truth Social. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  America first means many great things, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  including the fact that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=718.58s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=722.58s)]
*  The President also made one other point very clear. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=724.58s)]
*  If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=727.58s)]
*  the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=730.58s)]
*  will come down on you at levels never seen before. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=733.58s)]
*  In the meantime, it appears that Israel's air campaign, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=736.58s)]
*  now with full air superiority, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=739.58s)]
*  they own the Iranian skies, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=742.58s)]
*  achieved in just four days, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=744.58s)]
*  will only be ramping up at this point. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=745.72s)]
*  They own the skies, they have all the leverage. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=748.72s)]
*  But let's be clear, this conflict, any conflict, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=751.72s)]
*  is not without risk, it is not without hardship, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=754.72s)]
*  it is not without suffering. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=757.72s)]
*  Also, part of the Trump doctrine is no more forever wars. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=759.72s)]
*  I fully agree with that also. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=762.72s)]
*  With Israel owning the air over the entire country of Iran, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=764.72s)]
*  the country now is suspect. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=768.72s)]
*  They're going to lose the nuclear program. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=771.72s)]
*  That is pretty abundantly clear tonight. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=773.72s)]
*  But they could also lose their electric grid, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=775.72s)]
*  which is gas driven. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=778.72s)]
*  That could be taken out just as quickly. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=780.72s)]
*  All their refineries, which is their entire economy, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=783.72s)]
*  can also be taken out. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=786.72s)]
*  And without a protracted war or boots on the ground, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=788.72s)]
*  doesn't make it risk free. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=792.72s)]
*  Everything has risk. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=794.72s)]
*  However, the President is correct. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=796.72s)]
*  The greater risk would be to do nothing [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=798.72s)]
*  in the face of a clear and present danger. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=800.72s)]
*  The world cannot experience another holocaust. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=802.72s)]
*  Iran has proven over and over again, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=805.72s)]
*  convert or die, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=808.72s)]
*  And as the President repeats, over and over again, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=811.72s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=814.72s)]
*  Just noticed how Israel hits military targets. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=816.72s)]
*  And look what the Iranians are doing. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=819.72s)]
*  They are terrorizing heavy populated civilian areas [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=821.72s)]
*  like Tel Aviv. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=824.72s)]
*  Imagine the region with a nuclear armed Iran, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=826.72s)]
*  the number one state sponsor of terror, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=829.72s)]
*  pledging to wipe Israel and the US off the map, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=831.72s)]
*  fighting proxy war after proxy war after proxy war. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=833.86s)]
*  I brought this up last week. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=836.86s)]
*  Ask yourself, how many rockets, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=838.86s)]
*  if they were fired into our country [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=840.86s)]
*  by the number one sponsor of terror, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=842.86s)]
*  and they were threatening to wipe us off the map, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=844.86s)]
*  how many rockets would it take [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=847.86s)]
*  before every American demanded a military response [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=849.86s)]
*  from their government? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=853.86s)]
*  Israel now for decades has been the target of tens, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=855.86s)]
*  not hundreds of thousands of rocket attacks [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=858.86s)]
*  Now the ballistic missiles, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=862.0s)]
*  they are getting more powerful than ever. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=864.0s)]
*  2,000 pounds, and the Iranians, according to reports, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=866.0s)]
*  they want 4,000 pound ballistic missiles. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=869.0s)]
*  That can cause a lot of damage in a city like Tel Aviv. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=872.0s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=875.0s)]
*  What would you want a US President to do? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=877.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what Israel is facing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=880.0s)]
*  Iran wanted to wipe the world's only Jewish state off the map [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=883.0s)]
*  and with each passing day, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=886.0s)]
*  the Islamic Republic was getting closer and closer [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=888.0s)]
*  to achieving that goal. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=890.14s)]
*  During both the Obama and Biden years, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=892.14s)]
*  Iran was able to do pretty much whatever they wanted. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=895.14s)]
*  I blame both of them for enriching the uranium. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=897.14s)]
*  I blame both of them, especially Biden, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=900.14s)]
*  turning a blind eye to the sanctions [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=903.14s)]
*  that were bankrupting him [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=905.14s)]
*  that Donald Trump had put in place. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=907.14s)]
*  They stockpiled thousands of ballistic missiles. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=909.14s)]
*  They were able to use that money [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=911.14s)]
*  to foment terror all over the region [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=913.14s)]
*  and build out their nuclear program [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=915.14s)]
*  and enrich uranium at a far lower cost. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=917.14s)]
*  They were able to do that at a far more rapid pace. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=920.14s)]
*  They've armed their proxies to the teeth [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=923.14s)]
*  all while declaring what they want, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=925.14s)]
*  what their stated goal is. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=927.14s)]
*  And while Israel has neutralized Iran's top proxies, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=929.14s)]
*  the nuclear program, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=932.14s)]
*  the country's missile production capabilities, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=934.14s)]
*  they were picking up speed. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=936.14s)]
*  In about a month, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=938.14s)]
*  a nuclear holocaust would have been a real possibility. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=940.14s)]
*  That is not a risk that any country should ever have to face. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=942.14s)]
*  Unfortunately, the so-called party of compassion [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=946.14s)]
*  doesn't seem to care. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=948.28s)]
*  In fact, the base of the Democratic Party, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=950.28s)]
*  others with extreme views, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=952.28s)]
*  they seem perfectly okay with the virulent anti-Semitism [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=954.28s)]
*  in the halls of Congress, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=956.28s)]
*  on college campuses, and worldwide. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=958.28s)]
*  And, you know, from the river to the sea, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=960.28s)]
*  how often have we heard that? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=962.28s)]
*  Or, at best, they wouldn't mind if it did happen. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=964.28s)]
*  In fact, tonight, left-wing protesters [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=966.28s)]
*  in New York City openly supporting Iran. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=968.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=970.28s)]
*  Do you condone or condemn the missiles [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=972.28s)]
*  that were used against the people of Iran? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=974.28s)]
*  Do you condone or condemn the missiles on Israel? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=975.42s)]
*  Condone! [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=979.42s)]

*  this February. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  He has a grotesquely yellow head. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1149.7s)]
*  And just like mom, he now weighs 16 pounds. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1151.7s)]
*  Of course, as you know, I just had a baby too. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1153.7s)]
*  But cat, being competitive as always, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1155.7s)]
*  she had to do one better [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1157.7s)]
*  and got diagnosed with cancer. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1159.7s)]
*  Which makes my ringworm [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1161.7s)]
*  seem pretty lame in comparison. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1163.7s)]
*  But I'm going to tell you a story [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1165.7s)]
*  that I've never heard before. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1167.7s)]
*  I was in the hospital [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1169.7s)]
*  and I was diagnosed with cancer. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1171.7s)]
*  And I was diagnosed with a cancer [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1173.7s)]
*  that I had never seen before. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1175.7s)]
*  And I was diagnosed with a cancer [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1177.7s)]
*  that I had never seen before. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1179.7s)]
*  So okay, cat, you win. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1181.7s)]
*  And in a way she did. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1183.7s)]
*  Doctors caught her cancer [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1185.7s)]
*  just hours before she went into labor [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1187.7s)]
*  through a checkup she wouldn't have had [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1189.7s)]
*  if she wasn't pregnant. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1191.7s)]
*  Fact is, if she hadn't had the baby, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1193.7s)]
*  she wouldn't have known she had cancer. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1195.7s)]
*  And she wouldn't have had the surgery [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1197.7s)]
*  to remove the cancer. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1199.7s)]
*  So for you keeping score, cat had sex [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1201.7s)]
*  which in getting pregnant cured her cancer. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1203.7s)]
*  Meaning, sex cures cancer. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1205.7s)]

*  Okay. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1269.98s)]
*  You mad at me? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1271.98s)]
*  Was it something I said? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1273.98s)]
*  Something I did? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1275.98s)]
*  Is it about the thing I left in the bathroom? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1277.98s)]
*  Am I in trouble? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1279.98s)]
*  Am I fired? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1281.98s)]
*  I guess I'm fired. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1283.98s)]
*  Should I just get my things? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1285.98s)]
*  I'll come when you're not there. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1287.98s)]
*  I guess this is it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1289.98s)]
*  I knew this would happen. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1291.98s)]
*  You never liked me, but I never liked you either. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1293.98s)]
*  Sorry about that last text. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1295.98s)]
*  I didn't mean it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1297.98s)]
*  Can I have my job back? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1299.98s)]
*  Okay, I'll send Cam to box up my things. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1301.98s)]
*  If it's okay, I'd like to take my Ron Paul coffee mug. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1303.98s)]
*  I just hope that someday I can use you [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1305.98s)]
*  as a reference at Boston Market. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1307.98s)]
*  Of course, then I finally respond, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1309.98s)]
*  Hey, cat, what's up? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1311.98s)]
*  I was just taking a dump. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1313.98s)]
*  So that's cat, but not in a nutshell. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1315.98s)]
*  Because it's the huge stuff she tackles without complaint. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1319.98s)]
*  Truthfully, if we couldn't see that she was pregnant, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1322.98s)]
*  she wouldn't have been known. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1325.98s)]
*  She treated it the way most guys treat a groin pool. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1327.98s)]
*  And cancer and the surgeries that followed. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1329.98s)]
*  I haven't seen a person dive head into battle like that in a while. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1332.98s)]
*  She tackled that head on like Joy Behar shoving aside security [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1335.98s)]
*  at a KFC grand opening. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1339.98s)]
*  No wonder cat has a cat that is 15 years old. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1341.98s)]
*  Jeans and simply staying alive to prove he has more lives than her. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1347.98s)]
*  So you could credit this character of cats to her Detroit origins. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1351.98s)]
*  But she's as American as baseball, apple pie, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1355.98s)]
*  and sending hate mail to Brian Kilmeade. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1358.98s)]
*  Yeah, we do sweat the small stuff. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1360.98s)]
*  We complain about traffic, the news, nuclear war. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1364.98s)]
*  But when faced with big stuff, we're always up for the fight. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1367.98s)]
*  And so is cat, as she offers us this heartwarming message [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1370.98s)]
*  before undergoing cancer surgery. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1373.98s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1375.98s)]
*  So, cat is someone who always has your back, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  even when you don't text her back. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  So we're super happy cat's returned. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  We missed her dearly. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1387.1200000000001s)]
*  We know the future will still be hard for her. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  There will be other hurdles, I'm sure. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  But we have faith in her as much as I hope she has faith in us. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  To be here when things get rough or when things get better, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  but she still complains. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  So please welcome cat back and congratulate her on her success. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1404.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  So please welcome cat back and congratulate her for kicking out a baby [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1407.26s)]
*  and kicking cancer's ass. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1411.26s)]

*  Yeah, I remember before I left, I didn't get stretch marks. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1469.5400000000002s)]

*  as you know, you mentioned, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1493.5400000000002s)]

*  because like I didn't want to risk my life [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1501.5400000000002s)]
*  for some 32 ways. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1503.5400000000002s)]

*  the way that it happened, it really was truly insane. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1517.5400000000002s)]
*  I really had a day between the cancer diagnosis [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1519.68s)]
*  and the labor. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1523.68s)]
*  We don't know for sure what happened. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1525.68s)]
*  I could have gotten cancer because I was pregnant [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1527.68s)]
*  and even if I did, I, he's still so worth it [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1529.68s)]
*  because I love him so much. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1531.68s)]
*  And I know that's so cheesy and I know that's so gross [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1533.68s)]
*  and I used to hear people say that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1536.68s)]
*  and I was like, how am I, can't imagine my life [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1538.68s)]
*  without him and I used to want to throw up on them [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1540.68s)]
*  but now I'm one of those people. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1542.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1544.68s)]
*  You know what? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1545.68s)]
*  It's a, it's called a transformational experience [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1547.68s)]
*  and you can't imagine yourself what it's like. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1549.68s)]
*  No, I couldn't. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1551.68s)]
*  I really, really couldn't and honestly, I thank you to all. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1553.68s)]

*  And everybody also who's, you know, said nice things, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1574.68s)]
*  it's been really great [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1576.68s)]
*  but I do want to clear one thing up too also [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1577.8200000000002s)]
*  that sometimes there have been times [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1579.8200000000002s)]
*  when you have not texted me back [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1581.8200000000002s)]
*  when you have been mad at me. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1583.8200000000002s)]

*  You did a great job by the way. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1603.8200000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1605.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1606.96s)]
*  I'm just trying not to cry [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1608.96s)]
*  because like I've been looking forward to this day for her for so long. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1610.96s)]
*  I know, I'm trying to hold because then I'm going to say. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1612.96s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1614.96s)]
*  I won't cry. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1616.96s)]
*  What you said is so perfect because she is so hysterically neurotic. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1618.96s)]
*  When she found out she was pregnant, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1620.96s)]
*  she sent me a screenshot of five pregnancies. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1622.96s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't believe it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1624.96s)]
*  She was like, I only told my sister, I'm going to go take 20 more. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1626.96s)]
*  But she was one of those people who was so easy peasy through all of that. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1628.96s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go take 20 more. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1630.96s)]
*  But she was one of those people who was so easy peasy through all of that. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1632.96s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go take 20 more. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1634.96s)]
*  And then she went into labor throughout pregnancy. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1636.96s)]
*  She had the scare at the end. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1638.96s)]
*  And you know, she called me when she had, you know, the horrible news that the test for cancer was positive. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1640.96s)]
*  And then went into labor a few hours later and then handled labor like a champion. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1646.96s)]
*  And they kept trying to convince her. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1652.96s)]
*  I don't know if I can say this. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1654.96s)]
*  I did it out if I can. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1656.96s)]
*  That she should have a c-section. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1658.96s)]
*  She was like, no, absolutely not. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1660.96s)]
*  I'm having this baby. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1662.96s)]
*  They had to do things that were so incredibly painful. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1664.96s)]
*  And I think that's a moment and she's just absolutely, truly incredible. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1666.96s)]
*  And for her to be here today with the sense of humor that she has, let me give you a quick story. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1670.96s)]
*  So she and Cam are raising their child on their own. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1675.96s)]
*  They don't have a night nurse or a nanny. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1679.96s)]
*  They're really just a beautiful family. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1681.96s)]
*  So she was on the couch with her sister, Julia, and the baby pooped. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1683.96s)]
*  And she was like, Cam, Cam, can you please change the baby? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1688.96s)]
*  And you hear Cam in the other room. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1692.96s)]
*  I changed him last time. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1694.96s)]
*  It's your turn to change his diaper. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1696.1000000000001s)]
*  And she goes, Cam, I have cancer. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1698.1000000000001s)]
*  Nice. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1704.1000000000001s)]
*  I think you can milk that for a while. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1706.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you got to. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1708.1000000000001s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1710.1000000000001s)]
*  David, you're a comedian, a veteran comedian. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1712.1000000000001s)]
*  Can you fashion some jokes out of this material? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1716.1000000000001s)]
*  Or at least plug your Western razor company? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1719.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that'll happen. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1721.1000000000001s)]
*  But I just want to say what a great person Cat is because she, you know, in the height of it all, cancer, newborn baby, she did come over and gave me the phone charger. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1722.24s)]
*  You know? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1734.24s)]
*  I didn't want to go, you know, I didn't want to go over, she came over to my, it was just easier for me. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1736.24s)]
*  It was easier for me. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1743.24s)]
*  But yeah, you know, she's a strong woman and like a lot of strong women, you know, we have a new line of products now that are, you know, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1745.24s)]
*  aim for just for her, you know? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1750.38s)]
*  American made razors, they're no longer just for men. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1754.38s)]
*  Check it out at westernraiser.com. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1757.38s)]
*  Nicely done. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1759.38s)]
*  All right, Tyrus, last word. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1761.38s)]
*  Your partner in crime is back. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1763.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1765.38s)]
*  It has been horrible. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1767.38s)]
*  Thank God you're back. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1769.38s)]
*  But I would like to say one thing. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1771.38s)]
*  I think, and again, I think Kennedy needs to be a permanent member of our team. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1773.38s)]
*  She needs to be a permanent member of our team. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1777.38s)]
*  She needs to be part of the Gut Felt Show. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1778.5200000000002s)]
*  Because not only did you carry the weight, you also did it, which is so rare in this business, as a friend, as a partner, like you were just there for her. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1780.5200000000002s)]
*  And entertainment is an ugly business, you know? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1792.5200000000002s)]
*  And you refused and it was a beautiful thing and it was really good to think. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1795.5200000000002s)]
*  But I'm really excited because I finally got to meet Big Ben. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1799.5200000000002s)]
*  And that's my nickname because one of the pictures I took was of her. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1803.5200000000002s)]
*  And I said, oh, Big Ben, that's my nickname because one of the pictures I got, he was the same length as a watch. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1806.66s)]
*  And I said, oh, Big Ben, that's my guy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1811.66s)]
*  And finally I got to meet and I said, there wasn't going to be any problems with me and Big Ben because he heard my voice for the last eight months. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1814.66s)]
*  And when I saw him in there, it was like we just picked, you would have thought, I mean, obviously the skin tone is off so he wasn't mine. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1822.66s)]
*  But I was holding him, we were playing, I was getting kisses, he pulled my beard. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1828.66s)]
*  I pulled your beard a lot. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1832.66s)]
*  And then we both made the same look. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1833.8000000000002s)]
*  And so I didn't get a chance to give you a gift, but I have a gift for Big Ben. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1835.8000000000002s)]
*  Because every young man starting out in the world needs to have, now he can't have it right now, you got to wait. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1840.8000000000002s)]
*  But he needs to have his own Godzilla. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1845.8000000000002s)]
*  So this is for Big Ben's first, this is Big Ben's first action figure. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1847.8000000000002s)]
*  Not a doll. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1852.8000000000002s)]
*  This ain't girl stuff. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1854.8000000000002s)]
*  This is an active figure for Big Ben. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1856.8000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Tyrus. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1858.8000000000002s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1860.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, that's sweet. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1861.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry, were you born? Do you have cancer? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1862.94s)]
*  Yeah, where's your cancer? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1864.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsBpshItD2M&t=1866.94s)]
