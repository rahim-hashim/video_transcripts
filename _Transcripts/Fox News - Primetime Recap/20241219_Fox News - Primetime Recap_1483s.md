# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 18, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98)
*  And that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=0.0s)]
*  If it's a week before Christmas, it's time for Congress's annual spending farce known [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=11.36s)]
*  as a continuing resolution. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=16.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be about keeping government operations open and providing disaster relief [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=18.28s)]
*  aid to hurricane victims, which I'm sympathetic to. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=22.62s)]
*  If you read the bill carefully, it contains pay raises for members of Congress. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=25.2s)]
*  And I'm not making this up, an expansion of their federal health benefits. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=30.28s)]
*  It contains all kinds of special interests and pork funding, including opening up a new [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=33.78s)]
*  stadium in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  It renews the Global Engagement Center, which is a key node of the censorship industrial [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=40.24s)]
*  complex. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=44.96s)]
*  And President Trump weighed in tonight on Truth Social, saying any Republican that would [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  be so stupid as to do this and will be primaried. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=51.8s)]
*  Everything should be done and fully negotiated prior to my taking office on January 20th. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=57.04s)]
*  Now, I know why Congress hasn't gotten a raise in 15 years, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=63.4s)]
*  They haven't gotten a raise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=69.16s)]
*  It's in this actual legislation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=70.38s)]
*  But do they deserve a raise? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  How many have made huge money trading stocks using their inside info? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  They've dug us into a $37 trillion hole. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=82.68s)]
*  But at least Senator Schumer's happy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  There are many good things in this bill that Democrats worked hard for and achieved. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=88.92s)]
*  Democrats have insisted these agreements must not have cuts, and this bill has no cuts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=97.36s)]
*  Of course he's ecstatic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=103.4s)]
*  His staff probably wrote much of it, at least the liberal goodies inside, and all of those [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=105.22s)]
*  little IEDs in the text blowing up on us, such as the provision that makes it even easier [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=110.94s)]
*  for the government to conceal info about the rigged January 6th Congressional investigation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=121.42s)]
*  J.D. Vance knows this all too well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=122.62s)]
*  It's a shell game. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=124.58s)]
*  And he lambasted the process, urging Republicans to pass a temporary funding bill without Democrat [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=125.78s)]
*  giveaways. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=131.18s)]
*  He also spoke out about what President Trump wants in the bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=132.44s)]
*  What the president believes is we should support a clean CR so long as it contains a debt limit [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=135.88s)]
*  increase. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=141.68s)]
*  That's the position of the president, and that's what we're going to try to push for. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=142.68s)]
*  Well tonight we can report that it looks like the pressure may be working. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=146.72s)]
*  The House adjourned late today, and word from Chad Pergram is that this CR is effectively [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=151.92s)]
*  DOA. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=157.18s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=158.18s)]
*  This is great news if it is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=160.34s)]
*  Now is the time to set the table for 2025. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=162.44s)]
*  That's what Trump and Vance are alluding to here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=165.74s)]
*  The voters want practical solutions to the problems bearing down on us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=168.76s)]
*  And nothing about this CR and the process by which it arrived on our doorsteps is practical. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Will Democrats refuse to go with a clean, clean bill? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=180.54s)]
*  Will they force a partial government shutdown before Christmas, then hope the Republicans [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=182.9s)]
*  get the blame? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=187.02s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=188.26s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=189.26s)]
*  Make them defend their game of smoke and mirrors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=190.94s)]
*  Right about now, sane people watching tonight are asking, what is the reason for this yearly [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=195.6s)]
*  last minute spend-a-palooza? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=201.66s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=203.14s)]
*  Because there are about 300 members in the House who like it this way. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=205.92s)]
*  A last minute bill stuffed with a lot of pork, no real time to read it, no need to defend [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=209.48s)]
*  it, where deals are cut to spend money we don't have or projects we don't need. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=214.38s)]
*  That's perfect. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=218.82s)]
*  We're just fundamentally on serious about spending. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=219.82s)]
*  As long as you've got a blank check, you can't shrink government. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=222.1s)]
*  If you can't shrink government, you can't live free. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  Forty-three days ago, the American people gave us a mandate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=226.14s)]
*  Why in the world, days before we swear in on January 3rd, are we going to work with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=229.62s)]
*  all the Democrats to pass all of this pork? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=234.7s)]
*  And you can't just blame Democrats, though. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they still control the Senate, and that's a problem. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=241.7s)]
*  But plenty of Republicans have gotten used to this game as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=244.1s)]
*  Despite all the conservative foot-stopping about the need to cut spending, there are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=248.42s)]
*  usually only a few dozen members willing to blow the whistle on what's becoming institutionalized [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  taxpayer theft. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=257.82s)]
*  Buried in the CR is a pay raise for lawmakers. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=260.02s)]
*  Do you think that Congress deserves a raise? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=262.78s)]
*  Not the way it's acting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  Are you going to vote for the CR? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  Nope. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=268.62s)]
*  It doesn't send the right message. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=269.62s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=271.34s)]
*  We should be cutting spending everywhere. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=272.62s)]
*  That's really the truth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=274.5s)]
*  I had no vote before I even got on an airplane and even knew what came into town and even [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=275.5s)]
*  knew what was in the bill. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=279.38s)]
*  I do not think we've done anything to deserve a pay raise. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=280.38s)]
*  We're the only job in the world where we can just arbitrarily create more funding and just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=283.22s)]
*  steal from our great-grandchildren. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=289.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, the one's voting for this to get some coal in their stocking, at the very [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=291.3s)]
*  least. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=296.42s)]
*  But now, maybe with Trump back, more will stand up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=297.62s)]
*  And they should. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=300.74s)]
*  Think about the American families, what they do with their budgets every month. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=302.14s)]
*  If you're responsible, you give yourself a certain percentage to spend on extras after [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=305.94s)]
*  you take care of essentials. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=310.98s)]
*  If you care about your credit rating, you don't spend more than you make, especially [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=312.8s)]
*  when you've already got outstanding loans that you haven't paid off. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  If you want to rest easy, you're not just spending either. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=320.74s)]
*  You're saving as well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=324.74s)]
*  But Congress doesn't follow those common sense rules. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  But this madness cannot continue. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=330.28s)]
*  For the first time, the interest we pay on the debt is more than we spend on our national [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  defense. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=338.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's edging up to $1 trillion in interest payments. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=339.11999999999995s)]
*  This is crazy town. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump's team, once they're fully in charge, will be on a wartime footing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=346.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm calling it wartime. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  Because they're battling to expose this twisted process and give us very specific areas that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  need to be cut. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=357.44s)]
*  This time, Trump will have the added help in the bully pulpit with Vance and Musk and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=359.6s)]
*  Vivek and others. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  The pressure on Congress to change their ways will be hard to resist. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  And Speaker Johnson, with an even slimmer majority this year, wow, will absolutely need [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=371.56s)]
*  the Doge magic. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=377.14000000000004s)]
*  Going into 2026, the GOP needs to keep broadening its coalition, but also please elect fiscal [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=379.44s)]
*  conservatives. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  As of now, too many have drunk the swamp water. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=387.74s)]
*  That's a new drink. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  We should call that up at the bar. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=394.94s)]
*  Christmas is only a week away. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=395.94s)]
*  And while you're out doing last minute shopping, so is Congress. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=397.76s)]
*  But here's the difference. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  You have a budget, Congress doesn't. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=402.68s)]
*  And Congress just got caught trying to put $100 billion on our credit card. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  How long does $100 billion last? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=410.1s)]
*  Probably all year, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  No, two and a half months. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=414.5s)]
*  And then they do it all again. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=417.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=419.22s)]
*  Look how many pages this is. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=420.22s)]

*  They said, it's not directed to you, Mr. Speaker, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=791.6999999999999s)]
*  but we don't like the spending. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=793.74s)]
*  I said, guess what, fellas, I don't either. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=794.86s)]
*  We gotta get this done because here's the key. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=796.9s)]
*  By doing this, we are clearing the decks [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=799.3s)]
*  and we are setting up for Trump to come in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=801.74s)]
*  roaring back with the America First agenda. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=804.02s)]
*  Clearing the decks, what does that mean? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=806.62s)]
*  I don't know what clearing the decks means. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=808.42s)]
*  They keep saying this is gonna stop [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=810.62s)]
*  and every year they say, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=812.26s)]
*  this is the last time we're gonna do this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=813.0999999999999s)]
*  And then every year they do it again. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=815.0999999999999s)]
*  And now people aren't too happy with Mike. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=817.58s)]
*  You're already not planning to vote for him? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=820.46s)]

*  Have any other of your colleagues said [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=824.22s)]

*  I've talked to a few who don't seem like [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=829.7s)]
*  they're gonna vote for him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=833.46s)]
*  I'll vote for somebody else. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=834.5s)]
*  Does it have a strength to reform this institution, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=835.7800000000001s)]
*  this broken? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=838.5400000000001s)]

*  that he would do to change this institution. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  And this is not the way to govern. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=846.42s)]
*  That's not what American people elected us to do. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=847.8199999999999s)]
*  So what are we gonna do now? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=850.66s)]
*  We're gonna toss Johnson overboard [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=851.74s)]
*  like they did with McCarthy? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=853.02s)]
*  Then what? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=854.9s)]
*  Everyone they make speaker spends money. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=856.02s)]

*  without all the Democrat bells and whistles [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=867.4599999999999s)]
*  that will be so destructive to our country, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  all it will do after January 20th [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=872.02s)]
*  is bring the mess of the debt limit [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=874.0999999999999s)]
*  into the Trump administration [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=875.7399999999999s)]
*  rather than allowing it to take place [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=877.5s)]
*  in the Biden administration. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=879.18s)]

*  should and will be primaried. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=884.0999999999999s)]
*  Everything should be done and fully negotiated [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=885.8599999999999s)]
*  prior to my taking office on January 20th, 2025. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=888.78s)]
*  So guess what just happened? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=894.6999999999999s)]
*  Republicans just scrapped the spending bill [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=896.3399999999999s)]
*  and are gonna have to pull an all-nighter. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  They have until Friday at midnight to vote on a new bill [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=900.94s)]
*  or the government shuts down for Christmas. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=904.58s)]
*  Now what does it mean when the government shuts down? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=907.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=910.98s)]
*  Everybody goes nuts and then they rope off national parks [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=912.0200000000001s)]
*  so no one can hike. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=914.98s)]
*  Congress has had all year to get this done [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=916.86s)]
*  and they always wait until the last second [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=919.82s)]
*  and they try to pull a fast one, they get caught, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=921.9000000000001s)]
*  they whine about Christmas [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=923.74s)]
*  and promise they won't do it again [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=925.1800000000001s)]
*  and it's the same thing every time. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=926.82s)]
*  Trump won because Democrats caused inflation [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=929.62s)]
*  and now Republicans, with the help of Democrats, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=933.38s)]
*  are causing inflation before they go on vacation. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=936.58s)]
*  Biden's doing the same thing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=940.34s)]
*  Biden's spending $73 million to build solar panels [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=942.58s)]

*  to monitor methane emissions, to monitor cow flatulence. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=962.0600000000001s)]
*  How do you monitor that? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=967.14s)]
*  I don't wanna know, but it costs 160 million. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=969.0600000000001s)]
*  Even the Inspector General says this is fraud, waste, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=973.54s)]

*  Biden doesn't care. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=978.02s)]

*  They're negotiating golden parachutes into their contracts. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1014.9s)]
*  So if Trump comes in and says you're fired, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1017.98s)]
*  it's gonna cost 160 million bucks in severance packages. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1020.34s)]

*  This would fund the government through March, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1134.62s)]
*  but at what cost? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1136.6999999999998s)]
*  Raise the debt ceiling, at what cost? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1137.62s)]
*  Why should Donald Trump have to raise the debt ceiling [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1139.54s)]
*  when it's Joe Biden's problem? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1142.32s)]

*  another 10 billion in farm subsidies. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1158.7s)]

*  from the federal government to Washington, DC. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1181.5400000000002s)]

*  In other words, you paid for it, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1186.18s)]
*  a hugely valuable asset owned by the American taxpayers, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1187.94s)]

*  Explain that one. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1204.56s)]

*  is a pay increase for members of Congress. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1208.88s)]
*  That's right, I think they worked a whopping 138 days, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1212.52s)]
*  if my count is correct. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1216.06s)]
*  A pay increase that actually few deserve, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1218.38s)]

*  lawmakers have worked an average of about 140 days per year. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1221.7s)]
*  That's all they work, it's a part-time job. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1226.18s)]
*  And sadly, as a whole, their work has been unacceptable. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1228.7s)]
*  Our budget is out of control. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1232.78s)]
*  The bureaucratic state is a nightmare. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1234.64s)]

*  As I've been saying, it is time to get back [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1240.14s)]

*  Principles like limited government, greater freedom, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1247.86s)]

*  and say, why should we give them more money? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1295.6599999999999s)]
*  What about the media? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1297.1s)]

*  and applies the provision retroactively. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1353.3s)]
*  In other words, any investigation [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1356.54s)]
*  into witness tampering, Liz Cheney was just referred [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1358.66s)]

*  that supposedly funds the government? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1375.96s)]
*  Our friend Vivek Ramaswamy points out, quote, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1379.02s)]

*  There's no legitimate reason for them to be voted on [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1394.9s)]
*  as a package deal by a lame duck Congress. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1397.94s)]

*  That's a big provision. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1415.82s)]
*  17 different pieces of commerce legislation [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1417.26s)]
*  paving the way for a new football stadium [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awyE1kaEu98&t=1420.46s)]
