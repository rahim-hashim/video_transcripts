# Fox News Highlights - April 4, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y)
*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=5.72s)]
*  Thank you, as always, for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=7.54s)]
*  Now, if you have been checking your 401k, maybe obsessively, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=10.08s)]
*  over the last few days, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=14.82s)]
*  it's understandable that the steep decline has you worried. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=16.28s)]
*  The market slide is real, but it is also temporary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=20.64s)]
*  And the people I trust are right. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=24.96s)]
*  when they urge you to hang tight, do not panic sell. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=27.0s)]
*  But of course, the Democrats, who we know are incapable [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=31.0s)]
*  of raising the standard of living of middle-class Americans, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=35.0s)]
*  their only response is to fuel the panic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=38.0s)]
*  We've seen close to 8 or 9 percent of the stock market drop. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=41.0s)]
*  That means a lot of people's retirement plans are going out the window. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=46.0s)]
*  It's a bloodbath in the markets again today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=49.0s)]
*  For families, for small businesses, for small farmers in my state, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=54.0s)]
*  this is devastating. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=59.0s)]
*  And of course, they were quick to dismiss at the same time [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=61.0s)]
*  that gangbusters job number that came out today, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=65.0s)]
*  which beat expectations at 228,000 jobs created in March. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=68.0s)]
*  Remember, that's without the tax cut that's coming. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=74.0s)]
*  But I'm here tonight to tell you, when you hear the usual suspects [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=77.0s)]
*  predict the worst or claim that Trump's approach is ruinous, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=81.0s)]
*  well, remember this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=85.0s)]
*  These were many of the same people who told Americans to be patient [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=88.0s)]
*  when China began to devour our manufacturing sector. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=92.0s)]
*  So why would we ever take economic advice from them? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=96.0s)]
*  They told us that China would become more open, more free, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=100.0s)]
*  less of an adversary if we allowed them to join the World Trade Organization [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=104.0s)]
*  back in 2000. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=109.0s)]
*  And they certainly waved off concerns regarding American industries. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=111.0s)]
*  They weren't going to shrink. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=114.0s)]
*  Who cares, they said. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=116.0s)]
*  I mean, after all, it's only going to be what made in China [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=118.0s)]
*  Happy Meal toys and Nikes, maybe? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=121.0s)]
*  Well, you fast forward to today, and here's where things stand. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=124.0s)]
*  America has gone from being the dominant exporter of steel [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=128.0s)]
*  to number four in exporters behind China, Canada, and others. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=132.0s)]
*  And now, if we do nothing, China will dominate in everything from [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=138.0s)]
*  tools, computers, solar panels, shipbuilding, drones, satellites, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=144.0s)]
*  and yes, of course, pharmaceuticals. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=150.0s)]
*  Now, don't even get me started on what China is doing with artificial intelligence, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=153.0s)]
*  quantum computing, and biotech. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=158.0s)]
*  So Trump's economic reset, it comes after 30-plus years [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=161.0s)]
*  of disastrous economic policy that made a small subset of America [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=166.0s)]
*  very, very rich while the middle class fell further behind. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=171.0s)]
*  Nobody was crying these crocodile tears when they were closing the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=176.0s)]
*  Mount Road engine plant that Chrysler had in Macomb County [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=180.0s)]
*  or the Romeo engine plant in Romeo, Michigan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=184.0s)]
*  Now that we're trying to bring these products back, these components [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=189.0s)]
*  and these vehicles back to the United States, all of a sudden all the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=192.0s)]
*  so-called experts are saying it's going to plunge us into recession [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=196.0s)]
*  and be terrible for the economy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=199.0s)]
*  If they're crying, I think we're doing something right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=201.0s)]
*  As for the Republicans who are giving up on Trump's policies after two days, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=205.0s)]
*  be careful who your anti-tariff bedfellows are. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=211.0s)]
*  It's the first time we have seen some Republicans buck Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=215.0s)]
*  They've all too often gone along with him even when they know his policies [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=219.0s)]
*  are dead wrong. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=222.0s)]
*  So I welcome it and I hope it could pass. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=224.0s)]
*  It's a bipartisan bill and it shows you how bad these tariffs are when even [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=227.0s)]
*  Republicans who have been so afraid to break with Trump, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=231.0s)]
*  some of the leading Republicans are. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=234.0s)]
*  And anyway, that dinosaur, he gives us a really bad case of whiplash on the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=238.0s)]
*  tariffs issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=244.0s)]
*  My views on trade are probably closer to President Trump's than they were to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=246.0s)]
*  President Obama's or President Bush's. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=250.0s)]
*  I think our trade laws have hurt working people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=252.0s)]
*  The tariffs, if they wanted to do something about autos, should have been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=255.0s)]
*  much more pinpointed and isolated than this massive assault on American [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=258.0s)]
*  families, all to help the billionaires. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=266.0s)]
*  At one point today, it was so weird, he just started reading on live TV. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=268.0s)]
*  How worried are you that all of this could push the U.S. economy into a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=273.0s)]
*  recession? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=277.0s)]
*  I'm very worried about it, Dana. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=279.0s)]
*  This is one of the most disastrous and poorly thought out policies that the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=281.0s)]
*  Trump administration has done thus far. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=285.0s)]
*  What it does is it makes everybody just worry about spending money. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=288.0s)]
*  Businesses hold back on spending, on training, on hiring people, and it's so [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=292.0s)]
*  poorly done. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=297.0s)]
*  And you know, Dana, this policy taxes penguins but not Putin. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=298.0s)]
*  Penguins but not Putin? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=305.0s)]
*  I don't even know what that man's saying. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=307.0s)]
*  So look, I'm here tonight to tell you ignore the Dow doomsdayers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=309.0s)]
*  Remember, these are the people who get to trade in the market even though they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=313.0s)]
*  have a lot of effect on the market with their legislation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=317.0s)]
*  I'm not listening to any of these people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=320.0s)]
*  You have to think beyond the short run. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=322.0s)]
*  I think the CEO of United seems to get it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=325.0s)]
*  To me, what's happening there is there is a genuine desire from the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=329.0s)]
*  administration to actually create more careers like we create here at United [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=334.0s)]
*  Airlines for middle class Americans, to strengthen the middle class here in the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=338.0s)]
*  country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=342.0s)]
*  And I think that's a laudable goal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=343.0s)]
*  You may disagree fairly with the way we get there and the tactics to get there, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=345.0s)]
*  but the goal of creating great middle class careers I think is a laudable one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah, the United CEO is bullish on America. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=355.0s)]
*  Good stuff. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=358.0s)]
*  So when the dust settles, we are going to once again have a dynamic economy where [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=359.0s)]
*  companies and their workers who make things in America will have advantages. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=365.0s)]
*  It certainly will be more fair. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=371.0s)]
*  So people who build cars, people who forge steel will get paid more. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=373.0s)]
*  And hedge fund managers, they're going to do just fine as well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=379.0s)]
*  A friend today put it this way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=383.0s)]
*  Would Joe Sixpack rather have $62 oil or a temporary stock market loss? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=385.0s)]
*  Because the drop in oil prices and the 10-year treasury, that ends up immediate as a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=394.0s)]
*  tax cut for Main Street. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=401.0s)]
*  So at the end of this, we're going to have a stronger and a sounder economy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=403.0s)]
*  We won't be barely keeping ourselves afloat as we have been for years borrowing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=408.0s)]
*  trillions at a time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=413.0s)]
*  Right now the media is covering this because it's easier like a tariff story, but [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=415.0s)]
*  it's not. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=419.0s)]
*  It is much bigger than that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=420.0s)]
*  Soon there will be new tax policies, new regulatory policies, and then better [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=422.0s)]
*  schools, less crime, and fewer foreign workers to lower American wages. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=428.0s)]
*  Now that may upset the globalists who love keeping wages low and love outsourcing jobs [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=434.0s)]
*  to Vietnam and elsewhere, but it is music to the ears of all those Americans who saw [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=440.0s)]
*  their factories close and their families ripped apart in economic despair. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=446.0s)]
*  The working class vote I think is going to determine the 2028 election. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=450.0s)]
*  In the future, I think it belongs to the working people who swung the last election. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=455.0s)]
*  The Dow is going to come back, the Nasdaq too. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=460.0s)]
*  But if we kept going the way we were going, America as an independent, sovereign country [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=463.0s)]
*  would be finished. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=470.0s)]
*  Trump's moves are bold, yeah, but they're not calamitous. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=471.0s)]

*  You see this woman right here? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=919.0s)]
*  Take a look at her. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=920.0s)]
*  She's voicing her support for illegal immigration. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=921.0s)]

*  I was on it yesterday. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=940.0s)]
*  Anyway, last but certainly not least, the great Jimmy Faller will join us [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=941.0s)]
*  to wrap up this week's other news, including a fresh word salad from Kamala Harris, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=944.0s)]
*  who has reemerged to root against Donald Trump and cheer for economic suffering [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=950.0s)]
*  for hardworking men and women. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=955.0s)]
*  What a shock. Take a look. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=957.0s)]
*  We are seeing organizations stay quiet. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=959.0s)]
*  We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=962.0s)]
*  And these are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=977.0s)]
*  in our country. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=983.0s)]
*  And it understandably creates a great sense of fear. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=985.0s)]
*  Because, you know, there were many things that we knew would happen. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=991.0s)]
*  Many things. I'm not here, so I told you so. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=997.0s)]
*  Wow. Could you imagine four years of that? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1002.0s)]
*  I want to take a moment and thank every American that voted for Donald Trump [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1006.0s)]
*  because you prevented this country from having four years of that. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1010.0s)]
*  Now, let's be very clear. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1014.0s)]
*  After a really humiliating loss for her, Kamala Harris is not going to be able [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1016.0s)]
*  to get back to her. Kamala Harris is actively rooting, what, for American suffering? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1020.0s)]
*  She doesn't want Donald Trump to succeed. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1024.0s)]
*  She doesn't want Americans to have a better life. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1026.0s)]
*  I thought Democrats cared about working men and women. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1028.0s)]
*  Just talk. You know, she just wants to feel better about herself. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1030.0s)]
*  And she's not the only one. Barack Hussein Obama, back of the news, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1034.0s)]
*  chiming in and calling for collective sacrifice. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1038.0s)]
*  Sounds like Jimmy Carter. Take a look. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1042.0s)]
*  It has been easy during most of our lifetimes [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1044.0s)]
*  to say you are a progressive or say you are for social justice [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1049.0s)]
*  or say you're for free speech and not have to pay a price for it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1056.0s)]
*  And now we're at one of those moments where, you know what, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1064.0s)]
*  it's not enough just to say you're for something. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1068.0s)]
*  You may actually have to do something and possibly sacrifice a little bit. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1073.0s)]
*  Excuse me, the people that want to silence and the people that want to cancel [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1079.0s)]
*  and the people that boycott and the people that are woke and the word police, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1083.0s)]
*  that would be his party. In other words, but if you listen to Obama, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1087.0s)]
*  he too is rooting for Americans to suffer so that he can finally get Trump once and for all. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1090.0s)]
*  Of course, Obama won't experience any suffering himself. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1096.0s)]
*  He has his many multiple mansions all across the country in places like beautiful Matha's Vineyard. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1099.0s)]
*  He gets to hobnob with other with arrogant, rich and famous jackasses like his buddy and loser, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1105.0s)]
*  Jackass George Clooney. And we have a message for him later in the show. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1112.0s)]
*  Now for Obama, one big political game doesn't really care about the quality of your life, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1116.0s)]
*  the suffering you had the last four years. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1122.0s)]
*  He remains silent about the lies on immigration, the biggest national security threat in our lifetime. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1125.0s)]
*  And you know he just wants to say anything to trash Donald Trump because not only did Kamala lose, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1131.0s)]
*  he stood up for Kamala and Kamala lost. For example, here's what he said about Trump's reciprocal tariffs. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1137.0s)]
*  Take a look. I don't think what we just witnessed in terms of economic policy and tariffs is going to be good for America. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1143.0s)]
*  But let's go back a few years ago. He said the complete opposite. And we've got the tape. Take a look. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1151.0s)]
*  We can't keep passing unfair trade deals like NAFTA that put special interests over workers interests. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1157.0s)]
*  Well, I want to be very clear. I don't think NAFTA has been good for America and I never have. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1164.0s)]
*  I didn't just start criticizing unfair trade deals like NAFTA because I started running for office. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1171.0s)]
*  I'm doing it because I've seen what happens to a community when the factory closes down and jobs move overseas. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1176.0s)]
*  It's also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1183.0s)]
*  to make sure that they're providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1193.0s)]
*  Oh, top Democrats have always been championing reciprocal tariffs. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1204.0s)]
*  Oh, that is until this Tuesday, Liberation Day, when Donald Trump announced his plan to actually put it into action. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1209.0s)]
*  The exact same tariffs that they are on record supporting. Take a look. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1217.0s)]
*  That the average US MFM tariff on Chinese goods coming into the United States is 2 percent, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1224.0s)]
*  whereas the average Chinese MFM tariff on US goods going into China is 35 percent. Is that reciprocal? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1230.0s)]
*  What they have said is that we need to not worry about manufacturing in America [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1239.0s)]
*  because what we should establish is a policy of unfettered free trade. We don't need tariffs. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1249.0s)]
*  What we need is to allow corporate America the freedom, the freedom to throw American workers out on the street. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1256.0s)]
*  So I have been one of the chief critics of status quo on trade. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1264.0s)]
*  Americans, and I share this, resent all those academics who anytime you try to do anything with China, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1269.0s)]
*  they say protectionist, trade war. The bottom line is simple. China is eating our lunch. China is rapacious. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's amazing. You know what tape can do. It just reminds you what hypocrites, what liars they are. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1286.0s)]
*  Now, instead of working together with President Trump on a policy they've openly advocated for [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1292.0s)]
*  and enacting a trade policy they've always supported, Democrats, they are fomenting panic and hysteria as per usual. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1297.0s)]
*  Well, this hand wringing, it will be short lived. According to the White House, Vietnam, they're already begging, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1306.0s)]
*  they're offering to eliminate tariffs on the US. Cambodia, also desperate for a deal with Donald Trump [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1312.0s)]
*  with reports that the country is willing to slash their tariffs from 35 percent to 5 percent. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1318.0s)]
*  Reciprocal. They'll benefit, we'll benefit. That's the beauty of it. They have the choice, free and fair trade or reciprocal tariffs. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1324.0s)]
*  Up to them. Here at home, both General Motors, Nissan, they're working fast to expand their manufacturing plants. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1332.0s)]
*  Right here in the USA, high paying career jobs, there are dozens of other countries now working behind the scenes [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1338.0s)]
*  to lower their own tariffs and finally create a level playing field with the United States that they have been abusing [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1345.0s)]
*  and taking advantage of because we've had politicians that let them do it. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1352.0s)]
*  Most importantly, as FoxNews.com, an opinion piece points out, quote, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1357.0s)]
*  Liberation Day is about investment, not in financial derivatives or foreign product change, but in our own people to create jobs for them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1362.0s)]
*  Now, this is about putting America and American jobs first. That has been Donald Trump's sole mission from day one. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1372.0s)]
*  It was very clear during the campaign. And by the way, we are seeing massive results. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1379.0s)]
*  In March, the jobs report blew past every forecast, a whopping impressive 228,000 new jobs. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1384.0s)]
*  We'll call that the Trump effect. In contrast, Canada, they lost 33,000 jobs. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1392.0s)]
*  So let's be clear. Our country, we are not a charity for the rest of the world. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1397.0s)]
*  We compete with the rest of the world. They've been taking advantage of us. They've been abusing us. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1402.0s)]
*  Frankly, we've let them do it. And now we're finally playing to win. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1408.0s)]
*  So much clapping. It's like we're in my bedroom. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1414.0s)]
*  It's Friday. So you know what that means. Let's welcome tonight's guests. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1419.0s)]
*  He's got a VIP booth at the Cracker Barrel. Fox News contributor Tom Shalhoum. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1422.0s)]

*  They put him on Fox News every morning. So that way your day can only get better. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1439.0s)]

*  It's leftovers where I read the jokes we didn't use this week. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1462.0s)]
*  And as always, it's my first time reading them. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1467.0s)]
*  So if they suck, we'll force Joe Mackey to give Rosie O'Donnell a bikini wax. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1470.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. A 97 year old endangered tortoise has become the oldest first time mom of her species. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1474.0s)]

*  An old clip surfaced of Jasmine Crockett disparaging Byron Donalds for marrying a white woman. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1663.0s)]
*  But she did give props to Ilhan Omar for marrying a brother. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1670.0s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha! [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1677.0s)]
*  Cory Booker spoke for 25 hours on the Senate floor, pausing briefly for the cleaning crew to polish his head. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1679.0s)]

*  Let's do a monologue. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1771.0s)]
*  On Thursday, Trump unveiled his $5 million gold card, and he put his signature touch on it. His face. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1772.0s)]
*  You ready for some questions? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1802.0s)]
*  Anybody want to buy one? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1806.0s)]
*  Sign me up! [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1808.0s)]
*  But it's amazing, he's literally selling something for five million bucks that didn't exist before. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1810.0s)]
*  And yet he's already made billions off it. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1816.0s)]
*  Hey Commerce Secretary, how many digits sell yesterday? A thousand? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yesterday I sold a thousand. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1823.0s)]
*  Oh you did? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1826.0s)]
*  You have a green card, which used to be a green card. Now a gold card. You're a permanent resident of America. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1827.0s)]
*  They're going to have the right to be in America. It'd be five million dollars. And they have the right to be in America. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1833.0s)]
*  As long as they're good people. And they're vetted. And they're vetted. And they can't break the law. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1839.0s)]
*  We can always take it away if they're like evil or mean or bad or something. Not mean, but you know, if they do something horrible, you can take it away. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1843.0s)]
*  Amazing. Trump created something that cost nothing. That didn't exist before. That can then be sold, but also taken away. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1851.0s)]
*  It's a win-win. Like when my racehorse wins and then I eat it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1859.0s)]
*  But this is like a lot of Trump policies. It starts with a big idea that creates an asset out of thin air. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1868.0s)]
*  Like acquiring Greenland or Canada becoming the 51st state. Now the tariffs. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1876.0s)]
*  It's the first volley in a negotiation that brings attention to our concerns. And people way smarter than me. There's almost four of them. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1881.0s)]
*  They get it. Listen to this prediction on tariffs from former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1889.0s)]
*  I would assume that this will not be in place in a month, two months. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1895.0s)]
*  Definitely not in the back half of the year. So I'm in the camp that this is a beginning of a big negotiation. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1899.0s)]
*  It's not only about bringing production back, but it's also about market access. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1906.0s)]
*  See, Carlos is predicting that countries will rush to be part of this, just like the cast of The View when they hear that sound of an ice cream truck. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1911.0s)]
*  Already Israel and Vietnam are canceling or reducing tariffs on U.S. products. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1919.0s)]
*  Switzerland has eliminated industrial tariffs. And it's not just countries either. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1924.0s)]
*  Car companies are racing to reshore production. GM's expanding its Indiana plant. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1928.0s)]
*  Trump is making American car companies American again. And he hasn't spent a dime in subsidies to do it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1933.0s)]
*  He's negotiating using an asset that wasn't there before. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1939.0s)]
*  He'll threaten a move like making Canada a state pretending it's serious. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1944.0s)]
*  You know, single men do this all the time when they talk about marriage with their longtime girlfriends. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1949.0s)]
*  So does he really want Canada as a 51st state? Who knows? That's the point. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1955.0s)]
*  But what we do know, Canada is suddenly cracking down on fentanyl smuggling, and they're willing to take back Seth Rogen. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1961.0s)]
*  So you keep them off balance so you can make the deals on your terms. Makes me wonder, will the markets boom? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1970.0s)]
*  The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1978.0s)]
*  And the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal. I think it's going to be unbelievable. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1982.0s)]
*  So you see what Trump's doing. Create the big idea. Watch what happens. Read the rewards. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1988.0s)]
*  Trump eyes Greenland. Suddenly Denmark takes defense seriously. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1993.0s)]
*  Trump suggests leaving NATO. They start taking their own defense seriously. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=1997.0s)]
*  Trump threatens to retake the Panama Canal. Suddenly they're looking to sell operations to an American company. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2001.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Panama Cano. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2007.0s)]
*  But you see, actions get reactions. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2013.0s)]
*  Compare that to Cory Booker's 25 hour freak out on the Senate floor, flailing his arms like a car dealership tube man with an air leak. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2016.0s)]
*  It's the difference between action and acting. When you take action like tariffs, people take you seriously. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2026.0s)]
*  They begin negotiating amongst themselves before they even negotiate with you. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2032.0s)]
*  You create an asset that they have to come to terms with based on a concern that you have. That's action. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2037.0s)]
*  Booker is the opposite. Instead of drawing attention to a concern, it's about him. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2042.0s)]
*  And anytime you place emphasis on the self, you're less likely to act at all. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2048.0s)]
*  Worse, you drive yourself crazy. Research shows the more you self-obsess, the more you suffer from mental illness. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2052.0s)]
*  Maybe that's why their party is a crap show and why all the Dems seem to have crazy eyes. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2059.0s)]
*  Identity politics and elevation of the self to a point that it imposes demands on strangers has created a mob of really messed up people. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2065.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump creates uncertainty through action that has allies and enemies both moving in America's direction, even before the sit downs begin. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2074.0s)]
*  Uncertainty is a negotiation tool even before the negotiation starts. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2084.0s)]
*  Of course, that uncertainty now is the story for the media as they feign panic and outraged. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2089.0s)]
*  But don't listen to them. Hell, they never listen to us. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5m2z8aDA8Y&t=2095.0s)]
