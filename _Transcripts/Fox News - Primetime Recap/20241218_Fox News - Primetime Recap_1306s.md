# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 17, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k)
*  I remember Michelle Obama saying if Trump won, women would suffer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=0.0s)]
*  If we don't get this election right, your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  will become collateral damage to your rage. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Trump's pretty much already president, so let's check in on Michelle. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=16.68s)]
*  Tension everybody, we are full of good in you today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=21.68s)]
*  Do do do do, do do do do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=26.6s)]
*  So honored to have you, Michelle Obama has a happy place. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=30.6s)]
*  Do do do do, do do do do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=35.44s)]
*  Michelle Obama's walking, we can't let her go. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=39.44s)]
*  She's a classy lady, we just love her so. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=43.92s)]
*  We got Michelle Obama. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=47.68s)]
*  Michelle Obama looks proud of her country again, which is weird because Biden's about [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=51.68s)]
*  to turn the White House over to Hitler. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Everybody should be scared, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=59.6s)]

*  The only thing keeping Michelle up at night is what the stuff in Barack's stocking. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=65.02s)]
*  Who's the hardest to shop for? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=68.84s)]
*  He is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=71.68s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=72.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's just a boy, you know? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=73.68s)]
*  I mean he just doesn't do much. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=77.36s)]
*  He's golfs and there's only so many golf balls you can get a dude. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=79.68s)]
*  I'm trying to like get him clothes that he wouldn't buy, you know? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=83.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Because he's also cheap. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, who is the best gift giver out of you guys? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Probably me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I am because I'm actually paying attention to everyone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Ah, that is the trick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm like listening. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Michelle just said her husband's cheap, doesn't listen and chases balls all day like a little [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=104.48s)]
*  boy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  We'd show you the part where Jennifer Hudson asked Michelle about what it's going to be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  like living under a dictator and how women will survive the next four years, but she [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=112.56s)]
*  never asked. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=117.32s)]
*  Michelle put down some ground rules for the interview. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  After the biggest election in the history of the country, her words, not mine, Michelle [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=122.16s)]
*  said, don't ask me about politics. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=125.84s)]
*  Michelle's only allowed to be asked about her new book, her new Netflix show and her [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=128.64s)]
*  new fruit juice brand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=132.92s)]
*  Not very maja. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=135.2s)]
*  Michelle's got a push product. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=136.92s)]
*  It's the new golden age, remember? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=138.64s)]
*  It's almost like she's saying life goes on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=141.0s)]
*  The whole democracy is on the line was just a line. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=143.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris, same thing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=148.04s)]
*  She lost to a tyrant and she's still laughing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=149.6s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=152.72s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=155.72s)]
*  Remember the context in which you exist. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=158.72s)]
*  Yeah, I did that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=164.72s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=167.84s)]
*  In the face of an obstacle, do we throw up our hands or do we roll up our sleeves? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=173.84s)]
*  And as we approach. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=186.84s)]
*  She doesn't seem very worried that Trump's not in prison and he's about to take over [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=191.84s)]
*  the military. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=195.96s)]
*  Kamala just robbed owners to pay Oprah and Sharpton, then flew to Hawaii for a week with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=197.96s)]
*  Doug. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=202.96s)]
*  I guess that's normal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=203.96s)]
*  Bill Maher is also not losing any sleep over Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=206.16s)]
*  Of course, the worst things could happen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=209.16s)]
*  Trump could get into office and blow up the world on day one. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=214.16s)]
*  But, you know, I'm not going through the same spook as I did last time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=217.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=221.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=222.16s)]
*  When it happens, wake me. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=223.48s)]
*  But I'm not giving my mind over to it again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=225.2s)]
*  And I'll see what happens. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=228.56s)]
*  And one thing I've learned about the future is that we're very bad about predicting it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=230.16s)]
*  And whatever you think is probably likely to happen, probably isn't going to happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=235.66s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=240.66s)]
*  The media said Trump was going to order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate journalists. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=242.4s)]
*  And now the media is like, I'm going to sleep. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=246.8s)]
*  Wake me up when they're outside the door. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=248.76s)]
*  The journalists who thought they'd be dead in January were calling Trump for an interview. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=251.04s)]
*  The day after, the day after, Donald Trump had that crazy rally at Madison Square Garden. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=257.56s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=264.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=265.8s)]
*  Garbage. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=266.8s)]
*  I rolled the dice and I called him on the phone. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=267.8s)]
*  And he answered. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=270.8s)]
*  I called him and said, I want an interview with you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  Obviously he said no. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  But my point is, I was able to get to him by dialing his phone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=278.32s)]
*  Now that might be completely a b****. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=283.36s)]
*  And you're like, I can't believe people know this guy's phone number. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=285.36s)]
*  And remember when all these economists said Trump was going to light up inflation and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  send us into a recession? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=292.2s)]
*  Well this just in from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=294.36s)]
*  CEOs on Wall Street say they're more optimistic than they've been in years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=297.12s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=302.36s)]
*  Well, the media keeps writing these stories about the resistance. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=303.36s)]
*  What resistance? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=306.52s)]
*  We haven't seen it where? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrat donors are dining at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  Fetterman's meeting with Hegseth. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  We haven't seen a single protest anywhere. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=313.76s)]
*  The only thing they're resisting is Doge because they want to keep working from home. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=317.68s)]
*  The legacy media's audience is disappearing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=321.88s)]
*  MSNBC and CNN are getting spun off like dead weight by their parent companies. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=324.84s)]
*  So these hosts are starting to tell the truth because lying just got bad for business. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=329.88s)]
*  George Stephanopoulos just cost ABC $15 million because he defamed Trump. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=334.88s)]
*  And the Post reports he's humiliated. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=340.16s)]
*  First Disney lost to DeSantis and now they're funding Trump's presidential library. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=343.6s)]
*  And Stephanopoulos is apoplectic. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=348.36s)]
*  Chuck Todd's having nightmares about it and he doesn't even work in the media anymore, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=351.52s)]
*  I think. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=355.76s)]
*  This was stunning to me and absolutely a gut punch to anybody that works at a major media [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=357.88s)]
*  company because I think it does set a precedent that is going to be very difficult. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=364.34s)]
*  It's going to be very difficult to get out from under potentially. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=374.34s)]
*  I just, you know, I think the risk of losing this suit was 5%. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=386.78s)]
*  For ABC. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=387.78s)]
*  ABC. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=388.78s)]
*  So, you know, this was a decision to buy off a bad PR. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=390.61999999999995s)]
*  Well, today Trump sued that Iowa pollster Selzer, who accused of brazen election interference [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=398.26s)]
*  and consumer fraud for releasing a suppression poll on the eve of the election that added [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=405.34s)]
*  him down three to Kamala when he won by 13. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  Everybody in the discredited press is now trying to save their careers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=412.9s)]
*  Carol running the podcast saying, I knew we were going to lose. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=417.14s)]
*  If Democrats of the party about like caring more and doing more and caring about everybody, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=422.18s)]
*  they also need to have some hard conversations that when you care more and you treat people [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=427.14s)]
*  better, it might make the world cost more. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=432.42s)]
*  And they're afraid to say that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  And you have to just start saying those, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  Like the world's going to cost more. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=440.22s)]

*  When you guys leave here and you go to a bar, you're going to spend at least 10 minutes [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=443.3s)]
*  at that bar bitching to one another about how much the drinks cost. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=446.9s)]
*  And so when we wonder, and I'm not saying you shouldn't bitch about it, but we should [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=451.41999999999996s)]

*  We just watched Stephanie's interview with Kamala right before the election. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=458.97999999999996s)]
*  She folded. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=462.91999999999996s)]

*  And that it wasn't just some sort of automatic things. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=563.46s)]

*  overtime to sabotage the incoming Trump White House. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=695.18s)]

*  It is pretty clear to pretty much everyone now that the adults were not in charge over [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=762.1s)]

*  They're accused of invading a local apartment complex where they kidnapped, brutally tortured [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=788.64s)]

*  Americans are so fed up with what's going on and they have every right to be. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=871.0s)]
*  Just a mere handful. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=875.24s)]
*  I mean, what's a handful of apartment complexes on top of the known terrorists that they've [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=877.52s)]
*  allowed into the country, the murderers, the rapists, the cartel members, the gang members, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=882.0s)]
*  people murdering, raping American citizens, people guilty of other violent crimes against [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=887.96s)]
*  members of our country. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=894.32s)]
*  You know, ultimately this is why so many Americans turned against the Democratic Party. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  They created this crisis, then told you that their suffering wasn't real or significant, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=902.4s)]
*  and then lied and said the border was secure and the border was closed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=908.3399999999999s)]
*  And now for one last twist of the knife, the Biden administration is practically giving [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  away the border wall materials, pennies on the dollar, only out of spite to slow Donald [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  Trump's ability to keep his promise to secure the border. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=924.48s)]
*  That means you will pay for more border wall materials and you'll pay a lot more. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=927.48s)]
*  So really they're hurting us. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=932.8s)]
*  These Democrats breathlessly smearing Donald Trump for years, all while claiming to be [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=934.92s)]
*  so virtuous protectors of democracy and the rule of law. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=939.6s)]
*  They embarked on one witch hunt after another. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=943.86s)]
*  It's been nine long years. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=947.0s)]
*  Get Trump, get Trump, get Trump. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=949.24s)]
*  And exclaimed that no one's above the law. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=951.72s)]
*  And then Biden pardoned his own son Hunter, and more to come, by the way, for an 11 year [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=954.64s)]
*  crime spree, letting him off the hook for gun charges, tax charges, and so much more. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=958.96s)]
*  And Joe is only getting started. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=965.1s)]
*  How many other Bidens will be pardoned by the time this is all said and done? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  Will Joe pardon himself? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=970.36s)]
*  These preemptive pardons. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=972.14s)]
*  Remember, he granted clemency to a doctor who diluted chemotherapy drugs, along with [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=973.64s)]
*  a woman who stole $4 million from the USDA program to feed poor children and a government [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=979.76s)]
*  official who stole $53 million in tax revenue in a small Illinois town of what, 15,000. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=986.0s)]
*  And perhaps worst of all, you know, Biden also commuted the sentence of the notorious [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=994.34s)]
*  kids for cash judge. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1000.0600000000001s)]
*  That's a guy that was taking kickbacks. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1002.4s)]
*  How nice of him. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1004.12s)]
*  From a private for-profit detention center in exchange for locking up kids at their [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1005.36s)]
*  facility. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1010.2s)]
*  All told, 4,000 juvenile convictions were thrown out. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1011.32s)]
*  But that's not all. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1015.42s)]
*  Last month, Biden commuted the sentences of two Chinese spies and a relative of a high [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1016.84s)]
*  ranking official from China's Communist Party convicted of child pornography charges. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1022.1s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1028.44s)]
*  I wonder if this has to do with the WhatsApp message to the head of the energy conglomerate [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1029.44s)]
*  in China, CEFC. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1034.72s)]
*  I'm sitting here with my father and between everyone he knows and my ability to hold the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1036.52s)]
*  grudge you're going to regret not giving us the money. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  And voila, days later, millions of dollars went into one of those James Comer described [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1044.44s)]
*  bank accounts of Hunter Biden. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1051.36s)]
*  And in yet another nod to China, Biden signed a five-year science pact with the Communist [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1055.06s)]
*  Chinese despite the COVID disaster and near constant intellectual property theft, unfair [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1061.16s)]
*  trade practices. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1067.88s)]
*  I'm pretty certain Trump will deal with all of this in short order. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1069.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is not going to abide by what Joe Biden just signed. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1073.52s)]
*  And maybe, just maybe, Joe Biden is not the good, honest, decent statesman that he's been [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1077.92s)]
*  claiming to be because it appears to be that way, you know, with Biden on his way out. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  The international community, they frankly are breathing a sigh of relief. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1090.46s)]
*  World leaders lighting up to meet with Donald Trump. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1094.3400000000001s)]
*  He has already spent time with several presidents, prime ministers from Europe. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1097.1000000000001s)]
*  Argentina's president flew to Florida to meet with Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1101.18s)]
*  So did the wife of the late Japanese prime minister. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1105.26s)]
*  He was assassinated, you may recall, back in 2022. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1108.14s)]
*  And Canada's prime minister, Little Justin, he also paid Trump a visit at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1112.22s)]
*  But Little Justin, well, he may not be in leadership for much longer. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1118.26s)]
*  Yeah, the far left prime minister is fighting off votes of no confidence as we speak after [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1122.54s)]
*  facing his own economic and immigration crisis. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1127.82s)]
*  Now, as per usual, Trump is ready, willing to meet and talk to anybody. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1130.82s)]
*  You know, we can barely get Joe to speak. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1136.34s)]
*  And when he did, it was a disaster and an embarrassment. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1138.3s)]
*  Unlike Biden and Harris, Donald Trump is well versed. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1141.42s)]
*  He's capable. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1144.14s)]
*  He did an impromptu, nearly hour and a half presser yesterday. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1145.22s)]
*  And as one MSDNC host pointed out, he is accessible. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1148.7s)]
*  Just ask Joe Amica also. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1153.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1155.18s)]
*  I called him and said, I want an interview with you. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1156.18s)]
*  Obviously, he said no. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1158.38s)]
*  But my point is, I was able to get to him by dialing his phone. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1159.74s)]
*  Now that might be completely a***** and you're like, I can't believe people know this guy's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1164.8200000000002s)]
*  phone number. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1168.38s)]
*  But the reverse of that, if I were to want to connect with VP Harris or President Biden, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1169.38s)]
*  there's 50 people between me and that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1176.22s)]
*  I could write a note that maybe could get to somebody to get somebody then through Pony [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1179.5800000000002s)]
*  Express and a pigeon, something might end up in a mailbox near them. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1182.98s)]
*  And I called DJ T to say, yo, can I have an interview with you? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1187.3000000000002s)]
*  And he answered. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1189.74s)]
*  But I still was able to connect with him. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1190.74s)]
*  By the way, very nice of Donald Trump. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1193.18s)]
*  Very nice to take her call. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1196.38s)]
*  Very nice to meet with Joe Amica. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1197.78s)]
*  However, I would gently remind the president, not that he's going to listen to me, that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1199.46s)]
*  they hate him. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1203.9s)]
*  They're the ones that spread and peddled the lies and conspiracy theories about him. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1205.18s)]
*  They're the ones that wanted him in jail. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1209.8s)]
*  They're the ones that called him a fascist and racist and every other name in the book. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1211.78s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1216.34s)]
*  Maybe they're not your friends and you just have to, you know, come to a reckoning to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1217.74s)]
*  that truth. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1221.18s)]
*  With the days of secrecy, dishonesty, lack of availability and lack of transparency, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1222.34s)]
*  they are over from the border to crime, to the economy, to spy balloons and little drones [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1228.76s)]
*  flying over our head. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1234.6s)]
*  Trump is upfront about his plans, about his agenda. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1236.26s)]
*  And as for that current drone scandal now brewing nationwide on January 20th, 2025, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1239.3799999999999s)]
*  the gaslighting in this country will come to an end. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1245.6599999999999s)]
*  Our federal government is now abusing power like never before. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1248.94s)]
*  But in 34 short days, Donald Trump will bring about the return of a basic principle. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1253.78s)]
*  Our federal government cannot abuse power like this ever again. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1260.5800000000002s)]
*  In 24 days, Trump will bring about a return of a basic American principle. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1265.4s)]
*  Our government will once again be by the people, for the people, of the people, and the all-powerful [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1271.3600000000001s)]
*  bureaucratic state is facing a reckoning. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1277.6999999999998s)]
*  We will have a return to constitutional order. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1281.2199999999998s)]
*  What did our framers and our founders, what do they want more than anything? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1284.3s)]
*  They wanted something called limited government, greater freedom, and hopefully we can return [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1287.78s)]
*  to that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVnuA_DG9k&t=1293.1s)]
