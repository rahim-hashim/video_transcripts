# Fox News Highlights - April 23rd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE)
*  Democrats want to play a game of, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=0.0s)]
*  are you smarter than a Republican? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  Jasmine, not to be confused with Davy Crockett, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=3.88s)]
*  says she'll take on the best. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=6.18s)]
*  When you bring up the idiot known as Elon Musk, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=9.32s)]
*  he knows how to hire smart people, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=12.36s)]
*  but don't conflate that and believe that he is the genius, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=13.96s)]
*  because he ain't. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=17.16s)]
*  It says a lot when you literally are supposed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=17.92s)]
*  to be the leader of the free world, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=20.66s)]
*  and you're worried about a rising sophomore in the House. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=21.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=25.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=26.04s)]
*  Or you wish she was on your side. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=26.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=28.84s)]
*  He also called you low IQ. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=31.64s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware of that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=33.18s)]
*  Would you be willing to take an IQ test publicly, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=34.28s)]
*  head to head against the president of the United States? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=37.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=39.76s)]
*  Jazzy said she'd win a battle of wits with DJT, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=41.84s)]
*  and Musk ain't a genius. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=45.04s)]
*  Where'd she get her confidence? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=47.68s)]
*  I actually wanted to be an anesthesiologist. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=50.16s)]
*  So I've always been really good at math and science, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  but I didn't want to talk to people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  You wanted to put people to sleep, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=59.08s)]
*  and you kind of are doing the opposite thing now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=60.76s)]
*  Yes, I want them to be woke now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Democrats like Crockett keep telling us how smart they are, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=66.92s)]
*  but where's the proof? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=70.24s)]
*  What's one good idea Democrats have had in the last 20 years? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=71.84s)]
*  Name one. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=74.72s)]
*  They're great at telling other people what to do, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  but why does anyone listen? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=78.6s)]
*  The people telling you what to do have never done a thing, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=80.72s)]
*  and it's starting to sink in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=84.12s)]
*  Lowest net favorable rating since the 90s. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=86.96s)]
*  What do you think's driving that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=90.96s)]
*  Why are Democrats so relatively unpopular? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=92.36s)]
*  A sense that Democrats are culture elites, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  how they talk, the issues they cared about, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=99.55999999999999s)]
*  all the DEI programs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  And so essentially, I think a lot of people in America, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=104.6s)]
*  in the middle of the country, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=108.44s)]
*  thought Democrats were looking down on them, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=109.52s)]
*  and they weren't competent to govern. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=111.8s)]
*  There's another word for that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=114.0s)]
*  Snobbs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=115.92s)]
*  We live in a representative republic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=117.24s)]
*  Politicians are at least supposed to pretend [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=118.92s)]
*  to represent the people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=121.0s)]
*  The country says, we don't want DEI. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=122.8s)]
*  Democrats say, yeah, you do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=125.12s)]
*  The country says, we don't want gay porn in kindergarten. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=127.8s)]
*  And the Democrats went to the Supreme Court [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=131.12s)]
*  and said, yeah, you do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=133.12s)]
*  Pride Puppy was the book that was used [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=135.88s)]
*  for the pre-kindergarten curriculum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=137.6s)]
*  That's no longer in the curriculum. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=139.28s)]
*  That's the one where they are supposed to look [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=140.36s)]
*  for the leather and things, and bondage, things like that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=142.12s)]
*  It's not bondage. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=145.52s)]
*  It's a woman in a leather. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=146.36s)]
*  Sex worker, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=148.56s)]
*  No? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=149.4s)]
*  That's not correct. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=150.22s)]
*  No. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=151.06s)]
*  Gosh, I read it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=151.9s)]
*  Drag queen and drag queen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Drag queen and drag queen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=154.84s)]
*  Hmm, drag queen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=156.56s)]
*  Imagine going all the way to the Supreme Court [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  to demand drag queens in kindergarten. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=160.08s)]
*  Catholic parents, Jews, Muslim parents, all said no. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats said, we're gonna teach your six-year-old [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  about gay sex, whether you like it or not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  The country, in a landslide election, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=170.88s)]
*  said, we don't want boys and girls locker rooms. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=172.76s)]
*  And Democrats said, you're all bigots [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=175.6s)]
*  and we'll see you in court. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=177.64s)]
*  I'd like to announce that I'm suing the president [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=179.84s)]
*  of the United States, Donald Trump, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=182.4s)]
*  and Attorney General, Pam Bondi, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=184.54s)]
*  and the United States Department of Justice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=186.88s)]
*  Here is the opening line of our lawsuit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=191.32s)]
*  Minnesota brings this lawsuit to stop President Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  and his administration from bullying vulnerable children [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=198.68s)]
*  in this state. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=202.28s)]
*  We will not participate in this shameful bullying. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=203.38s)]
*  Tampons AG is taking Trump to court, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=207.24s)]
*  so high school girls have to shower with boys. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=209.66s)]
*  This is the party who said, believe all women. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=212.52s)]
*  And all women said, get these guys out of the showers, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=215.44s)]
*  they're creeping us out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the party that said, college boys, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=219.82s)]
*  before they kiss their girlfriends, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=222.0s)]
*  have to ask for consent. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=224.16s)]
*  And now they're saying, boys can just waltz [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=226.88s)]
*  into the girls' locker rooms, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=228.64s)]
*  and they can strip down and no doesn't mean no. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=229.76s)]
*  These snobs think they know better than the president [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=233.0s)]
*  and not just Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=235.56s)]
*  A new report in the New York Times says, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=237.48s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't want men playing in women's sports, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=239.32s)]
*  but Susan Rice told him, yeah, you do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=243.36s)]
*  Guess who won that debate? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=247.0s)]
*  Not Joe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=248.92s)]
*  Susan Rice overruled the president of the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=250.36s)]
*  These snobs told you, you were a gullible rude [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=254.84s)]
*  if you thought Joe Biden was lost in an Italian field. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=258.34s)]
*  Ah, he was just going to go shake some hands [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=262.26s)]
*  at the parachuters, you've probably never even been [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=264.06s)]
*  to Italy, you country bumpkin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=265.85999999999996s)]
*  You don't even know how it is there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=268.02s)]
*  Not an iota of shame has entered into their brain. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=270.46s)]
*  A CNN journalist asked a new media journalist [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=274.17999999999995s)]
*  who just got credentialed to the White House this, listen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=277.7s)]
*  You don't deserve to be here [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=280.9s)]
*  because you're not a real journalist. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  What's your response to them? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=284.94s)]
*  Well, I'm pretty sure the group of people in there [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=286.38s)]
*  just spent what was it, four years covering [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=289.18s)]
*  for someone who was essentially dead [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=291.02s)]
*  and that's being charitable in my description of him, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=293.18s)]
*  a president by the name of Joe Biden. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=295.42s)]
*  So to all those people who are apoplectic [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=297.3s)]
*  over having new media voices, you guys failed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  and that's why we're here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=301.78s)]
*  CNN journalists are so fixated on their title [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=303.21999999999997s)]

*  and gave the American people license to live their lives [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=584.06s)]
*  without being nagged, censured and disrespected. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=587.3s)]

*  90 million eligible voters did not vote. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=610.4200000000001s)]

*  And the reason I think you should [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=618.38s)]

*  They didn't know, they couldn't understand the why. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=625.86s)]

*  Clooney is basically saying Democrat politicians [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=657.62s)]
*  need to be more like him. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=659.74s)]

*  why doesn't he run? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=663.34s)]
*  Actors, singers, lawyers, CNN, Tampon, they all know better. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=665.38s)]

*  What many of these snobs don't get [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=682.9000000000001s)]
*  is that we're watching them take an IQ test every day. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=684.74s)]
*  And every day we see the score. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=689.9000000000001s)]
*  But we begin tonight with a question. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=692.58s)]
*  What have elected Democrats, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=695.3800000000001s)]
*  what have they done for you at all, if not lately? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  Anything? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=700.1800000000001s)]
*  Have they improved your schools? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=701.1s)]
*  Did they lower your taxes? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=702.6600000000001s)]
*  Did they bring down costs? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=704.22s)]
*  Did they secure your border? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=705.6600000000001s)]
*  Did they make your country more safe and more secure? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  Did they put your social security, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=710.3800000000001s)]
*  hard earned money in the lock box like they promised? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=712.0600000000001s)]
*  Or did they squander your hard earned tax dollars? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=714.82s)]
*  Are they robbing your children of their future [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=717.66s)]
*  with nearly $40 trillion in debt? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=720.3s)]
*  Oh, how's that Obamacare thing working out [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=722.5799999999999s)]
*  for you and your family? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=725.1s)]
*  Did they lift a finger to make any of your lives better? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=726.3399999999999s)]
*  We all know the answer, of course not. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=731.06s)]
*  But just look at the effort, the resources [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  they're putting into people that are not American citizens. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=735.74s)]
*  Just today, delegation, Democrats traveled to Louisiana. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=739.66s)]
*  In this case, they are begging and pleading [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=743.3399999999999s)]
*  for the release of two international students [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=746.06s)]
*  that are fighting deportation. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=748.78s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=750.42s)]
*  When those constitutional protections are eroded, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=751.74s)]
*  the protections of all of us are eroded. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=755.98s)]
*  There's no evidence of finding, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=759.46s)]
*  there's no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=761.02s)]
*  They've been convicted of no crime. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=762.86s)]
*  They were just living their lives [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=765.74s)]
*  and making positive contributions [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=767.66s)]
*  in society every single day. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  This is not about enforcing the law. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=772.26s)]
*  This is moving us toward an authoritarian state. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=776.58s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for suffering a miscarriage. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=780.22s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for reading a banned book. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=783.38s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for practicing diversity, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=787.5s)]
*  equity, and inclusion. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=789.78s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for exercising free speech. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=791.78s)]
*  Unless Congress and unless the American people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=796.14s)]
*  stand up and push back, they will succeed. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=798.9s)]
*  They will succeed in destroying our democracy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=801.78s)]
*  They will succeed in destroying what people [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=804.18s)]
*  all around the world admire [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=806.3s)]
*  about the United States of America. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=807.5799999999999s)]
*  I reject this draconian vision for this country [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=809.38s)]
*  that Donald Trump has. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=812.62s)]
*  He is a dictator. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=814.0999999999999s)]
*  And the only way to beat a dictator is with defiance. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=816.14s)]
*  All right, this is your modern, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=820.02s)]
*  radical, extreme Democratic party. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  They are literally fighting for the rights [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=823.54s)]
*  of people that are designated gang members. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=825.7399999999999s)]
*  They are, in this case, both international students [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=829.4599999999999s)]
*  and the people that ordered back to their home countries [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=832.5400000000001s)]
*  after the State Department accused them [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=834.5400000000001s)]
*  of fomenting anti-American and anti-Semitic rage. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  In particular, Mahmoud Khalil played a prominent role [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=839.74s)]
*  in the disruptive riots at Columbia University [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=844.1s)]
*  that began right after the October 7th attack. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=846.5400000000001s)]
*  Now Democrats, this is their next cause, Celeb. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=850.14s)]
*  They want him released back into our country [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=853.14s)]
*  to continue his activism. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=855.9000000000001s)]
*  One has to wonder if they even know [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=858.26s)]
*  that Hamas is a designated terrorist organization. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=860.66s)]
*  Their own charter calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=864.18s)]
*  Now these same Democrats have never traveled [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=867.78s)]
*  to the Middle East to demand the release [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=870.14s)]
*  of American citizens still being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=872.38s)]
*  And these pro-Hamas students, of course, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=876.66s)]
*  they are now the cause, Celeb. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=879.5799999999999s)]
*  We saw the same thing with the suspected gang member, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=881.18s)]
*  wife-beater, illegal immigrant, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=884.3s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, four other Democrats [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=888.46s)]
*  that are traveling all the way to El Salvador [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=890.7s)]
*  for this person. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=893.5400000000001s)]
*  This is what is at the top of their list. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=894.58s)]
*  But none of them, and we've looked deeply, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=897.4200000000001s)]
*  we cannot find one of them that bothered [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=899.82s)]
*  to pick up a phone and call the family of Maryland, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=901.86s)]
*  mother of five, Rachel Morin or Kayla Hamilton, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=905.02s)]
*  both Marylanders who were raped and murdered [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=908.7s)]
*  by illegal immigrants from El Salvador. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=911.7800000000001s)]
*  Now Van Hollen, after a lot of criticism about this, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=913.94s)]
*  was shamed into releasing a minor short statement [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=917.14s)]
*  about another Maryland mother who was murdered [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=920.42s)]
*  by an illegal immigrant, but then spent the rest [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=923.42s)]
*  of the day on X tweeting out about his new BFF, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=926.14s)]
*  the suspected gang member, human trafficker, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=930.74s)]
*  wife-beater, and illegal immigrant. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=933.58s)]
*  Apparently the American people just aren't a top priority [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=935.62s)]
*  for Democrats, and here's yet another example. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=939.22s)]
*  Democrats in California have granted early release [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=942.34s)]
*  to an illegal immigrant, a guy driving 100 miles an hour, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=945.14s)]
*  drunk, high, wasted, slammed into a car, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=949.0600000000001s)]
*  killed two 19-year-olds, burning them alive. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=952.9s)]
*  Now thankfully the Trump administration [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=956.74s)]
*  has just filed felony charges against this illegal immigrant [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=958.74s)]
*  to prevent his release back into the US. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=962.1800000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, in New Mexico, the state Supreme Court [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=964.82s)]
*  just barred a judge from the bench [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=967.46s)]
*  after an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=969.6600000000001s)]
*  was arrested at his home. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=972.0600000000001s)]
*  By the way, can you believe all this is happening [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=973.62s)]
*  in your country? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=975.54s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=976.5s)]
*  Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayor Orcas, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=977.82s)]
*  they all have blood on their hands. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=980.22s)]
*  They allowed this to happen and then lied to all of you [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=981.82s)]
*  for four years. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=984.74s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=985.58s)]
*  The judge was pictured with his arms around [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=986.94s)]
*  the suspected gang member who entered our country illegally [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=989.38s)]
*  under Biden and Harris in 2023, and then in New York City, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=993.42s)]
*  thanks to Biden's wide open borders. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=997.78s)]
*  Well, there are so many violent illegal immigrants [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=999.82s)]
*  inside our country that a rival gang to Tren de Aragua [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1002.66s)]
*  has already formed and is now committing a series [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1006.26s)]
*  of chilling crimes in that city. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1009.3s)]
*  So far 27 have been indicted on sex trafficking, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1011.9s)]
*  drug trafficking, and firearms charges, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  but they are not the only violent offenders [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1017.26s)]
*  who have been roaming the streets. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1019.3399999999999s)]
*  Now this has been going on for years, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1021.02s)]
*  and thanks to the Democrats' open borders policy [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1022.98s)]
*  or their silence and their outright lying [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1025.86s)]
*  about what's been going on the last four years. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1028.5s)]
*  Look at the headline, New York Post, quote, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1030.9s)]
*  Trump's mass deportation raids result in a 655% spike [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1033.14s)]
*  in arrests of terrorists roaming the US, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1039.5400000000002s)]
*  including one of India's most wanted. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1043.1000000000001s)]
*  Now if we can somehow avoid a large scale terror [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1046.5400000000002s)]
*  attack inside the United States in the next few years, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  it will be thanks to Donald Trump's tough action [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1052.5400000000002s)]
*  on immigration. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1054.94s)]
*  If it does happen, that's more blood on Kamala's hands, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1055.94s)]
*  Biden's hands, and Mayorkas's hands, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1059.46s)]
*  and frankly the Democrats that also lied to us. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1061.74s)]

*  And she said, yes, Joe Biden is running circles behind us [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1459.8999999999999s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1462.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1463.6599999999999s)]
*  Wow, is he beating you? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1464.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1465.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1466.1399999999999s)]
*  The Pritzker thing is kind of interesting. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1467.98s)]
*  So all of this is being, he is surfacing and getting [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1469.74s)]
*  media attention. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1473.54s)]
*  And it's like a trial balloon, right? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1474.3799999999999s)]
*  But with him, it's more like a lead balloon. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1476.26s)]
*  Definitely a balloon. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1478.78s)]
*  It's not going to work, right? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1479.74s)]
*  He's going to fall right over. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1481.02s)]
*  And then he says that he doesn't believe [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1482.26s)]
*  that transgender males would be able to beat women, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1484.7s)]
*  because he wouldn't either. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1489.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1491.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1494.3s)]
*  That is science. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1495.02s)]
*  That is just true. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1496.54s)]
*  He's a very, very liberal guy. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1498.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1501.5800000000002s)]
*  Get to know him. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1502.06s)]
*  His progressive policies make some peoples [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1503.06s)]
*  look downright centrist. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1505.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1506.98s)]
*  Now, there's something creepy about him. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1507.5s)]
*  And I'm not fat phobic. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1509.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm just afraid he might eat me. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1511.3s)]
*  Adam, that's not being fat phobic. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1513.46s)]
*  I just have a fear of being eaten. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1515.74s)]
*  I'm a very small person. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1517.3400000000001s)]
*  I get stuck in Tyrus's teeth. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1518.7s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1521.38s)]
*  He's quick, though. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1522.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1524.02s)]
*  Adam, what do you make of this, how the UK is coming [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1526.42s)]
*  to terms with reality, but America still [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1528.7s)]
*  has people like Pritzker? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1530.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, it's crazy. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1532.22s)]
*  It's only if the UK could come up with dentists. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1533.46s)]
*  But no, I mean, look, I think as far as trans athletes, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1538.98s)]
*  we should just go to the expert, like Caitlyn Jenner. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1542.3s)]
*  Because, you know, I mean, Caitlyn [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1545.46s)]
*  was the best male athlete. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1547.06s)]
*  And now she's saying that they have an advantage. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1548.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1550.94s)]
*  By the way, she's running for governor of California. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1551.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to vote, because finally someone with balls. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1554.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1556.1s)]
*  But. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1556.6s)]
*  That should be her slogan. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1560.5s)]
*  That should be her slogan. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1562.54s)]
*  But look, there are, and like Trump [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1563.86s)]
*  is banning trans people from the military. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1566.94s)]
*  So once again, we're losing our privates. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1569.1399999999999s)]
*  That's good. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1572.3s)]
*  Is it? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1576.86s)]
*  Is it good? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1577.86s)]
*  They're like, I can't tell if they're like fortune cookie [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1579.1s)]
*  riddles or what. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1581.82s)]
*  But I still like them. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1583.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm always hungry after I hear them. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1585.46s)]
*  So Julie, always a pleasure to see you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1587.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1589.98s)]
*  Son. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1590.94s)]
*  Don't believe a word he says. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1594.06s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1595.54s)]
*  You know, Biden could have taken a stance, and he didn't. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1596.34s)]
*  For women. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1601.26s)]
*  He hates women, doesn't he? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1602.74s)]
*  Well, he only likes Jill. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1604.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1605.46s)]
*  I don't even think Jill likes him. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1605.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1607.3799999999999s)]
*  She made him stay in the White House. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the only reason why he was there [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1609.26s)]
*  for the last two years. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1610.8799999999999s)]
*  He would have bailed out. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1612.3s)]
*  But Pritzker, I just got to go back [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1613.3799999999999s)]
*  to this whole trans situation. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1615.06s)]
*  Because the majority of the country [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1616.78s)]
*  definitely does believe that trans women should not [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1618.28s)]
*  be playing against biological women. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1621.02s)]
*  And Congresswoman Mary Miller is actually [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1623.94s)]
*  trying to introduce legislation where there would [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1626.3799999999999s)]
*  be a federal investigation as to whether or not [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1628.58s)]
*  trans women can play against biological women. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1630.82s)]
*  I think bottom line is this. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1635.4199999999998s)]
*  This country is sick and tired of this whole trans situation. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1637.34s)]
*  It's not about whether you're against trans. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1640.78s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1642.62s)]
*  It's about fairness. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1643.46s)]
*  Everybody agrees it's unfair for trans women [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1644.54s)]
*  to play against biological. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1646.6s)]
*  And the Democratic Party just needs [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1648.1799999999998s)]
*  to move on and realize that this is all [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1650.1799999999998s)]
*  about what you were born with. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1652.3799999999999s)]
*  The gender identity is about birth, not about choice. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1653.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1658.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1659.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you could conceivably identify as a woman. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1668.28s)]
*  I mean, if you wanted to, you could just enter a- [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1668.78s)]
*  Yeah, just take away my accountability and honor [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1672.0s)]
*  and truth telling facts. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1675.04s)]
*  Spend my whole life asking him if my ass is getting big. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I'm good. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1681.6s)]
*  No. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1682.44s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1684.94s)]
*  Hi, Pritzker. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1685.44s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1686.44s)]
*  Hi. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1687.44s)]
*  Are you sick of having to use the terms that they give us, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1687.94s)]
*  whether it's trans kids, transgender women, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1692.88s)]
*  it's men claiming they're women? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1695.64s)]
*  Just do that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1698.56s)]
*  It's bad acting young men who are confused and probably [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1699.24s)]
*  spent, well, we know they spent hours upon hours upon hours [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1703.6000000000001s)]
*  on the internet and probably looking at a lot of porn sites [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1708.56s)]
*  and just getting unrealistic. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1712.44s)]
*  And it's a real problem. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1714.04s)]
*  And then you have to keep asking yourself, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1715.88s)]
*  these are smart politicians. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1718.64s)]
*  They wouldn't, he's a billionaire. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1720.5600000000002s)]
*  He knows how to get things done. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1722.68s)]
*  He also knows how to find food. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1724.0s)]
*  So we know that he's able to, he's an intelligent man. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1725.4s)]
*  So you have to, I always say, how come for? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1730.4s)]
*  Why such plant in the flag on this thing? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1733.48s)]
*  Because this is what their core value is, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1737.88s)]
*  is the smoke screen problem. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  It used to be white men. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1745.44s)]
*  In the beginning part of the pandemic, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1746.92s)]
*  it was white men are all the problems for everything. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1748.48s)]
*  And I actually enjoyed that a little bit. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1750.52s)]
*  And then now it's another thing where they say these trans kids [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1753.8s)]
*  and they're, what do these poor trans kids [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1756.3200000000002s)]
*  have to deal with, the evil society? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1758.72s)]
*  Their suicide rate is high. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1762.28s)]
*  They can't do it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1763.52s)]
*  But we're not seeing any of this stuff. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1764.1200000000001s)]
*  So I always go back to the same thing. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1765.6000000000001s)]
*  And I feel like it's a broken record. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1767.16s)]
*  How much money are you making off this issue? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1768.92s)]
*  How much of our funding is going to this issue? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1771.8s)]
*  Because it makes zero sense for any person [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1774.64s)]
*  within, even to have this argument. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1777.6000000000001s)]
*  I could sit down and a matter of fact, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1780.0s)]
*  if I sat down two five year olds, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1781.64s)]
*  a five year old little boy and a five year old little girl, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1783.48s)]
*  and I was like, how many genders are? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1785.4s)]
*  And they'll be like, she's a girl, ill, and I'm a boy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1786.96s)]
*  And then the little girl would be like, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1792.4s)]
*  I'm a girl and boys drool. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1793.76s)]
*  They know, this isn't hard. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1795.72s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  why are these educated, financially successful [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1799.24s)]
*  people doing it? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1803.2s)]
*  Obviously there's a way for them to make some money. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1804.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you think about, we gotta go. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1805.76s)]
*  I would love to hear from a doctor [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1808.96s)]
*  who performs these surgeries. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1813.04s)]
*  Like how did you end up in this specific thing [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1814.48s)]
*  experimenting on kids? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1817.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm curious, like how do you decide to do that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1819.48s)]
*  And why? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1822.76s)]
*  And I'm always thinking they were probably [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1824.56s)]
*  the worst med student and it was the only thing left. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1826.12s)]
*  But Greg, it's not just, it's not with, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1829.36s)]
*  I know we gotta go, but it's not with kids. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1830.96s)]
*  But look how many people do, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1832.0s)]
*  will bring these women in for plastic surgery [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1833.4s)]
*  and they know they have no skin left on their face at all. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1835.48s)]
*  They'll still do it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1838.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like why is JB dying on this hill? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1839.0400000000002s)]
*  But then he would die on any hill. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1842.72s)]
*  Exit on that beautiful joke. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  The Dems new love affair, next. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_yjVfcp3dE&t=1848.52s)]
