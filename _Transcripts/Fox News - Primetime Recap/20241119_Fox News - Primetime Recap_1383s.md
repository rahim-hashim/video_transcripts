# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 18, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0)
*  Kamala Harris smashed the Democratic Party to pieces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=0.0s)]
*  with a $2 billion hammer. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=2.64s)]
*  Now the kingmakers are tearing each other apart, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=4.64s)]
*  trying to seize control and rebuild the party [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  from the bottom up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  But what's the Democratic Party without any money? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=10.94s)]
*  Kamala burned through $100 million a week [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=13.38s)]
*  during her little campaign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=16.88s)]
*  Now Democrats are in debt. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=18.42s)]
*  She didn't win a single swing state [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=20.52s)]
*  and was the first Democrat to lose the popular vote [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=22.36s)]
*  in 20 years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=24.82s)]
*  So what Kamala do with her billions? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=26.26s)]
*  New reporting from the Times shows Kamala gave $2 million [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=28.68s)]
*  to influencers and spent $10 million on concerts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=31.82s)]
*  Kamala blew $900 grand to put her face [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=35.72s)]
*  on the Las Vegas sphere. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  And originally it was reported she paid Oprah [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=40.22s)]
*  a million for an interview. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=42.36s)]
*  It's actually $2.5 million. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=44.34s)]
*  They built a venue for a rally in Pittsburgh, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=46.7s)]
*  but then had to tear it down because the Secret Service [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=49.5s)]
*  told them it wasn't secure. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=51.78s)]
*  If only they'd done that in Butler. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=53.58s)]
*  More than a half a mil went to Al Sharpton [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=56.14s)]
*  and Roland Martin, both people who just so happened [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  to give softball interviews to Kamala. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=61.34s)]
*  I'm not sure it's connected at all. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=63.68s)]
*  And she spent thousands on Uber Eats and ice cream. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=65.92s)]
*  I guess Joe's holdovers liked ice cream [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=69.68s)]
*  just as much as the big guy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=71.56s)]
*  While Kamala was eating dessert [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=73.58s)]
*  and making her friends richer, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=74.86s)]
*  her staffers were getting stiffed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=76.16s)]
*  Kamala stopped paying some of her top staffers [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=81.12s)]
*  And now the DNC is firing hundreds of employees. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=82.5s)]
*  The staffers are furious. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=86.0s)]
*  One told Axios, quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=87.82s)]
*  if they want to be the party of the working people, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=89.52s)]
*  they should have more respect for their workers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=92.1s)]
*  There's an inauthenticity of how they talk about workers [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  and clearly voters feel the same thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  The heads are rolling and the Democrat grunts are revolting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=101.2s)]
*  To us, it's obvious why Kamala lost. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  But some people are still scratching their heads. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  I don't know why the Democrats lost. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand why prices have come down, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=114.2s)]
*  the economy is good. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=119.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why they voted against her, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=121.5s)]
*  against the party. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=126.14000000000001s)]
*  Others are still saying Kamala lost [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=128.28s)]
*  because America's sexist. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=130.38s)]
*  He's a great candidate, a great resume, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=132.68s)]
*  but in some people's minds, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=136.02s)]
*  anybody that's not white and male is lousy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=138.02s)]
*  And we know that to be the case in this country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=142.82s)]
*  But Slick Willie says Americans aren't sexist. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=146.18s)]
*  We love women, just the right kind. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  I think it would probably be easier [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  for a conservative Republican woman to win. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=155.56s)]
*  Democrats are off message [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=159.76s)]
*  and they don't have a leader to bring them together. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=161.4s)]
*  Look, I think Democrats are in the wilderness. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=164.44s)]
*  As you just said before, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=166.1s)]
*  there is no clear leader of the party. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=167.3s)]
*  Joe Biden is gonna be out of office shortly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=169.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris just lost the election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of governors and other people [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=174.08s)]
*  who might emerge, maybe people we don't know about yet. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=175.72s)]
*  But there is no clear leader of the party right now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a power struggle behind the scenes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=181.16s)]
*  in the Democrat party right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=183.12s)]
*  They already told Pelosi to take a seat [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  and now AOC is telling Obama to take a hike. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people wanna bring Obama era insiders [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  back for party building purposes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=194.94s)]
*  While those folks ran successful presidential campaigns, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=197.14s)]
*  they also oversaw some of the largest down ballot losses [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=200.33999999999997s)]
*  in modern times. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Party building is different. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=204.61999999999998s)]
*  Look to people with recent successes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  Obama used to be a Democrat darling, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  but this election ruined his rep. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=212.26s)]
*  But boy, Obama during this Kamala Harris administration, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=215.61999999999998s)]
*  it changed my opinion of that guy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=218.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=222.2s)]
*  Did you have a high opinion of him before? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=223.44s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=224.26s)]
*  I did just as an intelligent person, a statesman, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=225.6s)]
*  but watching him just straight up lie about Trump, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  the thing that got me was that very fine people thing, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  the white supremacist thing, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=235.64s)]
*  they just kept trying to say that he was a racist, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=236.77999999999997s)]
*  which is this thing that I think worked in like 2017. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=239.61999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  I think it worked back then. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=245.76s)]
*  I don't think it works anymore. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=246.6s)]
*  I don't think people believe it anymore. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=247.92s)]
*  I think that we've gotten numb to all this stuff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  Obama couped Biden and then Kamala Kamikaze, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=253.0s)]
*  the entire party. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=255.8s)]
*  Republicans have the House and the Senate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=257.56s)]
*  and Trump's cabinet nominations are rolling out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=259.66s)]
*  Federman says Democrats have to chill. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=262.14s)]
*  It's still not even not even Thanksgiving yet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=265.2s)]
*  And if we're having meltdowns, you know, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=267.44s)]
*  every tweet or every appointment or all those things, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=269.38s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna be four years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=272.18s)]
*  Democrats need to stop panicking. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=275.38s)]
*  Stop talking, start listening. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=277.46s)]
*  We lost. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=281.02s)]
*  And I just want to say this to the Democrats, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  two minutes favor, shut the up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=286.62s)]
*  When you win, you get to say what you want to. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=291.28s)]
*  When you lose, you need to shut the hell up. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=293.76s)]
*  And when Democrats start listening [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  and they don't like what they hear, debate, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  don't censor and smear. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=301.4s)]
*  They've purged everybody they disagreed with [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=303.26s)]
*  from their party and had no idea they were gonna lose [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=305.53999999999996s)]
*  because they only talk amongst themselves. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=309.2s)]
*  And it helps if you're a little more likable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=312.04s)]
*  Stop screaming at people to get with the program [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=315.98s)]
*  and instead make a program worth getting with. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=318.48s)]
*  And a good first step toward that goal [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=321.92s)]

*  One Democrat told Politico, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=332.65999999999997s)]

*  like they've branded us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=336.5s)]
*  Moderate Democrats are making a play [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=338.36s)]

*  that Democrats tried so hard to manufacture [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=355.38s)]
*  during the election that ended up being a lot of hate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=358.52s)]
*  is now spreading in reality across the country, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=361.52s)]
*  but it is not coming from the left. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=364.82s)]
*  Americans from every race, religion, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=366.79999999999995s)]

*  And coming up, we're gonna play the president-elect [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  at his big entrance this weekend [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=379.97999999999996s)]

*  Joe Biden, ever made it out of the rainforest. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=387.96s)]

*  Well, most anti-Trump hosts, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  and that is the co-host of Liberal Joe, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=401.76s)]

*  at their request with Donald Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=412.46s)]
*  Joe and I went to Mar-a-Lago to meet personally [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=413.88s)]
*  with president-elect Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=417.44s)]
*  It was the first time we have seen him in seven years. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=419.17999999999995s)]
*  That we didn't see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  and we told him so. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=428.1s)]
*  What we did agree on was to restart communications. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=429.66s)]
*  In this meeting, president Trump was tearful. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=434.14s)]
*  He was upbeat. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  He seemed interested in finding common ground [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=441.52s)]
*  And for those asking why we would go speak [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=444.66s)]
*  to the president-elect during such fraught times, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=448.02s)]
*  especially between us, I guess I would ask back, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=450.76s)]
*  why wouldn't we? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  All right, they must have spent three days [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=457.52s)]
*  working on what they were gonna say [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=459.68s)]
*  after they had that meeting. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=460.96s)]
*  All right, a few days ago, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=462.34s)]
*  these two far-left radical hosts [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=463.78s)]
*  were comparing Trump to Hitler, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=466.58s)]
*  calling him a racist and sexist and fascist, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=468.44s)]
*  and now they're kissing his ass, sucking up to him, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=471.56s)]
*  and having breakfast at Donald Trump's house [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=474.64s)]
*  at their request, really? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=477.38s)]
*  Mika said the election was literally [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=479.02s)]
*  a battle of life and death. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=481.56s)]
*  For eight-plus long years, these two Trump haters [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=483.7s)]
*  have filled their morning program [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  with anti-Trump hysteria, conspiracy theory [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=489.88s)]
*  after conspiracy theory. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=492.78s)]
*  I could fill an entire three-hour show. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=494.7s)]
*  I could do three nights in a row [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=497.7s)]
*  just playing clips of their insane, over-the-top, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=500.02s)]
*  anti-Trump rage, hatred, name-calling conspiracies. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=504.0s)]
*  I am being gracious in the spirit of joy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=509.56s)]
*  I'm only going to make you suffer through [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=512.16s)]
*  a very tiny example to make a point. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=514.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=517.5s)]
*  I could go back and talk about Nazi Germany, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=518.92s)]
*  and I'd do it without any concerns whatsoever. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=521.0s)]
*  And if people can't start drawing the parallels, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=524.12s)]
*  well, you're just stupid, or you have your head in the sand, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  or you're one of them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=529.4s)]
*  It's just staggering that people that I know, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=530.76s)]
*  people that I grew up with, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=533.8s)]
*  could still even consider voting for this autocrat. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=536.22s)]
*  As important as Trump's fascism is, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=539.86s)]
*  and is the lead story every day, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=544.38s)]
*  his cozying up to dictators, his obsession with Hitler, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=546.1400000000001s)]
*  but this is what voters know right now, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  that he is killing us. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about us women. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=557.7s)]
*  He's killing us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=559.7800000000001s)]
*  Killing them. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  The big question tonight is, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=563.62s)]
*  why would you want to be with the murderer, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=564.82s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mussolini? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=566.36s)]
*  After all that, I'm not sure why Donald Trump [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  would meet with Joe and Mika. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=572.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe the president does want to be magnanimous. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=574.2s)]
*  Maybe he wants to bring the country together. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=577.12s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  When I interview him, I will ask him that question, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=580.3000000000001s)]
*  and if I find out ahead of time, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll bring that answer to you. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, can anyone just for a second imagine [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=586.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris agreeing to meet with yours truly [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=589.7800000000001s)]
*  after if she had, God forbid, thank God, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=594.16s)]
*  you didn't let this happen, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=596.92s)]
*  if she won the election after we spent all that time [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=598.36s)]
*  on this show exposing her in her own words, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  her radicalism, her extremism, her utter incompetence [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  night after night after night, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=610.04s)]
*  and for the record, by the way, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=611.8s)]
*  we invited her on this show. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=613.16s)]
*  I offered her three hours of radio, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  one hour of TV during the campaign. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=616.76s)]
*  We never heard back. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=620.24s)]
*  And she's still welcome. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=622.48s)]
*  You're gonna have three hours of radio, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=624.12s)]
*  one hour uninterrupted right here on Fox News with me. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=629.88s)]
*  And anyway, it looks like Donald Trump, unlike Kamala, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=631.36s)]
*  and most everyone else on the radical left, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=634.38s)]
*  is actually serious about trying to unite the country. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=636.92s)]
*  My unsolicited advice, not that anyone listens to me, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=639.96s)]
*  I'm just the talk show host, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=643.16s)]
*  is that this is a complete waste of time, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=644.36s)]
*  and it's just gonna be a matter of how many days [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=647.28s)]
*  until they start calling you a Nazi and a fascist again, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  but maybe, maybe, just maybe, he's not the monster [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=652.2399999999999s)]
*  the state-run legacy media mob portrayed, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  or is it possible they have become enlightened [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=659.8599999999999s)]
*  and the light has gone on, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=664.3s)]
*  maybe they have come to the realization that legacy media, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=665.76s)]
*  the mob that spoke in unison, late night comedy, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=669.8s)]
*  every major newspaper, liberal cable news channels, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=673.16s)]
*  three broadcast channels, is completely dead, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=676.06s)]
*  and people have lost all trust in them, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=680.04s)]
*  and they have no influence, there's no celebrity influence, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=681.6s)]
*  because that was proven to be true this election. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=684.88s)]
*  Or maybe they're simply building out relationships [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=687.62s)]
*  any way, anywhere they can. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=691.28s)]
*  There have been reports that I have read [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=694.04s)]

*  They don't trust the network you work for, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=853.08s)]

*  when China and Russia have hypersonic technology, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1077.68s)]
*  and we don't. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1081.4s)]
*  That deficiency needs to be rectified immediately, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1082.76s)]
*  and we better spend the money to fix it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1086.2s)]
*  And breaking, you know, with usual norms, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1088.52s)]
*  Biden is already trying to, what, box Trump in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1091.0800000000002s)]
*  with his latest authorization in Ukraine, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  supplying the country last minute, out the door, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  with long-range missiles to escalate [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1099.64s)]
*  the battle between Russia and Ukraine [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1102.48s)]
*  so Ukraine can attack the interior of Russia, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  knowing Donald Trump wants to end this war, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1108.4399999999998s)]
*  and so Biden is actively undermining [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1111.52s)]
*  Trump's chances of success, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1113.9599999999998s)]
*  while simultaneously increasing the odds [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1116.04s)]
*  of a broader conflict in Europe, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1118.6s)]
*  while also denying help to our biggest ally [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1120.6s)]
*  in the Middle East, Israel. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1123.56s)]
*  There is no doubt Donald Trump is inheriting [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1125.1999999999998s)]
*  an absolute mess from Biden and Harris, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1128.08s)]
*  both at home and abroad, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  but you, the American people, elected the guy [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1132.44s)]
*  that is gonna go in, he's gonna fix what's broken, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1135.96s)]
*  the left will scream bloody murder, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1139.2s)]
*  the institutionalists won't like it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1142.04s)]
*  It is exactly what he intends to do, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1144.88s)]
*  and it is exactly what the country voted for. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1147.28s)]
*  It's a question echoing throughout the liberal verse. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1151.24s)]
*  Why don't we have a Rogan? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1154.96s)]
*  Where's our Elon? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1156.16s)]
*  Well, it's simple, you had Rogan, you had Elon. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1157.56s)]
*  You even had me in college, but who didn't? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1160.32s)]
*  Back then, all it took was a lukewarm Zima. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1164.44s)]
*  Truth is, in the intolerant world the Dems created, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1173.08s)]
*  no one like Rogan or Musk can exist, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1176.12s)]
*  and that's because to attract people like that, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1178.52s)]
*  you need freedom of thought, or hell, any thought at all. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1180.2s)]
*  So how did the Democrat Party get here? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1183.52s)]
*  Well, first it was the lazy way out, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1185.92s)]
*  rather than making policies that benefit Americans, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1188.0s)]
*  they slid mindlessly into the toxic bath [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1190.32s)]
*  of identity politics. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1193.36s)]
*  This wasn't thinking, it was a cessation of thought, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1194.92s)]
*  like when you're in a coma or watching Fox and Friends. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1198.04s)]
*  Aw. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1200.96s)]
*  Aw, shut up. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1202.8s)]
*  Their discussions were never about what can we fix, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1206.08s)]
*  or what can we create, instead they began and ended with [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1208.8s)]
*  who I am, and why it makes me better than you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1212.04s)]
*  They turned everything into an identity pissing contest [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1215.76s)]
*  with their egos as a diuretic. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1219.24s)]
*  Now if you could claim some intersectionality, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1221.76s)]
*  you were a neighborhood celebrity, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1223.92s)]
*  especially if that neighborhood was a college campus [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1225.44s)]
*  or a newsroom, but as these scolds got louder and louder [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1227.96s)]
*  and more of our media invertebrates cowered into line, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1231.48s)]
*  the resistance started to look a lot like [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1234.64s)]
*  the First Amendment. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  Ordinary people wanted the freedom from being canceled, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1238.76s)]
*  and that's where the Musks and Rogans came from. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1241.72s)]
*  They were the revolution, they were the resistance. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1244.56s)]
*  So you can't be the resistance when you're the machine [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1247.72s)]
*  controlling all thought. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1250.24s)]
*  It's why they couldn't create their own Rush Limbaugh [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1252.6s)]
*  or their own Twitter. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1254.6s)]
*  The left turned into everything they used to hate [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1256.28s)]
*  about the right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1258.84s)]
*  It's been the ugliest transition since Admiral Levine [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1260.12s)]
*  turned in his boots for pumps. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1263.24s)]
*  The machine can't make its own resistance. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1267.6s)]
*  The resistant leaves, and you're left with humorless [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1270.48s)]
*  hectoring hags like Joy Reid, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1273.68s)]
*  who's shedding viewers faster than her hair. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  So are the Dems ready to give up and grow up? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1279.4s)]
*  Well here's Jen Psaki doubling down that dissent [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1282.04s)]
*  is disinformation that must be regulated. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1284.88s)]
*  One of the things that's changed, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  even since I got involved in politics, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1289.76s)]
*  is just the rise of the percentage of people [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1291.8400000000001s)]
*  who get their information off of platforms [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1295.1200000000001s)]
*  that have no fact checking mechanism [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1298.0s)]
*  and no accountability for having disinformation spread. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1300.44s)]
*  Laws have to change. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1303.92s)]
*  I don't even know the total answer to it, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1305.16s)]
*  but that seems to me to be a core issue. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1307.24s)]
*  That was on Katie Couric's podcast, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1310.3600000000001s)]
*  which is slightly more thoughtful than our colonoscopy. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1312.68s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1317.72s)]
*  Still, they embrace censorship rather than figure out [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1320.16s)]
*  what they did wrong. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1322.68s)]
*  But there's another reason the Democrat media complex [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1323.88s)]
*  can't change, ego. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1326.16s)]
*  Rather than identify with real people, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1328.2s)]
*  they chose to please the peers in their industry [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1330.12s)]
*  because that's where the cocktail party is. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1332.76s)]
*  That's where they can impress people [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1334.84s)]
*  who might write about them in Vanity Fair. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1336.2399999999998s)]
*  Their egos need that. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1338.28s)]
*  So they mirrored each other's assumptions. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1340.12s)]
*  It was a giant circle jerk, emphasis on jerk. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1341.8s)]
*  But as they no longer identified with real people, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1345.36s)]
*  an orange billionaire with brass balls [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1347.9199999999998s)]
*  and a willingness to call bulls**t did. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  And by standing up and yelling fight, fight, fight, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1353.4399999999998s)]
*  he attracted renegades inspired by his fearlessness. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1355.56s)]
*  You saw them at the UFC, on the street, at football games. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1359.2s)]
*  They're no longer afraid to speak their minds. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1362.96s)]
*  And if you don't like it, cool, there's the door [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1365.28s)]
*  if you can fit your fat ass through it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1367.4s)]
*  Let's go! [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1369.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's go! [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj8h_35Xu0&t=1370.2s)]
