# Fox News Highlights - April 2nd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight, liberating us from decline. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=4.4s)]
*  The scene at the White House today was something to behold. You had steelworkers, pipefitters, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=9.8s)]
*  autoworkers and mechanics, the people who make American industry run. They were gathered [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=17.6s)]
*  in the Rose Garden to watch President Trump announce and sign his executive order that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=24.12s)]
*  aims to make trade fair again. And we were there to watch it all unfold. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=28.7s)]
*  My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. Waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025 will [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=34.1s)]
*  forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=44.26s)]
*  was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=50.9s)]
*  And President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on virtually every major exporting country [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=58.86s)]
*  in the world, calculated by adding the foreign nation's tariffs plus the value of any trade [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  barriers that they have in place. Kind of ingenious. And then in turn, we charged them [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  half of that amount. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=75.14s)]
*  This is one of the most important days in my opinion in American history. It's our [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=77.9s)]
*  declaration of economic independence. For years, hardworking American citizens were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=89.9s)]
*  But now it's our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=97.5s)]
*  to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  He also addressed what I call the myth perceptions about tariffs peddled by his critics. Now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=107.7s)]
*  how many times have you heard that a tariff is a tax? But of course, that's facile thinking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  Even if foreign manufacturers try to pass on some of their price hikes to consumers, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=120.42s)]
*  you got to consider the broader picture. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=124.94s)]
*  Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country and you see it happening [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=127.86s)]
*  already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=132.02s)]
*  markets and break down foreign trade barriers. And ultimately more production at home will [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=143.94s)]
*  age of America. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=151.02s)]
*  And I have to give a great shout out to my great friend Pat Buchanan, who back in decades [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  ago, but also recently in 2019, put it best. He said a tariff is a tax, but its purpose [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  is not just to raise revenue, but to make a nation economically independent of others [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=165.14s)]
*  and to bring its citizens to rely upon each other rather than on foreign entities. Again, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  the word independent is really key. Now when I was a little kid, almost nothing we bought [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=176.76s)]
*  from toys to TVs were made outside the United States. I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=182.42s)]
*  dolls, believe it or not, I'm going to give them to my kids someday. They were all made [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=187.86s)]
*  in the USA. And even clothes, my class spirit shirt from college, made in the USA. But [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  then globalization meant that we made fewer things, lost millions of jobs, all so we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=199.98s)]
*  could buy more of everything from electronics to pet products at a lower per piece cost. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=205.68s)]
*  And if we learn nothing, nothing else from the COVID nightmare, it should be that we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=213.36s)]
*  need to reshore the manufacturing of our critical supply chain. The president talked about this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=217.6s)]
*  today, PPE, antibiotics, other pharmaceuticals, many of them made in China. Now another myth [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=222.84s)]
*  that Trump is starting, that Trump is like starting a big trade war. Well, the truth [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=229.84s)]
*  is we've been in the midst of a trade war for almost 50 years now and losing it badly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=235.12s)]
*  The trade deficits speak for themselves. 81% of the cars in South Korea are made in South [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=241.22s)]
*  Korea. 94% of the cars in Japan are made in Japan. Toyota sells one million foreign made [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=247.18s)]
*  automobiles into the United States and General Motors sells almost none. Ford sells very [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=255.5s)]
*  little. None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries. Such horrendous [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=261.58s)]
*  imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=267.5s)]
*  You bet it has. A lot of Americans don't even know those facts. It was very educational [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=275.11999999999995s)]
*  to listen to the president today. And for all the tough talk on the global scene, key [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  countries are already beginning to see the light. Let's sit down and discuss this because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=284.52s)]
*  it's just going to hurt American jobs. Do you think it's fair that you have tariffs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  on a whole number of products? That's right. And we'd be willing to take those off tomorrow [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=295.3s)]
*  if he took all the tariffs off. Does President Trump know that you'd be prepared to do that? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=300.18s)]
*  He knows. And Secretary Lutnick knows that we're willing to take these tariffs off like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  in the next minute if he said he's taking their tariffs off. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=310.14s)]
*  Okay, we're waiting. Now the bottom line is any economic hit we collectively take is temporary [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=315.14s)]
*  and should not be seen in isolation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  Apple is going to spend $500 billion. NVIDIA, a hot company, is investing hundreds of billions [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  of dollars. Johnson & Johnson, great company, $55 billion. Eli Lilly, $27 billion. Metta, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=332.7s)]
*  CMA, CGM, $20 billion. General Motors, GE Aerospace, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai are all [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=340.58s)]
*  putting in billions and billions of dollars. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=348.58s)]
*  Now one of my favorite moments of the day came early on when Trump brought up one of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=352.14s)]
*  the UAW workers to speak. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=356.02s)]
*  I have watched my entire life. I have watched plant after plant after plant in Detroit and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=359.34s)]
*  in the metro Detroit area close. There are now plants sitting idle. There are now plants [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=365.9s)]
*  that are underutilized. And Donald Trump's policies are going to bring product back into [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=371.38s)]
*  those underutilized plants. There's going to be new investment. There's going to be [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=377.38s)]
*  new plants built. In six months or a year we're going to begin to see the benefits. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=381.34s)]
*  I can't wait to see what's happening three or four years down the road. Thank you, Mr. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=385.94s)]
*  President. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=389.94s)]
*  Now that was just a beautiful moment. The World Trade Organization was founded in 1995, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=390.94s)]
*  30 years ago. We allowed China to join the WTO in 2000. So the free traders, purists, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  have had their way for most of that time. And we know how it worked out. Five million [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=406.22s)]
*  manufacturing jobs lost as the outsourcers and the foreign companies got rich. Trump [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=412.18s)]
*  said this today. Look, I campaigned on this. The entire 2024 campaign, he told the voters [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=419.18s)]
*  that this is what he was planning to do, to make America great again by ending the great [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  foreign ripoff of America. And now he deserves a chance to implement this program and demonstrate [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=429.38s)]
*  to the voters that it can work. So Republicans, I know you're watching, don't even think about [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=435.9s)]
*  blocking this on Capitol Hill. And the courts, they should not be enjoining this either. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=441.9s)]
*  Let's see how the markets settle out over the next six months. Let's see how other countries [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=448.14s)]
*  and their major companies react. Five American presidents helped dig us into this trade deficit [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=452.18s)]
*  hole that we currently find ourselves in, and only one, Donald Trump, had the guts to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  try to dig us out. And that's the angle. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=464.26000000000005s)]
*  Happy Liberation Day. My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. Waiting for a long [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  time. April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=476.06s)]
*  day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=487.1s)]
*  again. Today, Donald Trump fundamentally changed the country as we know it. This is the biggest [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=494.1s)]
*  shift in economic policy since World War II, when we liberated Europe and Asia. 47 says [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=499.3s)]
*  we're now liberating ourselves from globalization. Our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=505.42s)]
*  and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. American steelworkers, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=511.66s)]
*  auto workers, farmers, and skilled craftsmen, we have a lot of them here with us today. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=518.66s)]
*  They really suffered gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=524.1s)]
*  our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=529.7s)]
*  torn apart our once beautiful American dream. This is one of the most important days in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=535.78s)]
*  my opinion in American history. It's our declaration of economic independence. After [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=541.22s)]
*  we saved Europe from Hitler and Asia from the Emperor, we created a free trade system [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=548.6600000000001s)]
*  to help the allies' economies recover, and they'd help us contain communism. And life [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=553.02s)]
*  was great for American families. Wives didn't have to work if they didn't want to. You could [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=558.1s)]
*  own a nice home, have a big family, afford college on a decent salary, and your kids [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=562.7s)]
*  could have a better life than you. The United States finally won the Cold War, gave birth [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=567.38s)]
*  to globalization, and then other countries, even our allies, took advantage of us, took [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=572.5s)]
*  advantage of a system we designed to save and protect them. China, a country we basically [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=577.54s)]
*  created, became an absolute menace, and American multinationals conspired to ship jobs and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=583.86s)]
*  factories overseas and decimated the middle class. If you're one of those workers the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=590.6s)]
*  last 40 years, free trade basically destroyed your life. Look at this chart. The top 50% [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=595.78s)]
*  of income earners, especially the top 10%, accumulated a massive amount of wealth. But [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=602.1s)]
*  the other half of the country, the bottom 50% of earners, have been suffocating at the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=608.14s)]
*  bottom. The American dream's been dying, and politicians said there's nothing they could [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=612.74s)]
*  do about it. Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back. That he's [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=617.74s)]

*  important. I could have one man say, we're going to tax you 25%. And I could say another, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=686.5s)]
*  listen you mother f*****, we're going to tax you 25%. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  Trump's been talking about winning trade wars since the nineties. He raised tariffs in his [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=699.34s)]
*  first term and we had the highest wage growth in 50 years, a manufacturing renaissance and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=702.98s)]
*  a hot stock market. Oh, and no inflation. And this term, he's going even bigger. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=707.9s)]
*  China first row, China, 67%. That's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=715.38s)]
*  and trade barriers. We're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%. I think, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=724.54s)]
*  in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=730.86s)]
*  be upset? They will be because we never charged anybody anything, but now we're going to charge. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=734.5s)]
*  European Union, they're very tough, very, very tough traders. 39%, we're going to charge [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=740.02s)]
*  them 20%. And again, I don't blame the people for doing it. It's, I think they're very smart [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=745.58s)]

*  Americans have been demanding fair trade for years. So if other countries tax our products, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=753.58s)]
*  we're just going to tax theirs. But Trump's giving everybody a little bit of a discount, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=758.68s)]
*  10% tariff across the board, and then just a cut under what they charge us. That's a [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  negotiation tactic. Get other countries to drop their tariffs to where we have them and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  then it's equal. That's called fair trade. But we're going to fight harder against foreign [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=773.8s)]
*  cars. Trump announcing a 25% tariff on all autos from other countries and the workers [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=779.28s)]
*  love it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=784.8199999999999s)]

*  be all in on the trade war. But since he's the general of the war, Democrats who claim [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=825.1999999999999s)]

*  of tariffs on all sorts of goods Americans purchase every day. A tsunami of tariffs. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=840.18s)]
*  Let's be clear. Donald Trump's tariffs are a tax hike on American families. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=847.62s)]
*  Wall Street money put Schumer in the Senate so he's just a puppet. Schumer and company [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=853.62s)]
*  drove up prices to 40 year highs. They've been raising taxes for decades. The man who [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=857.5799999999999s)]
*  was complicit in hijacking 100,000 American factories and losing 5 million jobs overseas [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=863.38s)]
*  can shut up with all due respect. He destroyed American industry. That's why we call it [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=869.16s)]
*  the rust belt. That's why Trump was elected twice to stop Schumer's gang from carving [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=874.68s)]
*  this country up. The media says Americans can't afford tariffs. We can't afford not [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=879.56s)]
*  to have tariffs. We created a monster in China. They dump cheap products here. They steal [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=885.56s)]
*  our secrets. They poison us with drugs and they killed a million Americans with a virus. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=891.14s)]
*  Trade policy should align with foreign policy. The pandemic proved this country isn't even [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=897.24s)]
*  self-sufficient. We have to start making our medicine here and if we want to build ships [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=901.92s)]
*  and icebreakers, they have to be built with American steel, not cheap subsidized steel [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=906.72s)]
*  dumped here from China. And if we're going to win the AI arms race, we can't rely on [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=912.48s)]
*  Taiwan for semiconductors. We've got to make the chips here. If we don't protect our economy, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=917.54s)]
*  we can't protect our national security and we can't protect American lives. The United [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=923.44s)]
*  States can no longer produce enough antibiotics to treat our sick. We import virtually all [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=928.8800000000001s)]
*  of our computers, phones, televisions and electronics. We used to dominate the field [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=935.2s)]
*  and now we import it all from different countries. A single shipyard in China now produces more [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=940.6s)]
*  ships every year than all of the American shipyards combined. Think of that. And it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=946.36s)]
*  was a business that we used to dominate. We used to dominate it totally. In short, chronic [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=952.16s)]
*  trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem. They're a national emergency. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=957.24s)]
*  America used to be an industrial powerhouse. It's how we won World War II. We beat the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=963.6s)]
*  Germans and the Japanese on opposite sides of the planet at the same time. And what made [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=968.18s)]
*  us such an industrial powerhouse were tariffs. Is America an industrial powerhouse anymore? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=973.8s)]
*  No. We can't win two wars at the same time anymore. So in order to rebuild, we need to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=980.16s)]
*  have protection from foreign predators. And our trading partners and neighbors need us [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=986.0s)]
*  more than we need them. Canada was just playing a silly little game of chicken until they [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=991.18s)]
*  realized Trump was serious. And now they're announcing they'll lower their tariffs if [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=995.92s)]
*  we lower ours. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  We'd be willing to take those off tomorrow if he took all the tariffs off. We are not [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1002.48s)]

*  need. We don't want tariffs. He knows and Secretary Lutnick knows that we're willing [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1016.56s)]
*  to take these tariffs off like in the next minute if he said he's taking their tariffs [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1021.24s)]
*  off. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1027.2s)]
*  Mexico says they won't go tit for tat on tariffs with Trump. Israel's removed all tariffs on [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1028.2s)]
*  American products. Vietnam just cut duties on gas and cars. The world got called out [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1032.3s)]
*  and they're starting to fall in line. Three trillion dollars in private investments poured [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1038.06s)]
*  into this country since Trump announced the trade war. And that's more money than Biden [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1042.3799999999999s)]
*  spent on chips, infrastructure and the Green New Deal combined. And he spent your money. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1046.18s)]
*  And what did he build? Nothing. Build back better? Never happened. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1052.18s)]
*  Bidonomics with open borders, outsourcing and record spending was throttling this country [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1057.46s)]
*  to the brink of a recession. This administration says they're rescuing the economy from a recession. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1061.76s)]
*  The stock market can't get a handle on any of this because they don't know if Trump's [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1068.06s)]
*  tariffs are long term or just a negotiating tactic. And companies need to plan years ahead. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1071.48s)]
*  But Wall Street's going to be fine. And everyone's investments are going to be fine long term. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1077.92s)]
*  This is an administration focused on Main Street, not Wall Street. The same people complaining [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  about tariffs never complained once when the middle class got savaged by other countries. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1088.44s)]
*  In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsourcers and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1094.1200000000001s)]

*  one of the most important days in my opinion in American history. It's our declaration [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1292.92s)]
*  of economic independence. For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1299.7800000000002s)]
*  sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it's our [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1305.74s)]
*  turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1313.22s)]
*  and pay down our national debt and it will all happen very quickly. If you want your [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1319.84s)]
*  tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America because there [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1325.38s)]
*  is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America. All of the foreign presidents, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1329.82s)]
*  prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1335.46s)]
*  to ask for exemptions from these tariffs. I say terminate your own tariffs, drop your [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1340.54s)]
*  barriers, don't manipulate your currencies. They manipulate their currencies like nobody [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1346.8600000000001s)]
*  can even believe, which is a bad, bad thing and very devastating to us and start buying [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1353.06s)]
*  tens of billions of dollars of American goods. And he said we can no longer unilaterally [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1358.54s)]
*  economically surrender. Now let's be clear about one thing. We're supposed to be the [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1365.2s)]
*  land of the free, the home of the brave, right? America didn't just magically become the single [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  greatest country God ever gave man by allowing other countries to walk all over us, rip us [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1375.92s)]
*  off and take advantage of us. And now thanks to President Trump, well, the world's free [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  riot is now over. Now free trade is a two-way street. The president wants free and fair [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1386.8200000000002s)]
*  trade, but they don't want free and fair trade. While the U.S. imposed low or zero tariffs [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1391.96s)]
*  from products around the world, American exports were heavily taxed, throttled and even blocked [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1398.16s)]
*  altogether. We have been ripped off by countries all over this world for decades, friends and [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1404.0400000000002s)]
*  foes alike. Those days are thankfully now as of tonight over. Look at your screen. Here [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  are the new reciprocal tariffs for each country around the world compared to the tariffs that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1416.76s)]
*  they already impose on our products, American products. On the blue column, well, this is [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1422.24s)]
*  what American businesses faced when trying to enter a foreign market. A nearly 40% tax [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1428.2s)]
*  from the European Union. I thought they were our friends. 50% Japan, South Korea, India, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1434.72s)]
*  61% Switzerland, 72% Thailand, 64% Indonesia, Canada absolutely screws our dairy farmers [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1440.76s)]
*  and our meat producers. That's not very neighborly, if you ask me. And the list, we'll keep scrolling, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1451.48s)]
*  it goes on and on. Make no mistakes. These are massive, massive taxes and markups designed [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1457.16s)]
*  to make American products uncompetitive. They're hurting our ranchers, they're hurting our [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1464.28s)]
*  farmers, they're hurting our manufacturers, they're hurting our auto industry. Look, for [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1469.06s)]
*  example, the top of the list, China's tariff against American imports, it's 64%. That's [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1474.26s)]
*  not free and fair trade. And by the way, how is this fair in any way? Why are we making [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1480.62s)]
*  China and all these other countries rich? We can make all of these products here in [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1485.86s)]
*  America. And don't you want a president that's advocating for and defending American workers, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1490.7s)]
*  American businesses, American products around the globe? All these countries want access [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1497.7s)]
*  to the what, 360 million Americans? They want access to our markets so they can make more [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1502.74s)]
*  money? And by the way, spare me all the hand wringing. Well, what about Canada and the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1508.5800000000002s)]
*  European Union? They're our friends. We spend a trillion dollars a year, your money, to [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1513.7s)]
*  protect them from worldwide threats. We eclipse all of their NATO spending combined. We spend [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1520.7s)]
*  billions in research, development on state of the art weapons that they end up using. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1527.7s)]
*  We provide that to them. When Ukraine was attacked, we provided the majority of the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1534.02s)]
*  funding and the weapons to fight back against Russia. Hundreds of billions of your dollars. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1539.1000000000001s)]
*  When I suspected a spy balloon was over Canada, it was American planes that shot it down. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1545.14s)]
*  Why? Because Canada's aging planes, they couldn't get altitude high enough. And just recently [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1550.18s)]
*  when European trade routes were blocked off by the hooty rebels, well, we were the ones [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1556.18s)]
*  that delivered a massive blow to Iran's proxy. It looks like we might be giving another one [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1561.14s)]
*  and it's not just defense that we're providing. Here's one of the reasons why our health care [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1566.46s)]
*  costs are so high. The U.S. develops almost all new drugs, all new medical technology, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1571.78s)]
*  all at a massive cost, while other countries with socialized medicine, they steal it, they [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1578.02s)]
*  hand it out for free and you pay full price. That sound fair? But it's somehow wrong to [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1583.6999999999998s)]
*  tax these countries that are putting massive taxes tariffs on us, the EU, Canada, what, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1590.6999999999998s)]
*  we're supposed to just take this? At some point this free ride must end. It's ending. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1597.6999999999998s)]
*  They should never get a free ride forever. But the good news once and for all to our [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1602.9799999999998s)]
*  international friends, there are two ways to make these tariffs go away. One, end the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1608.02s)]
*  tariffs on our products. That's free and fair trade. Two, make your products in the United [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1612.58s)]
*  States like Hyundai's doing, Mercedes is doing, BMW, Toyota, Nissan. Take a look at your screen. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1617.58s)]
*  There are many other massive companies that are now making products right here in America [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1624.18s)]
*  providing Americans high paying career jobs and they're setting up shop in the near future. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1628.5s)]
*  Even Rolls Royce is thinking about building engines here. To put it bluntly, those are [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1635.36s)]
*  jobs for you, the American people, for the hardworking Americans, for the people that [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1640.02s)]
*  make this country great and a more competitive product with zero tariffs. And of course, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1645.3s)]
*  Democrats, the legacy media mob, they're totally distraught as usual. If the dog bites, the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1651.66s)]
*  bee stings, you're feeling sad, you blame Trump. And the New York Times actually published [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1657.22s)]
*  a sob story about a Chinese factory owner whose business is now quieter than it should [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1662.82s)]
*  be. That's complete Adam Bullshif. I said it the right way. And meanwhile, Hakeem Jeffries [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1669.3s)]
*  is all but rooting for a recession. Listen. Republicans are crashing the American economy [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1675.54s)]
*  in real time and driving us to a recession. This is not liberation day, it's recession [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1683.22s)]
*  day in the United States of America. Cheering for failure, the party that once at least [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1690.42s)]
*  pretended to care about Americans and American workers while also ignoring inflation for [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1698.8600000000001s)]
*  four years, now suddenly uninterested in American jobs while deeply concerned with the costs [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1703.8600000000001s)]
*  of foreign goods. Take a look. Now he argued in a White House setting that this is a good [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1709.58s)]
*  thing for the United States. Called it even at one point a Rose Garden type celebration, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1716.22s)]
*  many others view it differently. And many sectors of our economy are bracing for an [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1724.14s)]
*  impact that has been universally described as likely negative for you, a regular consumer [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1728.78s)]
*  or taxpayer. The president is risking a recession with this national sales tax he calls tariffs. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1734.98s)]
*  Or just another tax which is very regressive. It's just a sales tax. It's now official. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1741.5s)]
*  The Democratic Party, the legacy media mob, they no longer represent the hardworking men [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1747.94s)]
*  and women in this country that make this country great. It is a party that is filled to the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1753.7s)]
*  brim with coastal elites in San Francisco, LA, New York, DC, Illinois, we'll include [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1758.74s)]
*  them. And by the way, people that likely never got their hands dirty, have never seen the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1765.26s)]
*  inside of a factory. Most of them probably don't even know how to use a lawn mower, much [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1770.1s)]
*  less sharpen the blades. But maybe, just maybe, they'd be willing to just, you know, maybe [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1775.26s)]
*  listen to even Biden's Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, who had this to say about the [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1781.98s)]
*  impact of tariffs on the American consumer, the opposite of what Democrats are saying [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1787.6s)]
*  now. There have been some experts, some groups, the National Retail Federation among them [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1792.3799999999999s)]
*  who have expressed concerns that it will be U.S. consumers who eventually end up paying [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1798.1s)]
*  for these tariffs. As you know, polling shows that rising prices are voters' biggest concern [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1803.3799999999999s)]
*  right now. So I'd ask you to speak directly to them. Will American consumers bear the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1808.02s)]
*  cost of these tariffs? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1812.74s)]
*  I don't believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1814.98s)]
*  that they face. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1822.3s)]
*  But once Yellen was right, but this is about more than prices for consumers. Papu Cannon [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1824.9s)]
*  pointed out in 2019, quote, tariffs are the taxes that made America great. The Tariff [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1831.22s)]
*  Act, signed into law by George Washington in 1789, protected American manufacturers. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1836.8600000000001s)]
*  It created a new thriving industrial sector in the Northeast in this country. The Founding [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1844.1000000000001s)]
*  Fathers also enacted the Tariff of 1816 that allowed Americans to generate its own textile [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1848.9s)]
*  market, all but blocking out competition from Great Britain. And in the early 1900s, a new [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1855.6200000000001s)]
*  tariff allowed multiple presidents to slash income taxes, which ignited the roaring 20s. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1861.1000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff is always blamed by the left for the Great [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1867.42s)]
*  Depression. One problem, the stock market crashed well before the tariff became law, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1872.94s)]
*  and as Buchanan pointed out, mismanagement from the Federal Reserve was the real villain [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1878.5s)]
*  of the Great Depression and not a tariff that wasn't even in effect. And remember this, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1883.06s)]
*  according to Buchanan, a tariff is a tax, but its purpose is not just to raise revenue, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1889.02s)]
*  but to make a nation economically independent of others and to bring its citizens to rely [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1894.66s)]
*  upon each other rather than foreign entities. Let me sum it up. America first. That is exactly [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1900.42s)]
*  why today is Liberation Day. It's a day that will be remembered as a turning point and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1907.52s)]
*  the start, I hope, for every American of a new golden age of American wealth and exceptionalism. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1912.6799999999998s)]
*  So they say hindsight is 2020. And if anybody in the media sees out of his hind end, it's [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  Joe Scarborough. He was once a Republican in Congress, but will be remembered as the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1925.26s)]
*  worst thing to happen to Florida since Ron Jeremy toured the villages. I know. But what [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1930.36s)]
*  I like most about Scarborough is his honesty. Well, that and his dime slot hillbilly eyes. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  Here he is on April Fool's Day, no less, talking about what a disaster Joe Biden was as president. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1945.8s)]
*  We always look back in retrospect and think things were a certain way just because it's [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1950.84s)]
*  the way the media at the time defined it. You know, I remember after Biden's shockingly [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1958.8s)]
*  bad presidential debate, that's when like the history books were starting. You know, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1964.48s)]
*  you could just see that was going to be the reason why he was pushed out of the race and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1969.72s)]
*  he was doing better. Oh, you could just see that was going to be the reason because there [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1973.28s)]
*  were no reasons before the debate. Oh, sorry, Joe. Saying the debate was like a shocking [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1977.6799999999998s)]
*  reason for Biden's downfall is like saying, Oh, I didn't know Hunter Biden was a problem [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1984.68s)]
*  until I saw his artwork. And what a convenient opinion to suddenly come up with that now [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1989.2s)]
*  that Biden is long gone. But that's what you get when the media is interviewing the media [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=1996.0s)]
*  without addressing the diseased and dying elephant in the room, the media. Scarborough [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2000.96s)]
*  was talking with the authors of a new book that details just how Biden really was, how [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2006.0800000000002s)]
*  bad he was. And Scarborough acts as if he knew it the whole time. But it wasn't that [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2009.88s)]
*  long ago when Scarborough said this about the commander in coma. He's cogent. But I [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2014.96s)]
*  undersold him when I said he was cogent. He's far beyond cogent. In fact, I think he's [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2021.3200000000002s)]
*  better than he's ever been intellectually, um, analytically. Cogent? I think he meant [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2027.72s)]
*  pungent. Keep yacking, you grifter. Start your tape right now because I'm about to tell [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2035.96s)]
*  you the truth and F you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2042.4s)]
*  analytically is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I've known him for years. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2052.96s)]
*  The Brzezinski's have known him for 50 years. If it weren't the truth, I wouldn't say it. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2059.4s)]
*  Of course it wasn't the truth, you bozo, which is why you said it. This guy has always been [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2064.68s)]
*  more full of s**t than a cage full of chimps mainlining Metamucil. Here he is in 2023 [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2070.7s)]
*  with the same line of caca del Toro about Biden's supernaturally keen focus. You know, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2077.7s)]
*  I bet he'll wake you up when you're asleep at 8 30 at night. He'll wake me up when I'm [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  asleep at 8 30 at night because Meek and I of course wake up at 4 30 in the morning and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2089.08s)]
*  I'll just go, hello? Yes, sir. Yeah. And about an hour later he would give you, he will [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2093.36s)]
*  aggressively and very effectively give me point by point by point about how my op-ed [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  was spot. First of all, what kind of loser has to get up at 4 30 in the morning? So he [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2107.34s)]
*  real relays an anecdote about Biden calling him up to talk politics. He left out the part [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2117.04s)]
*  that Biden thought he was talking to Amelia Earhart. But does anybody really believe that [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2122.56s)]
*  story seriously? Biden didn't have the mental capability to dissect his own pork chop for [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  dinner, let alone dissect a Joe Scarborough op-ed. He couldn't debate a speak and spell, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2134.08s)]
*  which is why they told him the speak and spell was the nuclear football. And Scarborough [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2140.2s)]
*  actually wanted us to believe Joe was still awake at 8 30 at night. By then he was already [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2145.12s)]
*  in his cryogenic chamber, dreaming about his uncle getting eaten by cannibals, overcoming [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2150.6s)]
*  oil cancer and corn pops love for hairy legs. Remember this stinky pile of crap from February [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2156.2s)]
*  2024 after special counsel Robert Herr declined to pursue criminal charges against Biden? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2165.0s)]
*  Herr said Biden willfully possessed classified docs, but it was okay because he's an old [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2170.4s)]
*  man with a bad memory. Well, the Dems exploded with rage at this obvious truth and this hack [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2174.7999999999997s)]
*  led the attack. There's so many people that immediately heard this, these random, random [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2180.24s)]
*  conclusions, irrelevant conclusions who first of all wondered why in the world he would [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2187.56s)]
*  put that in a report. His neurological assessment of Joe Biden, why in the world would, would [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2194.56s)]
*  the Justice Department allow that dicta to be in there? It's gratuitous. It's a very [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2202.9199999999996s)]
*  well and he knows it's gratuitous and it was bad faith. Of course it was also true. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2210.3199999999997s)]
*  Scarborough got within 200 feet of a polygraph machine. It would burst into flames, but Scarborough [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  couldn't afford to be honest with his audience because the Dems had a big bad orange man [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2222.6s)]
*  breathing down their necks. So he had to deny Biden's physical and mental decline, which [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2227.4799999999996s)]
*  the whole world saw every day. He had to blurt out hostile fidgety or they wouldn't give [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2232.3999999999996s)]
*  him the pills that keep him from turning into a werewolf. His entire grip was so that [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2237.32s)]
*  it could be the last person MSNBC lays off. I mean, it's not like his night job as a butt [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2241.6000000000004s)]
*  head impersonator would cover his monthly nut, but now in 2025 when he thinks it's safe, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2248.1200000000003s)]
*  Scarborough has seen the light. I remember talking to a reporter three days before the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2256.1600000000003s)]
*  primary, I mean before the debate and we were talking about how Biden was starting [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2263.16s)]
*  to fall behind in Minnesota, that Virginia was getting really tight, uncomfortably tight [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2268.08s)]
*  and Democrats were afraid Biden would even lose New Hampshire. We both said to each other, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2275.3199999999997s)]
*  the funny thing is like no matter how, no matter how Biden does in this debate, people [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2279.7999999999997s)]
*  are going to blame the debate for the way the polls are already breaking before the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2284.8399999999997s)]
*  debate. Wait, you mean the funny thing is that no matter how Biden does in the debate, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2291.0s)]
*  he's going to be blamed for the polls? No, the funny thing is if you had just told the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2295.48s)]
*  truth when it mattered, maybe the Dems would have had time to find a candidate who could [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2301.0s)]
*  actually win an election. Hell, Jimmy Carter was still around at that point. He would have [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2304.92s)]
*  done a better job at that debate, but he didn't. So now you have to lie about your lies. But [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2309.56s)]
*  it could always be worse. Morning Joe could be on a network, people watch. All right, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2317.04s)]
*  let's welcome tonight's guest. He gives fans something to remember. A terrible experience. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2322.04s)]
*  Writer and comedian Joe DeVito. Every time I pee, I think of his last name. Actor and [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2330.24s)]
*  comedian Steve Byrne. She's so hot she fogs her own glasses. Host of Kennedy's Aids to [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2338.08s)]
*  World Podcast, Kennedy. And he's the reason for Cathedral Ceilings New York Times special [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2345.64s)]
*  and other comedian and former NWA World Champion Tyrus. Joe, I don't have goals, but I'm going [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2352.88s)]
*  to make it my goal that we never forget what Joe Scarborough said. Anytime he says something, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2365.48s)]
*  I'm playing those videos over and over. Because how can he switch like this and expect everybody [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2371.2s)]
*  is as dumb as his wife? Yeah, well, she hired him. Unless his memory is worse than Joe Biden's, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2378.0s)]
*  he has to know. The way he said, oh, the shock at the debate. The only shock at the debate [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2388.52s)]
*  was when they hit Biden with the defibrillators before they threw him out in front. Everything [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2393.0s)]
*  he said is now it's incomprehensible that this is the best version. What is the worst [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2399.56s)]
*  version of Joe Biden look like? Is it just a stain on a carpet or a head floating in [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  a jar? It was all in the anger with which he said it made it incredible. Joe Biden was [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2411.44s)]
*  not calling anyone at 8.30. He's not calling anyone at 8.30 a.m. All of his calls went [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2417.88s)]
*  forwarded directly to 911. Even the visiting angels turned off their phones. They sent [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2424.48s)]
*  him a voicemail. I feel bad in a way for some Democrats. I don't feel bad for us because [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2432.48s)]
*  we called this right from the beginning. We knew it was ridiculous. We knew Joe Biden [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2438.8399999999997s)]
*  was rotting and declining. This sudden decline. Mount Everest doesn't have a sudden decline [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2442.44s)]
*  as this sharp. We knew it was garbage, but I feel bad for the people who watch that and [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2448.24s)]
*  now have to say, oh, did we do the same thing he did where we had to we had to deny what [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2453.08s)]
*  our eyes and ears were telling us because we didn't want to believe it. And they have [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2458.56s)]
*  to live with that. We can gloat. Yeah. You know, Steve, you're watching this and you're [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2462.6s)]
*  watching the media interview, the media and neither of them admits that they were the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2467.08s)]
*  problem, that they did the cover up. No. Well, first off, look, speaking of the media, I [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2471.12s)]
*  just want to say it's a pleasure to be here. It's so great to see you guys and you guys. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2474.84s)]

*  his show. And it's like I found out I realized, oh, I'm on Gutfeld before his show because [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2491.48s)]
*  I'm not black enough. You know, the three hosts are black. The three hosts are black. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2495.84s)]
*  Roy's black. The co-host, Amber Ruffins is black. Even the white guy's named Michael [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2500.1600000000003s)]
*  Ian Black. Now, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2504.2400000000002s)]
*  But even when my wife and I were watching the debate and when Biden came walking out, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2507.08s)]
*  when he was walking, I was like, oh, God. And every time that guy walks, you ever see [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2517.24s)]
*  Star Wars, the Phantom Menace when C-3PO's not fully fixed, that he's kind of like met [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2521.3199999999997s)]
*  on the wire, he's kind of walking. But even that farewell speech, I watched his farewell [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2525.3199999999997s)]
*  speech and I was like, this speech is sad, it's kind of morose, but what I like best [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2530.48s)]
*  about his farewell speech was his open casket. Yes. It's true. Too much heat. Too much heat. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2536.52s)]
*  I've never had a guest stand up all the time. You get merch. You guys get merch. Do I beat [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2547.92s)]

*  to figure that Morning Joe has got to be a weird place to work right now. Because not [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  only were they humiliated. Are you asking me for intel? Because I've got it. Go ahead. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2574.4s)]
*  No, tell me. You know she does that research thing. Continue with your question. I was [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2578.12s)]

*  a miserable place to work. There is more tension among the hosts than is reported. They are [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2591.7200000000003s)]
*  so the wrong side of the executives, especially the new president who was interim president [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2602.36s)]

*  turbocharged ass-kissing machine just to keep their jobs. Because like Joy Reid, they enjoyed [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2614.6s)]
*  a precipitous decline in their ratings the day after the election because they lied. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2621.8s)]
*  They tried to ease their viewers' fears. They parroted Kamala's horrible comms tea. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2629.04s)]
*  The internal polling, which was completely skewed. I don't know who they were lying [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2637.0s)]
*  to. Were they lying to keep their jobs? Were they lying to make Kamala feel better so she [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2642.64s)]
*  didn't completely implode on the campaign trail? Were they lying to Joe and Mika so [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2646.8s)]
*  they could have a constant propaganda factory? But it is a miracle with their lack of objectivity [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2652.08s)]
*  that they are still employed. Yes, but also Tyrus, it is about pride. Everything, all [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2659.4s)]
*  they were wrong on everything but they can't admit it because it would destroy themselves. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2667.16s)]
*  They're too proudful, is that a word? Prideful. Prideful to admit they were wrong. Proudful. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2672.28s)]
*  I felt proudful. I think we all got it. Yeah, prideful. Can I say this? I'm a member of [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2681.12s)]
*  the Proudful Boys. I think a couple things. First of all, I think that the people who [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2688.92s)]
*  are in the show, first of all he should change the name of the show to Morning Wood. Because [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2697.0s)]

*  No one takes calls or calls him to discuss anything. And he lies so bad that he gets [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2709.44s)]
*  lost in his lies. Because when you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2715.08s)]
*  When you lie you have a lot to remember. And he's not good at remembering, which is weird [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2718.72s)]
*  to me because based on the size of his forehead he should be able to tell what I'm thinking. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2722.84s)]
*  How the hell do you have a receding hairline and a hair piece? Get it together, bro. And [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2726.7200000000003s)]

*  like, hey, hey, Joe, maybe don't help us so much. Because he was like, I just got off [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2741.84s)]
*  the phone with him and he's sharper than he's ever been. And they're like, whoa, we're not [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2744.96s)]
*  willing to go that far. He's the president and he didn't even allow to be around sharp [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2747.7200000000003s)]

*  get speaking events, we're going to get this, we're going to get exclusive interviews, we're [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2756.32s)]
*  going to make a lot of money. So you can't even give them the respectful thing of like, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2759.48s)]
*  no, it was about trying to see it through. No, they thought they could cash money. And [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2764.76s)]
*  then there was no money. So what did they do? They slid over to Mar-a-Largo to try to [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2768.28s)]
*  see like, hey, if you could throw us some interviews, we'd be on your team. And the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSnN2kH_xig&t=2773.52s)]
