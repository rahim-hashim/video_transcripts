# Fox News Highlights -  Nov. 6, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU)
*  Ingram, this is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2.5s)]
*  We have a huge show for you tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=4.4s)]
*  Eric Trump is here, along with the House Speaker, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=5.8s)]
*  Mike Johnson, Senator-elect Bernie Moreno, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=7.98s)]
*  and Charlie Kirk. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=10.68s)]
*  But first, the Trump triumph. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=12.38s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=15.24s)]
*  All right, if you're like me, these past nine years [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=19.18s)]
*  have been a total blur, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=21.44s)]
*  because from the day that Donald Trump came down, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=23.68s)]
*  that golden escalator back in 2015, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=26.0s)]
*  right up until yesterday afternoon, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=28.4s)]
*  the elites countered him out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=30.24s)]
*  This is not an actual campaign. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=33.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=34.28s)]
*  This is a high school play about a campaign. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  This is a bad high school play. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=37.0s)]
*  This is like a bad set of props [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=38.08s)]
*  that no one's gonna look too closely at. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=39.94s)]
*  The Russians offered help. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=41.5s)]
*  The campaign accepted help. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=42.78s)]
*  That is pretty damning, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=44.339999999999996s)]
*  whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=45.94s)]
*  of conspiracy or not. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=47.84s)]
*  Trump has faced setbacks in court, dismal polls. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=49.44s)]
*  It's been an unmitigated disaster. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=53.08s)]
*  I think he's more unhinged, more unstable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=55.24s)]
*  I think you see that all the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=60.04s)]
*  But, you know, they weren't content [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=64.72s)]
*  to beat Donald Trump in a fair election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=66.92s)]
*  They needed their insurance policies [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=69.14s)]
*  with corrupt prosecutions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  And in this maniacal mission, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=73.44s)]
*  they abused our government institutions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=75.14s)]
*  They destroyed the credibility of the FBI, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  the DOJ, state DA offices, the House of Representatives, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  even the NIH. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  How venal and how selfish they all were. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=85.66s)]
*  But last night's stunning victory, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=89.16s)]
*  it wasn't just a personal triumph [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=90.9s)]
*  for President Trump and his family, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=92.4s)]
*  who've all gone through hell, by the way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=94.12s)]
*  It was a complete and a total political vindication [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=96.2s)]
*  of his first term record and of his current agenda. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=99.62s)]
*  So it turns out that you can't allow a migrant invasion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=103.56s)]
*  You can't drive up inflation, food and gas prices, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=107.56s)]
*  and blow $200 billion in Ukraine [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=110.64s)]
*  and expect to win the presidency. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=113.5s)]
*  Democrat strategists knew that both Kamala's record [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  and her personality, really, they weren't very popular. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=120.64s)]
*  And she was pretty untalented on the trail, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=123.8s)]
*  which is why they rarely put her out there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  to defend her record. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=129.0s)]
*  Now, last night, I heard a lot of people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=131.0s)]
*  still talking about Trump's rhetoric, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=132.56s)]
*  and rhetoric's a problem, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=134.44s)]
*  completely ignoring the fact [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=135.9s)]
*  that Democrats spent weeks calling him Hitler [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=137.16s)]
*  and a fascist. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=140.06s)]
*  So that was a colossal mistake. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=141.82s)]
*  It only revealed the desperation and vacuousness [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=143.36s)]
*  of the Democrats and Kamala Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=146.96s)]
*  Now, no one believed that Trump was Hitler or fascist. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=149.66s)]
*  No one believed the smears, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=152.26s)]
*  not even the Democrats who made them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=153.32s)]
*  So in the end, this campaign wasn't about personality. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't about race. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=158.66s)]
*  It wasn't about abortion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=159.62s)]
*  Instead, Trump and his absolutely brilliant team [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=161.2s)]
*  made this election about the issues [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=165.02s)]
*  that mattered most to regular Americans, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=166.82s)]
*  the economy, and the border, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=169.02s)]
*  with just the right emphasis on trans radicalism [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=170.78s)]
*  and endless wars. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=173.78s)]
*  So the coalition of the forgotten men and women [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=176.08s)]
*  who turned out for Trump in 2016, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  it grew to include young voters and minorities, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=181.22s)]
*  and the numbers and the reasons why were breathtaking. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=185.62s)]
*  I was talking to, texting with, an elected in Pennsylvania, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  and he said he was talking to a prison guard [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  about why he's voting for Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=197.58s)]
*  And he said, as clear as day to me, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=199.34s)]
*  Democrats make me feel bad about who I am. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=201.84s)]
*  Now, more Americans, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  groups that Republicans never bothered to court, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=208.74s)]
*  said no to the status quo of decline and despair. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=211.34s)]
*  And they said yes to the Trump agenda [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=214.68s)]
*  of peace and prosperity. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=216.68s)]
*  That sounded great to them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  And they saw Trump stand and fight for them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  And so last night in an early voting, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=223.68s)]
*  they turned out in record numbers to stand for him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=225.48s)]
*  I wanna thank the American people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=228.84s)]
*  for the extraordinary honor of being elected, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=230.78s)]
*  your 47th president and your 45th president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=233.98s)]
*  And every citizen, I will fight for you, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=238.98s)]
*  for your family and your future. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=241.22s)]
*  Every single day, I will be fighting for you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  And with every breath in my body, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=247.32s)]
*  I will not rest until we have delivered [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=251.72s)]
*  the strong, safe and prosperous America [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=253.88s)]
*  that our children deserve and that you deserve. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=256.24s)]
*  This will truly be the golden age of America. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=260.14s)]
*  So at its core, Trump's message, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  it has always been optimistic. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=267.82s)]
*  He loves this country. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=270.34s)]
*  He loves the blue cities, the red cities, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=271.98s)]
*  rural and small town America, all of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=273.98s)]
*  And he gets angry for the same reasons we all get angry [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=276.82s)]
*  when we see Americans who are shortchanged [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=279.54s)]
*  by incompetent leadership and by politicians [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=282.78s)]
*  who sell out the interests of the people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=285.61999999999995s)]
*  to the highest bidder or just a radical activist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=288.02s)]
*  So with a committed team of patriots and all of you, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=291.32s)]
*  he pledges to return America to Americans. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=294.78s)]
*  I will govern by a simple motto, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=298.78s)]
*  promises made, promises kept. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  We're gonna keep our promises. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  Nothing will stop me from keeping my word to you, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  to the people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=309.98s)]
*  We will make America safe, strong, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=310.82s)]
*  prosperous, powerful and free again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=313.62s)]
*  Trump's message last night was just powerful. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=317.22s)]
*  And it was powerful because it was straightforward. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=319.88s)]
*  And yes, even for Trump, it was humble. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=322.26s)]
*  So Democrats claim, and they have claimed, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=325.76s)]
*  oh, they want unity. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=327.62s)]
*  Oh, we all need to be unified and nice to each other. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=328.68s)]
*  So they should have appreciated Trump's victory speech. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  It's time to put the divisions of the past four years [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=334.88s)]
*  behind us. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=339.26s)]
*  It's time to unite. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=340.14s)]
*  The success is going to bring us together [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=341.56s)]
*  and we are going to start by all putting America first. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  We have to put our country first [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=349.7s)]
*  for at least a period of time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=351.2s)]
*  We have to fix it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=352.84s)]
*  Because together we can truly make America great again [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  for all Americans. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=358.3s)]
*  For all of America, even if you didn't vote for him, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=360.14s)]
*  and who doesn't want America to be great again? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  I never understood the opposition to that idea. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  The left wants us to downsize our dreams [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=368.8s)]
*  and the globalists want us to do as we're told, just shut up. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  So Harris was simply a figurehead of failure [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=375.74s)]
*  installed by party bigwigs who called all the shots. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=378.56s)]
*  She reads what they tell her to read. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=382.64s)]
*  And a few hours ago, Kamala Harris read a concession speech [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=385.8s)]
*  that was really a resistance speech [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=389.9s)]
*  and embarrassed herself once again. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  A fundamental principle of American democracy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  That principle, as much as any other, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=411.18s)]
*  At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  not to a president or a party, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  but to the Constitution of the United States. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=426.34s)]
*  Wait a second, is Kamala Harris [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  actually defending the Constitution? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=432.38s)]
*  That's a first. Of course, this is coming from a VP [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=433.82s)]
*  whose administration's policies [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=436.08s)]
*  have been repeatedly struck down by the Supreme Court. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=437.88s)]
*  So, so far, Democrats, I don't think they really are getting [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=441.94s)]
*  why they lost, maybe take some time to process. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  They lost because the country was worse off [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=449.82s)]
*  than it was four years ago, in every respect. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=451.73999999999995s)]
*  And voters saw through the phony joy pitch. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=454.78s)]
*  That was easy to do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=457.38s)]
*  So today, Kamala didn't talk about fascism, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=459.24s)]
*  but she did drop another F-bomb. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=461.88s)]
*  While I concede this election, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=464.38s)]
*  I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=467.52s)]
*  That is a fight I will never give up. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=472.62s)]
*  We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=475.72s)]
*  in the courts, and in the public square. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=480.58s)]
*  Sometimes the fight takes a while. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=484.02s)]
*  That doesn't mean we won't win. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean we won't win. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=489.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, that won't work. 21 years ago, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=493.14s)]
*  can't believe I'm saying that, 21 years ago, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=496.68s)]
*  I wrote a book about the elites in politics [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=499.12s)]
*  in Hollywood called Shut Up and Sing. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=501.18s)]
*  The introduction read like this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=503.62s)]
*  They think we're stupid. They think our patriotism is stupid. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=506.08s)]
*  They think our church-going is stupid. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=509.38s)]
*  They think having more than two children is stupid. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=511.34s)]
*  They've outgrown America. They're ashamed of her and us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=514.74s)]
*  We embarrass them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=519.42s)]
*  Now, since I wrote those words, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  the elites have only grown nastier, meaner, and more bitter. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=523.04s)]
*  But Trump, he never stopped speaking for the deplorables, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=527.62s)]
*  the irredeemables, and for Americans who've been ripped off, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=531.62s)]
*  stepped on, and disrespected for decades [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=535.54s)]
*  by an out-of-touch, condescending coterie of elites. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=538.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, last night, those elites and their media hacks [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=542.66s)]
*  and the legal assassins and the celebrity set, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=546.36s)]
*  the wokesters, all had their comeuppance. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  So tonight, I say bravo, Donald Trump. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=552.76s)]
*  No one else could have pulled this off. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=555.9s)]
*  And now the hard work begins, and that's the angle. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=558.5s)]
*  Fox News alert, the greatest comeback [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=562.0999999999999s)]
*  in American political history. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=564.3s)]
*  Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris in a landslide. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=566.2s)]
*  Axios is calling him one of the most transcendent [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=569.84s)]
*  political figures of our time. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=572.84s)]
*  After surviving two impeachments, two assassins, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=575.24s)]
*  and 94 felony indictments, he did it because you did it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=577.98s)]
*  The machine lost, and the Obama-Biden dynasty [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=582.98s)]
*  went down with it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=585.88s)]
*  The Republican Party in the United States of America [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=587.44s)]
*  will never be the same. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=589.94s)]
*  This is the biggest red wave I've seen [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=592.74s)]
*  since Ronald Reagan's 49-state victory in 1984. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=594.6s)]
*  This was a sweeping victory. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=600.44s)]
*  He is a seismic force in American history. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=603.1s)]
*  I like to see how bad the shellacking is. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=606.94s)]
*  This is a shellacking for the Democrats tonight. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=608.84s)]
*  Trump's on track to win 312 electoral votes, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=612.08s)]
*  as we believe Arizona and Nevada will move red [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=615.24s)]
*  after their counts. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=617.64s)]
*  Liberals woke up this morning confused. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=619.34s)]
*  How could a dictator win the popular vote? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  And take the Senate, and probably the House? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=624.38s)]
*  The answer's simple. They lied to you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=627.44s)]
*  But Trump listened to you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=630.4200000000001s)]
*  They told you the border was secure, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=632.7800000000001s)]
*  the economy was humming, and Joe Biden was an Olympic athlete, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=634.34s)]
*  even though he couldn't stop falling down [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=638.0400000000001s)]
*  and forgetting his own name. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=639.58s)]
*  If you had a problem with that, they censored you. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=641.48s)]
*  And when they started losing, they called you fascist garbage [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=644.38s)]
*  who just needed a smack in the ass. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=648.08s)]
*  The last four years, we witnessed the Democrats go crazy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  They loaded illegals into airplanes and flew them here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=655.2199999999999s)]
*  They emptied jails, made up genders, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=658.92s)]
*  handed out free sex changes, and printed money like Zimbabwe. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=661.92s)]
*  We all watched it happen. We didn't like it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=665.78s)]
*  Trump listened, said, I hear you, I get it, I'll fix it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=668.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not that complicated. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  We kept the faith in the face of last-minute hoaxes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=674.28s)]
*  Remember, Kamala was going to win Iowa. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=677.98s)]
*  A comedian made a joke about Puerto Rico. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=680.88s)]
*  Oh, my God, it's over. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=682.98s)]
*  Trump's tariffs are going to wreck the economy. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=684.98s)]
*  Really? Because the market today had its best day in two years. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump did better with Puerto Ricans [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=692.52s)]
*  and beat her by 13 in Iowa. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=694.88s)]
*  The American people don't like being lied to. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=698.12s)]
*  Trump even did better with women than Kamala did with men. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=701.02s)]
*  Imagine that. Wives didn't have to lie to their husbands. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=704.66s)]
*  The so-called racist dictator shattered records [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=708.76s)]
*  with blacks, Hispanics, Jews, and college students. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=711.46s)]
*  His margin in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=715.08s)]
*  where they're definitely not eating the pets, went up. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=717.16s)]
*  Trump, Mr. Muslim ban, won Muslims in Dearborn, Michigan. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=720.82s)]
*  The guy who they said hated Hispanics won Miami-Dade County. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the first time a Republican pulled that off [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=729.76s)]
*  since Reagan. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=731.76s)]
*  And the funniest part of the election, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=733.52s)]
*  and we've had some moments, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=735.48s)]
*  was that Biden would have done better than Harris [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=737.28s)]
*  if he hadn't gotten whacked. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=740.4599999999999s)]
*  So you asked, are there any places [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=742.62s)]
*  that the vice president is overperforming Joe Biden in 2020? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=744.0799999999999s)]

*  I think that's a takeaway from this race. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=908.88s)]
*  Abortion was supposed to make this the battle of the sexes. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=911.38s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=914.84s)]

*  and whatever they looked like. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=924.34s)]
*  That's the sweet spot of American political power. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=926.38s)]
*  And the Democrats derided and deserted them, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=929.72s)]
*  even though they're outnumbered by them. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=932.22s)]
*  What a stupid strategy. You can't win over America [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=934.44s)]
*  if you hate Americans. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=937.92s)]

*  I can tell you in conversations we've had [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=964.26s)]
*  with a series of individuals, including a Democrat [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=966.4s)]

*  of the United States of America [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1175.8s)]
*  after a resounding and historic win. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1178.06s)]
*  Now, when all the votes are counted, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1181.1s)]
*  well, this will be an electoral landslide [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1183.04s)]
*  in every way imaginable. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1186.06s)]
*  Donald Trump will also be the first Republican [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1187.8s)]
*  to win the popular vote since 2004. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1190.84s)]
*  Republicans also won control of the U.S. Senate [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1193.94s)]
*  big time last night, and the GOP is favored [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1196.48s)]
*  to keep the majority in the House [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1199.2s)]
*  by a bigger margin than originally projected. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1200.88s)]
*  But the good news doesn't stop there. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1204.48s)]
*  According to an ABC News poll, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1206.7s)]
*  ABC News, all federal charges against Donald Trump [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1210.18s)]
*  brought by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris' weaponized DOJ [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1213.9s)]
*  are expected to be phased out. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1219.04s)]
*  In other words, lawfare, hopefully, will come to an end. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1221.7s)]
*  The New York Post is calling Trump [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1225.5s)]
*  the comeback king of American politics. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1227.4s)]
*  And by the way, here's what Dave Portnoy [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1229.94s)]
*  of Barstool had to say, take a look. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1231.84s)]
*  A lot of people are asking, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1234.6s)]
*  like, how did Trump get more votes than he got last time? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1235.44s)]
*  Well, here's the answer. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1237.86s)]
*  Because people like myself, independents or moderates, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1239.16s)]
*  the Democrats gave us no choice. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1243.3s)]
*  All right, Dave, we'll join us in a few minutes, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1246.66s)]
*  and we'll also, of course, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1248.96s)]
*  we must get an update on Miss Peaches. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1250.5s)]
*  Anyway, the most famous dog in the world. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1253.26s)]
*  But first tonight, to be honest, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1254.8s)]
*  I'm not gonna spike the football tonight. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1257.56s)]
*  We wish Kamala, all her supporters, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  well, in spite of how horribly, despicably, repulsively [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1261.5s)]
*  they have treated many of us, President Trump, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1266.8999999999999s)]
*  we're not garbage, we're not Nazis, we're not fascists. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1269.84s)]
*  And in fact, in many ways, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1273.26s)]
*  this is a good day for all Americans, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1275.56s)]
*  even those that maybe supported the Harris campaign. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1277.46s)]
*  Despite some fear mongering on the left, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1280.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is not going to rule as a dictator. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1282.66s)]
*  Remember, he was president for four years. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1285.8000000000002s)]
*  He will not be imprisoning his political opponents [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1287.76s)]
*  or take his haters off the airways. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1291.5s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, the conspiracy theorist, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  will spread her lies and misinformation in perpetuity. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1297.0s)]
*  Trump's second term will not be about retribution. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1300.76s)]
*  Frankly, there is too much work [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1303.4s)]
*  to be done to fix this country. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's the bottom line. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1306.96s)]
*  Isn't that what elections are really all about? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1308.2s)]
*  So despite the incessant lying [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1310.32s)]
*  of the radical extreme left in this country, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  the president-elect, Donald Trump, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1315.52s)]
*  will work tirelessly within the bounds of the Constitution [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  to make America great again, safer, free, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1320.98s)]
*  or more prosperous, and a better place for all Americans. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1324.22s)]
*  That's his mandate. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1327.56s)]
*  No more lawfare, no more censorship, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1328.78s)]
*  lower taxes, lower interest rates, a secure border, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1331.52s)]

*  better trade policies, free and fair trade, safer streets, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1338.9199999999998s)]
*  no more woke madness and insanity, fewer regulations, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1343.2199999999998s)]
*  lower prices at the grocery store and at gas stations. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1347.4599999999998s)]
*  This is what you, all of you, the American people, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1351.6s)]
*  voted for, and this is what Donald Trump ran on [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1355.26s)]
*  and will try to deliver on, and I have every confidence [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1358.52s)]
*  he will deliver. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1362.12s)]

*  Now, of course, it's not gonna be easy. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1364.56s)]
*  Nothing really has ever been easy for Donald Trump, has it? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1367.1s)]
*  The hoaxes, the lies, the misinformation, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1370.26s)]
*  conspiracy theories, the witch hunts, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1372.74s)]
*  the bogus impeachments, lawsuits, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1374.54s)]
*  nonstop, reckless, hatred, hysteria [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1376.9599999999998s)]

*  CNN, Kamala's underperformance all over the country, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1490.44s)]
*  it just, well, frankly, took him by surprise. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1495.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1497.98s)]
*  So you asked, are there any places [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1499.08s)]
*  that the vice president is overperforming Joe Biden [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1500.64s)]
*  in 2020? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1503.04s)]
*  So we can show you that as well. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1503.64s)]
*  We just bring that out here. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1504.78s)]
*  Harris overperforming 2020. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1506.1s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1507.94s)]
*  There you go. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1508.74s)]
*  So let this go away and see if there's anything [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1509.54s)]
*  on the East Side there. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1511.54s)]
*  Literally nothing? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1513.2s)]
*  Literally nothing. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1514.44s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1517.34s)]
*  There was a massive shift in every state. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1518.6399999999999s)]
*  Even deep blue New Jersey. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1520.94s)]
*  New Jersey was within five points, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1522.78s)]
*  Illinois around eight points. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  But Democratic leaders, this should serve as a wake-up call. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1526.58s)]
*  America is sick and tired of your failed policies, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  of your rigid woke-ism. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1534.8s)]
*  But sadly, many in the media mob, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1537.36s)]
*  they just can't see the writing on the wall. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1539.46s)]
*  According to certain left-wing hosts, racist, sexist, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1541.5s)]
*  were to blame for last night's results. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1544.86s)]
*  That's what happened last night. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1547.06s)]
*  Racism and sexism. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1548.34s)]
*  No. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1550.6599999999999s)]
*  But take a look anyway. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1551.24s)]
*  Democrats need to be mature, and they need to be honest. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1553.0s)]
*  And they need to say, yes, there is misogyny. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1557.1399999999999s)]
*  But it's not just misogyny from white men. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1561.6s)]
*  It's misogyny from Hispanic men. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1564.7s)]
*  It's misogyny from black men, things [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1567.54s)]
*  we've all been talking about, who do not [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1569.64s)]
*  want a woman leading them. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1571.8s)]
*  Black voters came through for Kamala Harris. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1573.4s)]
*  White women voters did not. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1576.2s)]
*  That is what it appears happened in that state. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1578.8400000000001s)]
*  This will be the second opportunity [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  that white women in this country have to change the way [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1583.64s)]
*  that they interact with the patriarchy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1586.66s)]
*  She is a person of color. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1588.6000000000001s)]
*  She is a she. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1590.8s)]
*  And she is in an interracial marriage. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1592.24s)]
*  And I wonder, I have this question mark in my mind [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1594.56s)]
*  over whether all of those things combined [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1598.4199999999998s)]
*  was too much for pockets of this country. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1601.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's be honest about this. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1604.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's be absolutely blunt about it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1606.1s)]
*  There were appeals to racism in this campaign. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1608.76s)]
*  And there is racial bias in this country. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1612.02s)]
*  And there is sexism in this country. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1614.22s)]
*  And anybody who thinks that that did not in any way impact [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1616.4199999999998s)]
*  on the outcome of this race is wrong. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1620.1599999999999s)]
*  Remember that whole narrative got started by Barack Obama, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1623.28s)]
*  the brothers, and misogyny, and they don't want a woman. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1626.42s)]
*  And then Stacey Abrams follows it up with, yeah, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1630.3600000000001s)]
*  African-American men, there's racism and there's sexism. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1634.3600000000001s)]
*  Look, the Trump haters, I get it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1638.1200000000001s)]
*  You're not in a good place right now. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1640.28s)]
*  We'll give you a little bit of latitude. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1641.92s)]
*  Some on the left even melting down on social media. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1644.3600000000001s)]
*  Some of it is actually quite hilarious [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1648.08s)]
*  after the Empire State building lit up red [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1650.32s)]
*  to commemorate Donald Trump's win. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1654.72s)]
*  And meanwhile, comedian, listen to this, Jerry Seinfeld, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1656.6599999999999s)]
*  called out his kids' old school. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1662.32s)]
*  They're giving, you can't even make it up, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1663.22s)]
*  distressed students, they're distressed [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1666.4199999999998s)]
*  over the election results. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1669.6599999999999s)]
*  The day off, after the election, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1671.56s)]
*  forget about the land of the free, the home of the brave. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1675.12s)]
*  We're now the home of what, liberal snowflakes? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1678.52s)]
*  You know, one left-wing group is now even sending out texts. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1681.56s)]
*  I got this from a friend of mine. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1685.06s)]
*  I just got this text encouraging Democrats [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1686.28s)]
*  to grieve with loved ones and then take to the streets. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1689.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1694.12s)]
*  My message to those deeply upset on the left, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1695.3799999999999s)]
*  it's gonna be okay. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1698.72s)]
*  Just keep watching the show. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1699.76s)]
*  We will handitize you. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1701.28s)]
*  We'll get your mind straight. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1702.68s)]
*  But to quote the Rolling Stones, listen, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1704.58s)]
*  we've been on the air after elections [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1708.12s)]
*  that didn't go the way I wanted them to go. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1710.3s)]
*  And you know what, we all survive. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1712.32s)]
*  You don't always get what you want, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1714.22s)]
*  but if you try sometimes, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1716.76s)]
*  you might just find you get what you need. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1718.62s)]
*  And America, frankly, needs Donald Trump [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1721.26s)]
*  after four years of nothing but disastrous policies [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1723.56s)]
*  of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1726.96s)]
*  This country's bloated, all-powerful, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1729.12s)]
*  bureaucracy's gotta be held in check. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1731.52s)]
*  Meritocracy, the foundation, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  the greatest system of wealth creation [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1736.72s)]
*  ever designed by man. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1739.6200000000001s)]
*  It is called capitalism, not the Green New Deal. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  It must return to every industry in our country. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1744.18s)]
*  Our borders must be secure. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1747.98s)]
*  We're allowing in people that are committing murder [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1750.78s)]
*  and rape and violent crimes, cartels, drug dealers, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1753.06s)]
*  I mean, gang members. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1757.32s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1758.52s)]
*  Iranian hit squads are in our country [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1759.78s)]
*  and 12 and a half million, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1763.46s)]
*  we're gonna give them what, free sex change operations, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1764.96s)]
*  free homes, free college education, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  and then amnesty, this is madness. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1769.8s)]
*  Our laws at our border must be enforced. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1772.72s)]
*  The American dream has got to be restored. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1776.1000000000001s)]
*  And unlike what the Washington Post is saying, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1779.76s)]
*  don't settle for a townhouse [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1782.7s)]
*  if you want a house or the backyard. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1784.2s)]
*  We shouldn't have to settle. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1786.56s)]
*  We shouldn't have to put our sweaters on [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1787.66s)]
*  and lower the heat in our house. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a tall order. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1793.2s)]
*  But no one will fight for you like Donald Trump. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1794.62s)]
*  You know what? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1797.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a good side to a president [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1798.52s)]
*  that fights for his country. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1799.6599999999999s)]
*  So it's true Kamala Harris got shellacked [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  like a hardwood floor on this old house. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1803.02s)]
*  And instead of an evening concession speech, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1807.26s)]
*  she avoided her supporters [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1809.58s)]
*  like Hunter Biden dodging child support. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1810.9199999999998s)]
*  For the first time, she wasn't laughing. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1814.62s)]
*  Although you got to admit, this is pretty hilarious. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1817.06s)]
*  Watch. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1819.8799999999999s)]
*  Are there any places where Kamala Harris [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1821.4599999999998s)]

*  So we can show you that as well. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1826.22s)]
*  We just bring that out here. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1827.36s)]
*  Harris overperforming 2020. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1828.68s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1830.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1831.32s)]
*  So let this go away and see if there's anything [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1832.16s)]
*  on the east side there. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1834.12s)]
*  Literally nothing? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1835.82s)]
*  Literally nothing. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1837.02s)]
*  Literally not one counting? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1837.86s)]
*  By 3% or more. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1839.26s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1840.62s)]
*  I can't believe he did it that way. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1842.42s)]
*  This is called a mandate. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1843.82s)]
*  He won the popular vote by over five million. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1846.08s)]
*  That can't be explained away. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1848.26s)]
*  The Dems can't give their usual excuses [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1849.82s)]
*  with more butt, butt, butts [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1852.24s)]
*  than a Kardashian family reunion. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1853.68s)]
*  And so there will be changes. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1858.44s)]
*  Shoplifters may actually have to pay for stuff. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1859.88s)]
*  Migrant gangs might have to get a new realtor. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1862.14s)]
*  And Jimmy Kimmel will probably be institutionalized. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1866.14s)]
*  But there's a larger question. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1870.6200000000001s)]
*  Did Trump do this by the strength of his personality alone [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1872.04s)]
*  or has America changed [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1876.02s)]
*  and Trump's just the first to call it like it is? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1877.68s)]
*  I mean, he did that with the media [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1880.68s)]
*  and the same collection of hacks [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1881.98s)]
*  who told us fairy tales about how close [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1883.44s)]
*  this was all gonna be [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1886.04s)]
*  and how abortion would send the evil orange man packing [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1887.34s)]
*  and how the polls were gonna be honest this time. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1890.08s)]
*  Turns out they had the accuracy [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1893.08s)]
*  of Stevie Wonder playing Jenga. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1894.48s)]
*  Truth is... [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1897.04s)]
*  So cheap. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1898.14s)]
*  The truth is Musk and Joe Rogan and a few other podcasts [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1905.88s)]
*  did more to get the word out on this election [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1909.54s)]
*  than all the legacy media combined. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1911.52s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1913.68s)]
*  Tells you one thing, legacy media is dead. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1914.82s)]
*  It is. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1920.68s)]
*  I only hope, I only hope that if Brian Stelter [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1921.68s)]
*  jumps from a window, it's from the first floor [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  so we won't crush dozens of pedestrians. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1927.18s)]
*  But there's another group that's over too. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1931.48s)]
*  It's Hollywood, all the virtue signaling [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1933.12s)]
*  from the Anisons and the Clooney's. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1935.48s)]
*  It didn't mean a thing. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1938.22s)]
*  All that Botox must have paralyzed their brains [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1939.42s)]
*  into believing it matters what they think. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1942.22s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1944.78s)]
*  Sorry douchebags, you're just hairless circus bears [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1949.88s)]
*  here to entertain us. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1953.5800000000002s)]
*  The other message, identity politics is dead. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1955.98s)]
*  D-E-I-D-O-A. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1958.98s)]
*  Enough with... [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1960.8200000000002s)]
*  Enough with dividing Americans into absurd categories [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1965.88s)]
*  that only matter to self-obsessed people [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1969.12s)]
*  with more pronouns than friends. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1971.12s)]
*  The truth is Americans of all stripes [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  want the same things, prosperity, safety, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1975.3799999999999s)]
*  a president who doesn't smell like an outhouse. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1978.78s)]
*  It's why Trump won record numbers of Hispanics [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1983.52s)]
*  and black voters, but he also won [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1986.12s)]
*  a whole bunch of different people. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1988.4799999999998s)]
*  What else could appeal to both black men and homage voters? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1990.4799999999998s)]
*  Well that list is Trump and common sense and fat asses. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1994.62s)]
*  Now Trump didn't do this alone. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=1999.12s)]
*  Talk about unsung heroes. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2001.12s)]
*  Scott Pressler drove his jalopy into the ground [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2002.8799999999999s)]
*  getting out the vote to flip Pennsylvania. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2005.1799999999998s)]
*  That's right, a gay man who helped convince the Amish [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2007.58s)]
*  to put down their butter churners [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2010.58s)]
*  and get to the polls and vote for Trump. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2012.4799999999998s)]
*  That's a movie Hollywood should make, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2014.9799999999998s)]
*  but they won't. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2017.9799999999998s)]
*  They won't. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2019.82s)]
*  They won't. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2020.82s)]
*  They won't. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2021.82s)]

*  They won't. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2025.82s)]
*  They won't. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2026.82s)]
*  JD Vance, who Russ Belter's recognized as one of their own. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2028.82s)]
*  Barron Trump, all 8 feet 11 inches of him, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2032.82s)]
*  who advised his dad on podcasts. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2035.82s)]
*  And of course, Muskin Rogan, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2038.32s)]
*  whose dedication to the free exchange of ideas [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2039.82s)]
*  scares the hell out of liars who only talk in soundbites. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2041.82s)]
*  And don't forget, Peanut the Squirrel, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2045.32s)]
*  who did not die in vain. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2048.8199999999997s)]
*  But perhaps the biggest, oh thank you, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2052.8199999999997s)]
*  but perhaps the biggest unsung hero, Kamala Harris. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2054.82s)]
*  She was Trump's secret weapon, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2058.82s)]
*  proving that you cannot win by identity alone. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2060.82s)]
*  You need ideas, a vision of a better life, brains. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2063.82s)]
*  You can't just tell us how deplorable we are, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2067.82s)]
*  laugh like a lunatic, and then rush home [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2070.32s)]
*  to make sure Doug's not tapping the nanny again [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2072.32s)]
*  like a keg of Bud Light. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2074.82s)]
*  Because whether you like Trump's policies or not, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2079.82s)]
*  at least he had some. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2082.32s)]
*  So will the media learn anything from this? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2084.32s)]
*  Will the Dems? Of course not. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2086.32s)]
*  Expect to be told how sexist and racist you are [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2088.32s)]
*  for the next four years. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2090.82s)]
*  But it won't work, because by now our collective skin [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2092.32s)]
*  is tougher than a $2 stake. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2094.32s)]
*  After all, the opposition called Trump a fascist and a Nazi. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2097.32s)]
*  They shot him. They told us he was a threat to democracy. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2100.32s)]
*  The coastal elite in the Obamas, Clintons, and Bidens [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2103.32s)]
*  told us no decent person would vote for him. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2106.32s)]
*  And yet he caused a landslide bigger than the cast [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2109.32s)]
*  of The View on a snowboarding trip. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2111.32s)]
*  That's why last night's reckoning signals [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2117.32s)]
*  something bigger even than Trump. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2120.32s)]
*  You can see it in the faces of those who voted for him [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2122.32s)]
*  and those who didn't. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2125.32s)]
*  The American people went from wanting to deciding. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2127.32s)]
*  And that decision is now reflected in the calm [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2130.32s)]
*  that you sense right now. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2132.32s)]
*  We may not get this country back on its feet tomorrow, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfiuS_g2NIU&t=2134.32s)]
