*  floating the idea of the United States owning and operating the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=5.54s)]
*  We'll have more on that later in the show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  They're using the old good cop bad cop routine in Washington. Trump's the good cop. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Elon's the bad cop. And Trump's fine with it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  The Times says he's moving at a speed and scale that's shocking civil servants. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  As Elon and his team are working with a frantic around the clock energy beds are being moved into the Eisenhower building. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=28.28s)]
*  So Musk's men can sleep at the office. Elon's nerd army a bunch of 18 to 25 year olds who rejected seven figure salaries in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=35.68s)]
*  Silicon Valley to trim fat in D.C. young engineers in black backpacks underpaid patriots hitting the federal bureaucracy with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=45.24s)]
*  A.I. and seeing what kind of waste fraud and abuse spills out for decades. Bald 60 year old inspector generals audited federal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=54.64s)]
*  agencies found pork wrote a report that no one read and nothing changed. Finally Trump assigned it to a pack of whiz kids and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=63.24s)]
*  were already saving a billion bucks a day. Pink slips are flying like confetti at the RNC. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Bureaucrats are showing up to the office and before they get coffee and log on. Doge says come into the conference room and sit down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=77.72000000000001s)]
*  This will only take a minute. Doge was in the building. We started we took down our pride flags. We took down. I took out any books I [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=85.04s)]
*  felt would be incriminating. No one was talking. We heard they started taking transcripts automatically of all of our Google [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=93.4s)]
*  feeds. We unplugged the news in the little kitchen galleys. It didn't feel good. And then Saturday all of the websites went down [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=99.48s)]
*  and then I lost complete access to my computer. Elon says we spent the weekend feeding USAID into the woodchipper. Could have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=110.12s)]
*  gone to some great parties. Did that instead. Mucks treating our foreign aid office like a crime scene. Democrats in Congress tried [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=118.04s)]
*  to see what Doge was doing but the doors were locked. So Elon Musk just shut the whole place down. So you're asking questions of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  individuals who don't have the answers for you except all of the wonderful press release that was released to the public. You say [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=134.68s)]
*  this quote. OK. So you are aware this agency is very busy currently and they are not able to take a meeting currently. They [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  advise that they will be in contact shortly and that best to contact the Department of State this time if you need any further [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=152.88s)]
*  comments. Who is the front office of the administration. Trump basically shut the government out of government and the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=159.52s)]
*  Democrats shrug turned around and went to dinner. This is what Democrats are fighting to save. These are some of the insane [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=167.28s)]
*  priorities that that organization has been spending money on. One point five million dollars to advance DDI in Serbia's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=175.4s)]
*  workplaces. Seventy thousand for a production of a musical in Ireland. 47000 for a transgender opera in Colombia. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=182.84s)]
*  Thirty two thousand for a transgender comic book in Peru. I don't know about you but as an American taxpayer I don't want my [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=192.52s)]
*  dollars going towards this crap. And I know the American people don't either. And that's exactly what Elon Musk has been tasked [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=199.08s)]
*  by President Trump to do to get the fraud waste and abuse out of our federal government. We can keep going. Twenty million [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=204.64s)]
*  dollars for Iraqi Sesame Street. Two million dollars for Moroccan pottery classes. Eleven million to tell Vietnam to stop burning [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  trash. Twenty seven million to give gift bags to illegals before we deport them. Millions to help Afghanis grow crops instead of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=219.92s)]
*  opium. That program was such a success that opium production doubled. We also gave Afghanistan 300 million to build diesel fuel [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=229.12s)]
*  power plants but they couldn't use them because diesel was too expensive. Two hundred million on a dam that was too unsafe to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=238.36s)]
*  ever be used. We could have used that dam in California. Two hundred and fifty million on a road that was never used. We [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  literally built a road to nowhere. Oh and we gave Syrians nine mil for humanitarian aid. But someone messed up and it went to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=253.92s)]
*  Al Qaeda. A million for bat research in Wuhan. That equates to a million dollars for each dead American. USAID was funding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=263.28s)]
*  Fashion Week in Paris. France isn't even paying its NATO dues and we're paying for their Fashion Week. USAID is a 40 billion dollar deep [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=273.96s)]
*  state social justice slush fund and the president says it's a little fishy. Elon Musk how often are you talking to him and how [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=285.2s)]
*  have been ideas that he's brought to you that you said oh no wait a minute this is going a little too far. Well many ideas but look [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=294.52s)]
*  he's done a great job. Look at all the fraud that he's found in this USAID. It's a disaster. What the people radical left lunatics. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=300.68s)]
*  They have things that nobody would have believed. The whole thing with 100 million spent on you know what. With money going to all sorts [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=312.08s)]
*  of groups that shouldn't deserve to get any money with the money. I'd like to see what the kickbacks are. How much money has been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=320.96s)]
*  kicked back. Who would spend that kind of money. USAID is an American intelligence cutout. They've been caught staging coup after [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=327.0s)]
*  coup across Latin America funding paramilitary groups and getting kicked out of countries for subversive activities. The deeper we [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=335.12s)]
*  investigated USAID the more it looks like a dark money Democrat super PAC. And if you take all of the executives from USAID the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=343.52s)]
*  Clinton Foundation the Gates Foundation the World Bank the WHO you get a Venn diagram that would tickle Kamala Harris. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=352.64s)]
*  Burisma got a contract with USAID through Hunter. It was so shady that the Obama White House was like that. Nice try and canceled it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=362.8s)]
*  Hunter's firm was repping clients who were trying to cash in on USAID disaster relief in Haiti. And by the way the Clinton [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=371.96s)]
*  Foundation worked arm in arm with USAID in Haiti and a billion dollars disappeared and Haiti is still Haiti. USAID was pouring [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=379.96s)]
*  billions into the hands of open borders groups. We were literally funding the invasion and buying them gift bags as they left. Here's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  Stephen Miller. There is probably no entity in the government that is more of an entrenched power center of unelected bureaucrats [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=398.32s)]
*  with less accountability less oversight than USAID. They funnel money to their cronies all over the world through a swampy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=406.76s)]
*  network of NGOs non-governmental organizations and cutouts including potentially some very troubling elements of focusing on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=414.96s)]
*  things like regime change and destabilizing foreign countries. But this is not about America's interests. Donald Trump is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=423.8s)]
*  courageously restoring democracy. Americans voted for one man Donald J. Trump. They voted for Donald Trump to make government [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=432.2s)]
*  accountable to the taxpayer. And USAID is only 0.7 percent of the federal budget. If they found this much fraud and corruption in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=440.88s)]
*  this one tiny agency imagine how bad the rest of it is. Imagine what we'll find in the Pentagon. We hit a nerve. And of all the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=449.28s)]
*  things that Trump's done in three weeks of all the things the media chose foreign aid getting dozed to go to war. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  What's happening right now is a hostile takeover of the U.S. government. I'm going to tell you right now people are going to die in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=467.6s)]
*  very large numbers around the world who are expecting the United States to live up to our promises to get them medicine to get them [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=474.68s)]
*  help. Donald Trump says we don't care. You go die. If this were happening in any other country right now I promise you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=479.92s)]
*  I'd be on the air calling it a coup. Cutting foreign spending is in a coup. Coups when you whack a doddering president from the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=489.6s)]
*  ticket. AOC whose district turned into a red light district because of Biden's migrants doesn't have a crush on Musk anymore. Now she [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=497.88000000000005s)]
*  thinks he's done. This dude is probably one of the most unintelligent billionaires I have ever met or seen or witnessed. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=507.0s)]
*  They don't do their homework clearly like they're putting 19 year olds in at the Treasury. This dude is not smart. And and the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=519.44s)]
*  danger in not in the lack of intelligence and the lack of expertise that Elon has. I mean this guy is one of the most morally [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=530.44s)]
*  vacant but also just least knowledgeable about these systems that we really know of. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=541.52s)]
*  A dumb billionaire doesn't shoot men into space like Musk. A dumb billionaire opens borders and prisons like Soros. Chuck Schumer [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=553.84s)]
*  dropped his Corona and guac and started singing. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=561.92s)]
*  And we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We won't rest. We won't rest. We won't rest. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=565.36s)]
*  Chuck sings better than he grills. But it wasn't just him. The whole Congress is hysterical. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=585.96s)]
*  No one elected Elon Musk to nothing. That's right. Not one Democrat in America voted for Elon Musk. What we not going to do is stand [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=592.2s)]
*  around. What I pull this bulls**t. We are going to be in your face. We are going to be on your asses. We will see you in the courts, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  in Congress, in the streets. Elon Musk is a Nazi nutball baby. Every movement needs a scrappy little d**k and I am that person. I need each [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=611.08s)]
*  and every one of you to get in touch with your inner scrappy little d**k. Nobody elected your ass. This is not Elon Musk's country. Take your [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=623.76s)]
*  foot off my neck. It's all women screaming and Chuck singing. No one voted for Dr. Jill but she was president for four years. When the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=636.6s)]
*  Democrats start caring about chain of command they got caught running a shadow government. The commander in chief had nap times. He had [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=647.72s)]
*  note cards to tell him where to sit. Senate Democrats say they're going to retaliate because unless Iraqis watch Sesame Street the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=655.52s)]
*  Constitution is in tatters. For them it's about power not your tax dollars. Democrats need dark money agencies like USAID to staff [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=663.24s)]
*  their cronies launder money wage information warfare and sabotage Trump. But Musk sniffed it out and doged them. They're not mad about [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=673.32s)]
*  the money. They're mad they got caught. The Trump doctrine it is in full effect. It is shock and awe. And the mainstream media and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=683.28s)]
*  Democrats they are in shambles freaking out. They have no idea what is going on. So as a public service tonight I will interpret for them [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=691.08s)]
*  exactly what he said and what his true intentions are. Just like he's starting a trade war. Oh there goes the economy. Oh my no they don't [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=701.08s)]
*  understand Donald Trump but I will help them. Anyway even Stephen A. Smith by the way is now calling his own party pathetic. Take a look. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=710.36s)]
*  The Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election. I might entertain running. I just might change my mind one day. I doubt it but I might. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  Because how much would it take to beat y'all. And Trump can't run again. And by the way Stephen A apparently thinking about possibly running for [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=731.36s)]
*  president. OK. And we'll challenge him on his recent support for D.E.I. Oh also stay tuned tonight. We have a preview. Yours truly will be in a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=741.92s)]
*  Super Bowl commercial. We have the ad and later Trump's special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witcoff will be with us just hours after the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=752.56s)]
*  president delivered this stern warning to the mullahs of Iran and much more. Take a look. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. With me it's very [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=761.4799999999999s)]
*  simple. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. We don't want to be tough on Iran. We don't want to be tough on anybody but they just can't have a [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=770.0799999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapon. Why say you're unhappy to sign it if it's Iran and their proxies who have threatened to retaliate against you and your team by [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=777.92s)]
*  killing you guys for taking out Soleimani. Well they haven't done that and that would be a terrible thing for them to do not because of me. If they [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  did that they would be obliterated. That would be the end. I've left instructions. If they do it they get obliterated. There won't be anything [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=798.2s)]
*  left and they should be able to do it. And Biden should have said that but he never did. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=806.96s)]
*  The president also introduced tonight a proposal for the future of Gaza. He said the Palestinian population needs to be absorbed by other [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=813.72s)]
*  countries. Gaza needs to be demilitarized and he's offering to do the job and rebuild it into a beautiful safe haven. Take a look. The only reason the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It's right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=832.3599999999999s)]
*  building is down. They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=842.1s)]

*  quote unquote left wing ideology. Elon Musk I mean this man is un-American as far as my definition of America is. And I just I'm the fact that more people aren't offended by this man's actions.

[[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1351.42s)]

*  Which you know you can probably even glean that from watching these people on TV. Anyways all of that is to say is that they don't do their homework. So I mean are Americans going to be OK with Musk. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1390.34s)]
*  No. Oh OK. A guy nobody voted for having all this kind of power. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1405.1399999999999s)]

*  OK. I'll put that in the back of my head. They hate Musk because he's exposing all of this misappropriation of your hard earned tax dollars. We'll scroll it again in a minute. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1429.22s)]
*  And also because he is helping Donald Trump fulfill his promise and we're returning to limited government greater freedom and not wasting our money abroad. But we're going to put the American people first. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1440.86s)]
*  And you want to go to war and you want to assassinate the character of Elon Musk who's doing this for free. Really. Remember we are 40 trillion dollars in debt. They are stealing your money. They are stealing the money for your children and your grandchildren. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1455.46s)]
*  And the Biden administration we just found out today made two hundred and thirty six billion dollars in improper payments last year alone. That's a quarter of a trillion dollars they wasted. And we're now beginning to see where they're spending that money because they get their power doing that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1472.06s)]
*  And the inflation under Biden devalued the dollar by more than 20 percent. A mega American struggling to get by. They're living paycheck to paycheck. They're paying the bare minimum on their credit cards. The Democratic Party is upset that all this money this insanity this [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1490.38s)]
*  DEI woke ideology. Green New Deal madness abroad not even for our country is no longer going to be able to fund transgender operas in Europe and DEI programs in Asia.

*  So is this a new golden age. And I don't mean the pee stains Joe left on the Oval Office rug. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1793.9s)]
*  The thing is with Trump getting so much done so fast you got to wonder what was the hold up. What was stopping us. Was the prices right on. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1801.46s)]
*  But maybe it's not just that Trump's making the moves. It's that most of us didn't know these moves were even possible. I mean who knew America could actually get big stuff done anymore. It's like if Stephen Hawking's wife woke up one day [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1810.42s)]
*  and found the kitchen spotless. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1822.98s)]

*  He would have laughed. It would have sounded weird but he would have laughed. It's not like he was going to get up and kick your ass. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1831.58s)]
*  I mean did any of us know that the Chinese had locked up a deal with the Panama anal until Trump called it out or that Venezuela had American hostages until Trump freed them or that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1840.6200000000001s)]
*  China was shipping in billions of cheap goods under something called the de minimis loophole which provided cover for fentanyl smuggling. I mean what's a de minimis loophole loophole. I had no idea. It sounds like a sex act from Star Wars. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1852.58s)]
*  One thing you could say about the Trump administration they're terrible at keeping government secrets and it's beautiful because suddenly we're all learning a hell of a lot that we didn't know before. For instance we can reduce 6000 border [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1868.34s)]
*  crossings a day to under 600. I haven't seen numbers drop like that since what he got on OZ MPEC. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1880.22s)]
*  Did you know there are more suspects on the terror watch list coming from Canada than Mexico. Did you know Canada is a major source of fentanyl entering the country. Did you know Canadian bacon is just mediocre ham. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1888.7s)]
*  I know I didn't and I'm the voice of a generation. I thought the only horrible thing Canada ever gave us was Seth Rogen. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1901.34s)]
*  Then there's Ukraine. Trump just told Zelensky that he expects our cash. Then we get the rare earth metals. You know the metals essential to our iPhones lithium batteries and little Wayne's teeth. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1912.58s)]
*  So that's new. Hell all Joe Biden got out of Ukraine was a fake job for his son. And the same goes for Greenland. Have you ever really ever thought about Greenland. Trump did. Suddenly we find out it's key to securing America's future [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1922.7800000000002s)]
*  shipping. Where the hell has all this intel been. Was it sitting in that file near Biden's Corvette. Just like the one with the addresses of all the rapists murderers and human traffickers that ICE has suddenly been able to round up. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1936.74s)]
*  And don't get me started with NGOs until Trump came along. I thought an NGO was something I picked up from a stripper on spring break. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1949.3799999999999s)]
*  Then there's USAID. It sounds like a patriotic sports drink. Turns out it's yet another federal agency none of us knew about which sent one billion of our cash to Gaza. Money that apparently went to Hamas. I guess ISIS only took Venmo. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1959.1799999999998s)]
*  They also spent millions of D.I. on places like Serbia Peru Guatemala and paid for a trend transgender opera in Colombia. What was that called. Madam Butterfly has a. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1974.22s)]
*  They helped the Taliban make heroin which they then spent on sluttier goats. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1989.46s)]
*  And let's not forget they also helped fund a certain Chinese lab in Wuhan which I think cancels all the humanitarian aid USAID claim to provide. So anyway Trump's been in charge a few weeks and we're suddenly getting a truth title wave. Love him or hate him. There's no denying Trump is where government secrets go to die. And you can follow all of it but only if you could keep up with the guy. Good luck with that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=1994.22s)]
*  And I guess. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2024.22s)]
*  His kids still haven't given him a forwarding address after writer comedian Jamie Lissow. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  There aren't many who are brighter than his very thoughtful writer attorney Julian Epstein. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2035.3s)]
*  Her maternity is taking an eternity. New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor Kat Toob. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2043.18s)]
*  And Greenland is his ice pack. New York Times bestselling author Fox News contributor comedian and the former. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2048.94s)]
*  Jamie. So when you hear about Trump's weekend you must feel even more worthless than you already feel. I mean you. What are your weekends. You take one of your estranged kids to McDonald's. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2062.22s)]
*  Parking lot. Yeah me him and the cop. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2073.5s)]
*  I really felt productive this weekend. All I did was put my garbage at the street and then I watched those guys take it. Yes. I was like that feels good. Isn't it fun though to watch the left go crazy like oh my God the president's doing stuff. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2079.1000000000004s)]
*  I know the president was allowed to do stuff. I thought we just Google them every day to find out if he was still alive. Like it's it's fascinating to watch. He's done so many things in high. What's it been. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2092.6200000000003s)]
*  Just over a week. Do you know when they asked Biden when he took office. Do you remember they asked him what he wanted for his first executive order. And he said cream of wheat. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2102.5s)]
*  Is there going to be a time that we retire the Joe Biden jokes. I say I hope so only because that means we won't have heard from him. But but until them these haven't expired yet. Great. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2114.98s)]
*  They have not. Julian welcome to the show. Thank you. How do the Democrats deal with this because you keep hearing that they're kind of overwhelmed. Well first thanks for having me on the show. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2125.26s)]
*  Democrats do this the same way they've been dealing with almost everything else the last 10 years which is a lot of contempt a lot of disdain and a lot of ad hominem name calling. When you swim in a culture long enough you don't notice the culture. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2135.5400000000004s)]
*  But this is all the Democrats stand for. They don't build anything anymore. It used to be a party that built things. Look at what happened in Los Angeles. Look at what happened with the train system here in New York. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2149.94s)]
*  Supposed to be done in 2009 started in 2009 still hasn't started. Democrats have lost the ability to build and all they do is sort of complain and and and and issue contempt citations. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2162.06s)]
*  But all they do. Trump on the other hand this has been remarkable what he's done. I mean it shows that he does what he promised he would say he would do which is very refreshing for American people. It shows an incredible business like efficiency and it shows strength. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2173.9s)]
*  You know like him or hate him. Donald Trump is a strong guy and even a very strong guy and a strong leader. And even when there were lots of sort of complaints from even some from places like the Wall Street Journal and conservative quarters about tariffs he doesn't back down. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2190.02s)]
*  And American people like somebody that doesn't back down. So it's quite a contrast between strength on the one hand showed by Trump and contempt by the Democrats which the American people don't like. Yeah. In fact it's like it's it's so strange [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2205.42s)]
*  that things are actually happening at this speed. Cat do you think Donald Trump is on something. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2219.26s)]
*  I don't actually. Yeah I don't. Yeah I don't. I was a trap to set you up. Yeah thank you for that. Exactly. That's exactly what I need. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2229.1800000000003s)]
*  A trap. You know I think that what's been the most remarkable has just been the light that's been shined on a lot of different things and kind of allowing people to think differently about stuff because I feel like before. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2237.86s)]
*  I mean it really is remarkable. You know that our tax dollars we pay so much that you know we get so little but just just how stupid some of the stuff is when you hear something like foreign aid you could never criticize that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2256.98s)]
*  What comes to mind when you hear foreign aid humanitarian you hear the kid right. Yeah the kid the kid in the pile of rubble like a little tin can. Yes. So they put oatmeal in. Right. And you're like who would take this from this kid. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2268.82s)]
*  You'd be a monster. But then you. But then you realize that OK they're also funding you know whatever diversity training in Serbia or whatever else all this other stuff. So actually just shining a light on these things I think in and of itself is a remarkable thing because it's. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2283.26s)]
*  And I hope that this happens across the department is the defense department as well. They fail every audit. I mean we need to look at the what kind of stuff that money is actually being spent on and not just relying on the positive branding that a lot of these words bring to mind. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2299.14s)]
*  Yeah it's a great point. Oh you one person's like hell yeah. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2314.66s)]
*  Tyrus it is a good point. It seems like Trump's administration is almost doing the work of investigative journalists should have done. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2318.38s)]
*  Well that would have been nice but you know journalists. Good luck finding them or a dodo. What he's President Trump learned a lot from not being in the office. Yeah. And the one thing he learned from the first time is that even when you get [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2333.34s)]
*  in the fight just begins and so many times when presidents have had the Senate and the House they think they had time they could spread things out. We can get a win here and then we can get a win there. No no no no. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2348.42s)]
*  And before they know it they don't have the House anymore. So everything ends up beginning shut down and slow down. He's not going to allow that to happen because and what he's doing and the way he's doing it with. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2360.94s)]
*  I mean he. I refer to him as a third black president but he is also the most arrogant black brother I have ever met in my life. And literally I got it. No. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2373.02s)]
*  He knows he's completely aware that everyone's going to find a way and eventually they're going to get to a couple of these Republicans. You know when when the lobbyists they're eventually going to get to a couple of Republicans [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2385.9s)]
*  all of a sudden they're going to be like oh I'm more conservative and I have issues with this. It always happens. So he's doing it now when they can't because everyone's watching and he's showing the show. But and then he has time to send a text on a Saturday night like yo guess who filled Kelly up with water Tyrus and with pitchers. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2398.1s)]
*  I'm like how do you have time for this because he is make he's not sleeping. Yeah he knows he's got 100 days to do what he needs to do. And you made a joke about a month ago and I think it's at two years he might be like I'm done. Yeah. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2416.58s)]
*  It's yours. Yeah. Deuces I'm out. I'll be golf and call me because he knows. No I think I think that's the plan is to get it done because he doesn't have to run for reelection. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2433.02s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this before. I mean it's very to Tyrus's point. It's very gangster. I mean you know politicians by their nature say let's do a commission study some for six months. Yeah. And we'll think about getting it done. Trump says F that I'm getting it done today. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2442.94s)]
*  Because the swamp will fight back. Yeah you do it like the Republicans would take their time like they're like it's like one chef working on an eight course meal and he's like McDonald's is fleeing the burgers in your face. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2456.7s)]
*  And you have fat faces. All right. I don't know why I said fat faces. I apologize. You're all very svelte to svelte. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBu0js7YWRc&t=2469.2599999999998s)]
