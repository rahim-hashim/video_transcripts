# Fox News Highlights - April 30th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo)
*  At first, Trump's on a roll. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2.0s)]
*  After months of negotiation, President Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=6.34s)]
*  just signed a landmark minerals deal with Ukraine's President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=8.72s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=12.48s)]
*  Now, this is going to give the United States access [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=13.56s)]
*  to valuable, really important rare earth minerals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=15.64s)]
*  Now, the man just doesn't stop. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=18.84s)]
*  Now, this comes after last night's Trump bonanza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=20.56s)]
*  Not only the rally, but Trump smashing the biased press, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=23.04s)]
*  as only Trump can do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=26.36s)]
*  When ABC empathizes with an illegal alien with MS-13 tattoos [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=27.88s)]
*  on his knuckles, this is what happens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=32.28s)]
*  On his knuckles, he had MS-13. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  There's a dispute over that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=37.48s)]
*  Well, wait a minute. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=38.04s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=39.0s)]
*  He had MS-13 on his knuckles tattoo. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=40.08s)]
*  Oh, he had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=42.44s)]
*  But let's move on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=44.68s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=45.56s)]
*  Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=46.16s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=47.64s)]
*  So let me just. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=49.16s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=49.72s)]
*  Terry, you can't do that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=50.56s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=52.04s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=54.16s)]
*  I picked you because frankly, I never heard of you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=55.4s)]
*  But that's OK. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=57.68s)]
*  I mean, this is a compliment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=58.6s)]
*  Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=59.88s)]
*  Pass the popcorn. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=63.12s)]
*  Trump exposes them at every turn. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=64.16s)]
*  We follow the legal process. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=67.4s)]
*  I can't have a trial, a major trial, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  for every person that came in illegally. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=72.72s)]
*  We have thousands of murderers that came in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=75.24s)]
*  We have to get them out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=78.44s)]
*  And we have to get them out fast. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=79.44s)]
*  Really bad guys. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=80.8s)]
*  But in our country, even bad guys get due process, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=81.6s)]
*  If people come into our country illegally, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  there's a different standard. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=88.12s)]
*  These are illegal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=89.36s)]
*  They came in illegally. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=90.76s)]
*  But they get due process. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, they get a process where we have to get them out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=97.28s)]
*  Do these reporters do any research? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=98.0s)]
*  We had a president that was grossly incompetent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=101.64s)]
*  You knew it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=104.0s)]
*  I knew it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  And everybody knew it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=105.2s)]
*  But you guys didn't want to write it [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  because you're fake news. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=107.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=108.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, ABC is one of the worst, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=110.44s)]
*  I have to be honest with you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=114.12s)]
*  This was thoroughly enjoyable. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=114.8s)]
*  OK, the reality show continues. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=117.44s)]
*  But you can only truly appreciate how hands-on Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=120.2s)]
*  is as president, how forward-thinking he is, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=123.28s)]
*  when you're reminded of how bad President Biden was. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=126.36s)]
*  Now, remember Biden's first cabinet meeting? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=130.12s)]
*  It wasn't until April 1st of 2021. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  But counting today's for Trump, Trump's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=135.28s)]
*  already held three public cabinet meetings [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=137.44s)]
*  and gave the press almost unfettered access. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=140.0s)]
*  We'll go around the table and you can hear it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=143.4s)]
*  And these are cabinet meetings where [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=145.52s)]
*  they're very open and transparent. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=147.08s)]
*  And I can guarantee you, Biden didn't do this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=148.84s)]
*  No, he did not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, on his good days, Biden would basically [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=153.32s)]
*  read an opening statement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=155.32s)]
*  Then his staff would shoe reporters out of the room. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=157.56s)]
*  Now, wait for the bonus at the end of this one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=161.36s)]
*  While most of the cabinet will have a role [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  in helping shape and press the jobs plan, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=165.96s)]
*  today I'm announcing that I'm asking five cabinet members [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=169.44s)]
*  to take special responsibility. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=173.8s)]
*  Now, we've got a lot of business to do and get done. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=175.72s)]
*  I thank the press for being here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=180.32s)]
*  But talk to you all later. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=182.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=185.48s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=186.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=187.48s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=188.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=189.48s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=190.48s)]
*  I mean, everything about that was bad. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=191.48s)]
*  No questions from reporters. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=200.44s)]
*  Then, of course, the social distancing with the masks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  COVID performance theater. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=206.56s)]
*  Never forget that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, in fact, Biden's staff had such little confidence [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  in his cognitive ability that they didn't schedule [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  regular cabinet meetings. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  Or they just scripted them all when they did occur. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, back in July of last year, a source told CNN [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=220.16s)]
*  that the entire display is kind of an act. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=223.16s)]
*  They would come and say, hey, the president [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=226.48s)]
*  is going to call on you about 25 minutes in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  and ask this question. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=231.88s)]
*  What are the bullet points you'll respond with? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  He was so decrepit that Joe even turned over [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  his final cabinet meeting to his wife. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  Weak, weak, weak. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=244.32s)]
*  But with Trump, it's strength all the way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=246.84s)]
*  Now, while some prior Republican presidents [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=250.44s)]
*  might be cowed by some less than fantastic poll numbers, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  not Trump, he goes on the offensive [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  and stays on the offensive on the issues that matter. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=258.16s)]
*  After Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy spoke today [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=261.72s)]
*  about the outdated air traffic control technology we have, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=264.76s)]
*  Trump swooped in and added some key details. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=268.56s)]
*  Buttigieg did a horrible job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=271.8s)]
*  They wasted billions and billions of dollars. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=274.48s)]
*  Hooking up wire equipment to non-wire equipment [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=276.52s)]
*  to satellite equipment. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=279.96s)]
*  And a third grade student would know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=281.28s)]
*  it doesn't work, it can't work. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=284.64s)]
*  And they wasted tens of billions of dollars. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=286.0s)]
*  But we want to put a brand new air traffic control system in. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=290.2s)]
*  I mean, what president gets into the details like that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=294.56s)]
*  Now, for more than two hours, Trump, Vance, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  every cabinet official, and even his chief of staff [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  gave important updates to the American people. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  No hiding, all on camera. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=305.92s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi spoke about shutting down the cartels. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=308.88s)]

*  The Biden administration was a vector [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=681.1s)]
*  for child sex trafficking. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=683.22s)]
*  Someone needs to go to prison. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=685.26s)]
*  Trump's happy with his team. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=687.58s)]
*  He gave them all Gulf of America hats, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=688.86s)]
*  his little party favors. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=690.66s)]
*  Elon took two. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=692.1s)]
*  Elon, I love the double hat by the way. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=694.26s)]
*  He's the only one that can do that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  Get away with it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=699.06s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, they say I wear a lot of hats. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=700.26s)]
*  That's true. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=703.22s)]
*  Even my hat has a hat. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=706.46s)]
*  We have an exclusive interview with Elon Musk [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=710.98s)]
*  airing tomorrow night. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=713.02s)]
*  And yes, he's bringing big balls. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=714.26s)]
*  And it might be his exit interview. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=717.26s)]
*  The vast majority of people in this country [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=720.06s)]
*  really respect and appreciate you. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=723.5s)]
*  And this whole room can say that very strongly, really. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=725.34s)]
*  It's been a tremendous help. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  You opened up a lot of eyes as to what could be done. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=730.14s)]
*  And we just want to thank you very much. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=732.6600000000001s)]
*  And you know, you're invited to stay as long as you want. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=734.38s)]
*  At some point, I guess he wants to get back home [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=738.7s)]
*  to his car. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=741.22s)]
*  And it's time. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=742.9s)]

*  Doe saved us 160 billion in counting. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=748.7s)]
*  And there's still entire departments being slimmed down. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=752.46s)]
*  I don't think I have ever worked so hard [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=756.38s)]
*  to try to fire myself. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=758.02s)]
*  We're certainly making great strides in that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=762.14s)]
*  We've reduced the folks over [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=764.26s)]
*  at the Department of Education by about 50% now. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  The first 100 days have been so historic. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=772.78s)]
*  The New York Times put out a front page to match. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=775.06s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=777.34s)]
*  There have never been a hundred days like this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=778.18s)]
*  And they're right about that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=781.14s)]
*  And the media is gonna seduce you with polls [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=783.1s)]
*  to say Trump's unpopular. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=784.9s)]
*  But these are the same polls that told you [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=786.38s)]
*  Kamala would win Iowa. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=787.9s)]
*  The country has no regrets. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=790.02s)]
*  If the election was held again, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=791.9s)]
*  the media's same silly polls say Trump would still beat her. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=793.86s)]
*  The country elected Amanda knock over the table [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=797.9s)]
*  and that's the phase we're in now. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=800.4200000000001s)]
*  And soon we'll reset the table. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=802.82s)]
*  Salad, dinner, dessert, fork. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=805.1s)]
*  We're turning it around. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=808.22s)]
*  It's a big shift to turn around. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=809.1s)]
*  And we're gonna have the greatest country financially [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=810.5400000000001s)]
*  in the history of the world, I believe. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  I think we're gonna do things that, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=814.7s)]
*  and we had to do it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=816.62s)]
*  We reset the table. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=817.46s)]
*  The pundits are panicking. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=818.9s)]
*  But what do the people think? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=820.74s)]
*  I think he's amazing. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=823.34s)]
*  I believe he's a man of his word. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=824.94s)]
*  And I really like that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=827.5s)]
*  because I had given up on politics. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=829.38s)]
*  I've been very pleasantly surprised [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=832.0600000000001s)]
*  with what he's doing to the country. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=833.98s)]
*  I think he's got a really good cabinet. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=835.94s)]
*  We're going in the right direction. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=837.94s)]
*  If these jobs are not here, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=839.98s)]
*  what happens when everything that we have is outsourced [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=842.22s)]
*  and that's exactly what has been going on for decades, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=845.5s)]
*  he's looking to bring it back. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=848.9000000000001s)]
*  If President Trump is watching us, I love you dearly. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=850.5s)]
*  Signature American companies like Ford [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  love what they're seeing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=857.4200000000001s)]
*  Ford is really different. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=859.94s)]
*  We make 80% in the US more than any other manufacturer. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  We think this is really great for the country. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=864.7800000000001s)]
*  We really support the president's initiative. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=867.6600000000001s)]
*  This is the right thing to do. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=870.14s)]
*  We really appreciate the dialogue [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=871.34s)]
*  we've had with the president, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=873.02s)]
*  but we have a lot more work to do with him and the team. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=874.34s)]
*  Today, CEOs of the biggest companies in the world [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=878.22s)]
*  packed into the White House [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=880.6600000000001s)]
*  to celebrate the manufacturing boom. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=881.9s)]
*  Money is pouring in. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=884.26s)]
*  The companies represented in this room [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=886.5400000000001s)]
*  have collectively announced [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=888.46s)]
*  more than $2 trillion in new investments, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=889.94s)]
*  and we have a total of close to $8 trillion all told. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  Today, first quarter GDP came out flat, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=898.7800000000001s)]
*  but even the New York Times called it a statistical fluke. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=901.74s)]
*  The market shrugged it off. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=904.82s)]
*  Regular folks don't live and die by GDP, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=906.1s)]
*  and Trump's confident the golden age will shine. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=908.6600000000001s)]
*  He's so confident, he sat down with a guy who hates him. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=911.4200000000001s)]
*  Terry Moran. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=914.86s)]
*  Who's Terry Moran? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=916.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=919.1400000000001s)]
*  He's a third stringer at ABC. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=920.38s)]
*  Stephanopoulos was not available [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=922.7s)]
*  because he slandered 47 and cost his bosses 15 mil in damages, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=924.4200000000001s)]
*  and David Muir moderated the last debate [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=929.1400000000001s)]
*  so poorly he was out. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=931.38s)]
*  So Moran was the man. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=933.3s)]
*  Not really. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=935.42s)]
*  I've given you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=937.18s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=938.98s)]
*  I picked you because frankly I never heard of you, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=940.22s)]
*  but that's okay. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=942.54s)]
*  I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=943.38s)]
*  Terry had a lot to prove, but it didn't work out for him. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=948.3s)]
*  He played the same old games ABC always plays. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=951.66s)]
*  They won a scalp, Pete's. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=954.7s)]
*  We had a good talk. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=958.34s)]
*  He's a talented guy. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=959.2199999999999s)]
*  He's young, smart, highly educated. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=960.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think he's gonna be a very good defense, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=964.9s)]
*  hopefully a great defense secretary, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=967.5s)]
*  but he'll be a very good defense secretary. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=969.18s)]
*  You have 100% confidence in Pete. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=970.66s)]
*  I don't have 100% confidence in anything. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=972.62s)]
*  Okay, anything. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=976.3s)]
*  Do I have 100%? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=977.3s)]
*  It's a stupid question. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=978.8599999999999s)]
*  Look. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  It's pretty important position. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  I have, no, no, no. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=982.54s)]
*  You don't have 100%. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=984.18s)]
*  Only a liar would say I have 100% confidence. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=985.74s)]
*  I don't have 100% confidence [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=989.3s)]
*  that we're gonna finish this interview. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=990.94s)]
*  These gotcha questions don't really work on Trump. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=993.86s)]
*  He's been in the gauntlet for a decade, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=995.94s)]
*  and confrontation actually ups his game. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=997.54s)]
*  Terry didn't do his homework, and it showed. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1000.38s)]
*  A legal note, fraud is a crime. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1003.58s)]
*  There have been no referrals [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1005.22s)]
*  to the Justice Department on any of this. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1006.22s)]
*  Well, you don't know that, do you? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1007.42s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1009.62s)]

*  Very closely with your great attorney general's team [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1186.82s)]
*  at the DEA to get these known cartels into our systems, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1190.74s)]

*  Of course, we begin with a joint session of Congress. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  And a reminder, this was not an audition [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1767.76s)]
*  to play the next Chewbacca. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1770.4799999999998s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1777.56s)]
*  Take your seat, sir. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1779.52s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1781.94s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1785.0600000000002s)]
*  OK, homeless Moses. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1794.94s)]
*  Then we got the kindest singing that would have made Van [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1799.98s)]
*  Goh cut off his other ear. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1802.66s)]
*  This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1806.0600000000002s)]
*  Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1811.9s)]
*  Silence lights the way. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1816.88s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Yoko Ono. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1820.72s)]
*  Then we got a filibuster, which is a fancy word of saying, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1825.68s)]
*  I won't shut up. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1829.4s)]
*  When is it going to be enough? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1831.8000000000002s)]
*  I will not stand for another American [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1833.3600000000001s)]
*  to lose their health care for a billionaire. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1835.4s)]
*  I don't want a dissonification of our history. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1837.44s)]
*  I don't want a whitewashed history. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1841.26s)]
*  I don't want a homogenized history. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1842.66s)]
*  Today and to tomorrow, I'm going to stand as long as I can. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1844.18s)]
*  We the people, we're going to stand up. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1847.9s)]
*  We're going to stand up. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1851.38s)]
*  You know, they'd have arrested him for loitering [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1854.18s)]
*  if they didn't think he'd like it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1856.6200000000001s)]
*  I wonder if such grandstanding is a hit with the ladies. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1860.1s)]
*  Hi, kid, that guy's about as straight [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1863.46s)]
*  as Steve Buscemi's teeth. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1864.94s)]
*  Up next, JB, which stands for Junior Blimp. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1866.26s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1875.8s)]
*  for mobilization, for disruption. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1879.72s)]
*  But I am now. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1882.72s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1884.44s)]
*  The only mass disruption we have to worry about from him [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1889.48s)]
*  is when he busts through a wall like the Kool-Aid man. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1892.4s)]
*  He wants Republicans to never know peace? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1896.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just like the plumber, he keeps on retainer. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1899.0s)]
*  Then there's Walt still lingering [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1902.88s)]
*  like a fart in a car seat. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1905.0s)]
*  Hang on my phone. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  I know some of you know this on the iPhone. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1908.64s)]
*  They've got that little stock app. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1910.14s)]
*  I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1911.72s)]
*  $225 and dropping. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1916.76s)]
*  That was their token masculine male. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1920.12s)]
*  I've seen balls of yarn with more testosterone. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1923.84s)]
*  But what did his shock troops do? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  Vandalize Teslas, burn down dealerships. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1930.52s)]
*  You think Walt will visit them in jail? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1933.72s)]
*  Only if it's conjugal. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1936.1999999999998s)]
*  Or conjugal. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1939.28s)]
*  Conjugal. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1940.1999999999998s)]
*  No, I don't like that person. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1941.56s)]
*  Conjugal. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1942.8s)]
*  That's if you're Jewish. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1943.96s)]
*  Conjugal if you're Jewish. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  Conjugal if you're not. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1948.52s)]
*  Then there was spring break. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1954.76s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen took off for El Salvador on our time [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1956.16s)]
*  and our dime to rub elbows with a wife-beating MS-13 gang [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1959.44s)]
*  member, or as the Dems call him, a Maryland dad. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1963.44s)]
*  Which is like saying Ted Bundy was a dating expert [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1967.44s)]
*  from Vermont. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1970.0s)]
*  Not to be outdone, Bernie and AOC took to a private jet [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1972.4s)]
*  around the country to fight oligarchy. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1976.16s)]
*  What's next? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1978.8000000000002s)]
*  A polo match in support of struggling glue factories? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1979.64s)]
*  All of this culminated yesterday with this call [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1985.24s)]
*  for impeachment. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1987.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1989.52s)]
*  But defying a unanimous 9-0 Supreme Court ruling? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1994.24s)]
*  That has to be the final straw. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=1999.16s)]
*  It's time we impeached Donald J. Trump. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2000.92s)]
*  Is that even real? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2005.48s)]
*  I mean the hair. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2009.2s)]
*  The hair, not the impeachment. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen hair that fixed since Rashida Tlaib [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2012.96s)]
*  wore a tank top. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2015.24s)]
*  But man, are the Dems getting impatient. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2018.68s)]
*  Trump's first impeachment came 173 days into his first term. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2021.92s)]
*  Here it's 99 days. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2026.04s)]
*  Makes you think, what are they going to do for his third term? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  Of course, there's as much a chance that Trump will be [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2031.2s)]
*  impeached as there is a Joy Behar ever seeing her feet. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  Making it the perfect metaphor for the Dems' first 100 days. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2039.96s)]
*  Fake, pointless, all for show. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2043.3600000000001s)]
*  Of course, that's what the Dems did. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2045.44s)]
*  But what about what they didn't do? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2047.72s)]
*  Well, they didn't support the Lincoln-Riley Act [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2049.44s)]
*  or making government more efficient [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2051.64s)]
*  or protecting women's sports. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2053.16s)]
*  No wonder their popularity ratings are as high as the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2055.08s)]
*  No wonder their popularity ratings are as high as [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2058.6000000000004s)]
*  Stevie Wonder's bowling score. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  But the Dems still have the media. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2064.92s)]
*  The Trump White House has faced 92% negative coverage [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2066.6400000000003s)]
*  from ABC, NBC, CBS. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2069.5600000000004s)]
*  However, in their defense, all three [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  believe they can get that up to 100% no time. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2074.6400000000003s)]
*  But the Dems' theatrics are proof [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2078.84s)]
*  of the party's inherent failures. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2080.36s)]
*  Their ideology is based on internal conflict. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2082.0800000000004s)]
*  And a competition between the aggrieved [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2086.04s)]
*  never generates a leader. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2088.16s)]
*  Only miserable followers at each other's throats. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2090.4s)]
*  So it's been a glorious first 100 days for the Dems. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2093.64s)]
*  Here's to another 100 if they make it that far. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2096.52s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's girls. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2101.36s)]
*  She uses those glasses to expose stupid jackasses. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2104.36s)]
*  Rosa Kennedy saves the world podcast, Kennedy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2109.08s)]
*  He's proof that Jews don't run show business. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2111.56s)]
*  Give me your rich boss. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2114.56s)]
*  He's proof that Jews don't run show business. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2115.56s)]
*  Give me your rich boss. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2117.56s)]
*  She once talked a guy into jumping off a cliff. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2121.96s)]
*  Co-host of Out and Over at Emily Capagno. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2125.56s)]
*  And for him, every van is a minivan. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2130.68s)]
*  New York Times bestseller, give me the info. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2133.84s)]
*  Give me that info. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2135.84s)]
*  Kennedy, when you go through that entire mosaic [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2136.84s)]
*  of the last 100 days, it's kind of amazing [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2143.96s)]
*  like what the Dems have done [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2147.7200000000003s)]
*  in their own frustration and desperation. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2149.76s)]
*  What say you? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2153.36s)]
*  Yeah, a 25 hour, it wasn't even a filibuster. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2154.48s)]
*  It was just a guy who wouldn't shut up for a day [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2158.2400000000002s)]
*  and an hour, who then was so exhausting [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2161.44s)]
*  he had to go have a sit in. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2164.32s)]
*  Outside of his own office. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2166.32s)]
*  And then JB Pritzker, who was calling for essentially [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2168.92s)]
*  a stampede, which is very dangerous [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2172.2000000000003s)]
*  if he's running to anything. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2173.84s)]
*  I'd rather give the elephants in the zoo a manicure. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2176.96s)]
*  And he's also, he says that the country right now, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2180.84s)]
*  it's a five alarm fire. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2184.4s)]
*  But I think what he really means is five alarm chili. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2186.1600000000003s)]
*  He just wants to eat anything he possibly can. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2188.8s)]
*  So you're looking at a group of people who are hysterical, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2191.88s)]
*  devoid of ideas and just out to outperform each other [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2195.88s)]
*  with these meaningless stunts, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2199.6s)]
*  which is exactly what voters voted against. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2201.56s)]
*  If they wanted meaningless blather, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2204.52s)]
*  we'd have President Kamala right now. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2206.2400000000002s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2208.12s)]
*  You know, Rich. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2210.6s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2211.44s)]
*  Um. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2212.44s)]
*  How was your last 100 days? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2213.28s)]
*  Well, it's been great. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2218.32s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2219.48s)]
*  I loved him with Key and Peele. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2220.8s)]
*  Uh. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2222.8399999999997s)]
*  He does look like, no, he does. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2225.68s)]
*  And the guy next to him looks like [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2229.7599999999998s)]
*  he's drinking meatloaf milkshakes. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2231.08s)]
*  Here's. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2233.16s)]
*  See, for me, 100, okay. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2235.64s)]
*  I really don't care about the price of gas, stocks, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2237.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, eggs. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  I get eggs free. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2245.12s)]
*  My friend has sturdy chickens. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2245.96s)]
*  Oh, good for you. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2247.48s)]
*  If you want eggs, I can make a call right now. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2248.3199999999997s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2250.6s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2251.44s)]
*  I'm about to get 3.1 million calls, bro. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2253.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2254.76s)]
*  I can get eggs. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2255.6s)]
*  So none of that matters to me. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2258.1600000000003s)]
*  You know what matters to me is what's going on in Israel, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2259.52s)]
*  what's going on on these campuses, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  and take off your masks. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2265.52s)]
*  That's what I care about. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2267.6s)]
*  That's my main goal. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2268.96s)]
*  Now, also, everything isn't positive with the president. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2270.12s)]
*  You know, there's so many things I like that Trump's doing, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2273.88s)]
*  but the fact that he's selling sneakers and watches, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2277.08s)]
*  I don't want my president to have a side hustle, okay. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2281.16s)]
*  I don't want to see my president in front of check cashing [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2285.12s)]
*  selling do rags and incense, all right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2289.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2292.64s)]
*  Which is ironic, because that's how you're dressed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2293.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2295.3999999999996s)]
*  But let me finish. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2296.24s)]
*  My first 100 days have been great. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2301.96s)]
*  They've been good. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2304.56s)]
*  You know, I see a lot of change [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2305.68s)]
*  for the things that I care about. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2307.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's good. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2309.8s)]
*  And I keep getting called back here. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  So what the hell? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2314.04s)]
*  What else can I ask? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2314.96s)]
*  Well, it's usually when somebody calls in sick. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2315.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2317.6000000000004s)]
*  You get to the Vs and I'm here. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2318.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2320.44s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2322.1600000000003s)]
*  We always have you scheduled on well in advance, a few hours. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2323.0s)]
*  Emily, how would you grade the Dems' first 100 days [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2326.32s)]
*  under Trump? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2331.5600000000004s)]
*  Have they done enough to convince voters [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2332.4s)]
*  that they deserve another chance? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  No, F minus minus minus, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2336.1200000000003s)]
*  unless they're being graded on utter failure [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2337.68s)]
*  and missing the point, then it's an A plus. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  I loved what you mentioned about, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2342.8399999999997s)]
*  they're missing the entire point [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2344.96s)]
*  and that they have been missing purpose [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2347.04s)]
*  and policy this entire time. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2349.56s)]
*  So the playbook that we're watching, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2351.3999999999996s)]
*  we're all sitting here in the front row, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2352.8399999999997s)]
*  just watching them exhaust this tired playbook. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2354.44s)]
*  We're day 99, it's impeachment. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2356.8799999999997s)]
*  And then what happens next? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2358.52s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffreys says that the president [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2359.96s)]
*  is not cognitively fit to start. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2362.3599999999997s)]
*  Like we're on that page now. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2364.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2365.72s)]
*  You helped gloss over the last four years [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2366.56s)]
*  and you are saying that now. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2368.7999999999997s)]
*  I love today in the cabinet meeting [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2371.04s)]
*  when the attorney general talked about what hasn't happened. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2372.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's just as important [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2375.68s)]
*  as what has in the last 100 days [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2377.2s)]
*  that this president has accomplished. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2378.68s)]
*  When she talked about the amount of fentanyl [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2380.2s)]
*  that has been seized, the dearth of the border crossings, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2381.7999999999997s)]
*  relating to millions of Americans' lives that were saved. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2385.7999999999997s)]
*  And the fact that the media refuses to cover it, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2390.04s)]
*  the Dems refuse to thank this president for it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2392.32s)]
*  They made fun of her over that line. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2394.92s)]
*  They thought, oh, how could she prove that? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2396.96s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2398.48s)]
*  You know, you didn't bother checking Joe Biden's pulse. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2399.56s)]
*  And it does, I think that level of like, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  attempting to find the data, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2408.28s)]
*  the data within the last four years. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2410.96s)]
*  The data is Lakin Riley, the data is Jocelyn Nungari. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2413.0s)]
*  That won't happen under this president. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2416.92s)]
*  The inflation, the fact that we all lost 20 pounds [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2419.4s)]
*  just the day after the election [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2421.76s)]
*  because President Trump is the one in the White House, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2423.0s)]
*  that is the good part. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2424.96s)]
*  The Dems failing to see that or even work on it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2427.24s)]
*  One point, one message, one leader whatsoever. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2429.44s)]
*  It's failure, A plus in failure. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2432.8s)]
*  Tyrus. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2434.52s)]
*  What it is. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2435.44s)]
*  What it is, what it shall be. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2436.28s)]
*  Yes, well said, Gutfeld, well said. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2439.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2441.72s)]
*  The man, the left. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2444.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2447.28s)]
*  There on that photo right there [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2448.6s)]
*  is the Mount Rushmore for birth control. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2450.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, President Trump tried to do [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2456.16s)]
*  a stimulus package where he had offered 5,000 [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2458.44s)]
*  to make babies with that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2461.24s)]
*  We need to raise it up to 10. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2462.52s)]
*  These, they have no focus because they never really did. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2465.44s)]
*  They're the, it's the activists and these are the activists. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2471.24s)]
*  They make up that's not real. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2473.68s)]
*  They don't even, when they do have an opportunity, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2476.12s)]
*  they're so within themselves that they don't even know [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2479.32s)]
*  what to do with it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2481.6800000000003s)]
*  For example, if you are going to talk for 24 hours, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2482.84s)]
*  why in the blue would you talk fast? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2488.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2491.6400000000003s)]
*  Did anyone else see? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2495.48s)]
*  Right, you got 24 hours. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  Slow that down. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2500.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2501.36s)]
*  I'd be breaking out the books. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2503.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll sit down and we're gonna read the story [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2504.88s)]
*  of the old yeller. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2506.8s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2508.8399999999997s)]
*  Like at least make it interesting. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2509.68s)]
*  They have no charisma. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2510.8799999999997s)]
*  They have nothing that attracts people to them, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2513.3199999999997s)]
*  i.e. the photo. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  But, and that's their problem. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2518.12s)]
*  They can't bring anybody in, but then again, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2520.3599999999997s)]
*  they don't really want anybody in. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2522.2799999999997s)]
*  They want their small bubble and the way they've done things [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2523.56s)]
*  for the last four years, they've been able to fleece [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2526.3999999999996s)]
*  this country at will, make up fake that people will buy [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2528.24s)]
*  and they had the propaganda media to support them. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2532.24s)]
*  So none of that has really changed. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2535.08s)]
*  So they're not ever gonna decide one morning to wake up [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2537.04s)]
*  and say, hey, I'm gonna be about facts and accountability. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2539.56s)]

*  But they don't. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2545.36s)]
*  They're gonna stick with feelings and emotions [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2546.44s)]
*  and what they little think tank groups [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2548.68s)]
*  because they're only working for the audiences of their ones. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2550.68s)]
*  As long as the CEOs of these networks allow these [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2554.36s)]
*  propagandist journalists to spew that stuff, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2558.32s)]
*  there's no reason for them to change. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2561.16s)]
*  Politicians will change if there's a reason to. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2562.4s)]
*  But in their mind, we keep doing this, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2564.8s)]
*  eventually something's gonna stick on the president. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2567.7200000000003s)]

*  because he's out there bobbing and moving [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2574.48s)]
*  and every time they try to throw something at him, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2575.92s)]
*  he's like, uh-uh. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDCEw4qSYFo&t=2577.48s)]
