# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 2, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA)
*  Hi everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=0.96s)]
*  I hope everyone had an amazing Thanksgiving. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=3.2s)]
*  We all know that Hunter Biden did. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The Gone Father, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=9.08s)]
*  Now, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, one and two, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=15.1s)]
*  are generally considered among the best films ever made. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=18.34s)]
*  They chronicled the Corleone family, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=22.56s)]
*  the battle among the mafia clans, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=25.16s)]
*  and the politicians and the police who gave them cover. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=28.4s)]
*  We're all grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=32.68s)]
*  We all know him as a man of his word, a modest man. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=36.28s)]
*  He'll always listen to reason. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=39.92s)]
*  Yes, Don Barzini, he's too modest. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=41.76s)]
*  He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=46.0s)]
*  The struggles of a wayward son. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=50.32s)]
*  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=53.64s)]
*  Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=58.48s)]
*  It ain't the way I wanted it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  I can handle things, I'm smart. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=65.16s)]
*  Not like everybody says. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=67.84s)]
*  Like dumb, I'm smart and I want respect. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=70.08s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=74.12s)]
*  But given what we've learned over the years [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=76.44s)]
*  about the long-term corruption and deception [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=78.28s)]
*  of the Biden family, the Corleones have nothing on them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=81.24s)]
*  Exactly, no one on earth with a functioning brain [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=85.44s)]
*  should have been surprised by Joe Biden's Thanksgiving pardon [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=89.96s)]
*  for his son Hunter. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=93.08s)]
*  He basically gives him 10 years, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=95.32s)]
*  anything you did illegal in this decade, forgiven. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  January 2014 through December 2024, which is interesting, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  because I think that's when Hunter Biden got involved [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=106.24s)]
*  with Ukrainian energy interests, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=109.08s)]
*  the charisma and the like. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=110.92s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=112.88s)]
*  But wait, the naive among us say, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=115.12s)]
*  that's not what Joe the protector of norms [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=118.0s)]
*  and democracy told us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=120.8s)]
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=123.48s)]
*  their verdict, no matter what it is? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=125.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=127.72s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=128.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=131.12s)]
*  I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=131.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna do anything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=134.12s)]
*  I said I'd buy by the jury decision, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=135.84s)]
*  I will do that and I will not pardon him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=138.16s)]
*  He had like every digit behind his back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=141.88s)]
*  Now the key thing here is everyone knew [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=145.96s)]
*  that Biden was lying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Yet because they knew it would hurt Biden politically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  and then help Trump, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  the entire political media establishment [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=154.88s)]
*  pretended otherwise. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=157.68s)]
*  He is not pardoning his son because he is living [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=159.92s)]
*  what it means to have a rule of law in this country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=164.8s)]
*  A presidential promise to put the law before a family, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=168.56s)]
*  letting the world know that he will not wipe away [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=172.52s)]
*  the decision of 12 of his son's peers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=175.4s)]
*  Our current president of the United States [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=178.2s)]
*  has so much respect for the law [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=181.28s)]
*  that he has said he would not pardon his son. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=183.68s)]
*  They were all enablers and everyone here is exposed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=187.6s)]
*  Biden, the media, Democrat staffers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=192.28s)]
*  This decision by the president [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=195.84s)]
*  to over the course of many months, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  insists publicly that he was not going to do this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  Everyone that I have spoken to so far [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  and that includes senior most former White House [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  and administration officials never believed the president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=209.08s)]
*  when he said he wasn't going to pardon his son. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=212.4s)]
*  They said this, anyone who was even close to the top [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=215.44s)]
*  knew that he was probably going to do this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  Why did we pretend otherwise? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=220.52s)]
*  Of course we know why they pretended otherwise. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=223.96s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=225.6s)]
*  They never believed Biden had clean hands here, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=227.28s)]
*  that he was some paragon of constitutional [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=230.04s)]
*  or any other type of virtue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=233.6s)]
*  And they never thought Trump was a threat to democracy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=235.48s)]
*  But they railed against Trump's claims [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=239.28s)]
*  that the DOJ was politicized. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=241.6s)]
*  They called that all that highly damaging [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=243.2s)]
*  to the DOJ's independence, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=246.16s)]
*  an unfair attack on the institution that keeps us safe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=248.6s)]
*  And now? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Does the president believe now [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=254.8s)]
*  and agree with president elect Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  that the justice system has been weaponized [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=258.68s)]
*  for political purposes [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=261.68s)]
*  and that it needs root and branch reform? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  No, read the president's statement. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=268.64s)]
*  Seriously, read the president's statement. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  He said he believes in the Department of Justice. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=272.36s)]
*  He does. He says it in his statement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  He believes, he also believes that rural politics [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  infected the process [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=281.16s)]
*  and it led to a miscarriage of justice. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=282.28s)]
*  He believes his son was unfairly targeted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  She should have submitted her resignation letter today. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=288.96s)]
*  And she would have, I think, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=291.88s)]
*  if she believed what they told her to say months ago, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  that Biden would not pardon Hunter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=297.88s)]
*  But look, if you were in on this from the beginning, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  you just keep the lie going. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=304.28s)]
*  And then you try to have it both ways. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  The president does believe in the justice system. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=308.44s)]
*  And the Department of Justice. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  And he also believes that his son [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=314.0s)]
*  was singled out politically. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=317.0s)]
*  And this is what we saw over and over and over again, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=318.88s)]
*  over the last couple of years. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=323.16s)]
*  Years? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=325.12s)]
*  Then why earlier this year [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=326.48s)]
*  did he say he would not pardon Hunter? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=328.04s)]
*  One of the reasons the president did the pardon [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=331.88s)]
*  is because it didn't seem like his political opponents [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  would let go of it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  It didn't seem like they would move on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  And so this is why this president took this action. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=341.36s)]
*  Okay, as usual, it's Trump's fault. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=343.8s)]
*  His political opponents wouldn't move on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=347.76s)]
*  Again, why is anyone surprised by this? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, she and the rest of the White House senior staff [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  covered up Biden's cognitive decline for years after all. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=356.36s)]
*  They lied that Joe was at the top of his game. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=360.92s)]
*  He had boundless energy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=363.24s)]
*  So of course they would go along with the pardon lie. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=365.16s)]
*  And these people talk about Trump's big lie? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=369.44s)]
*  The Biden family crime syndicate [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=373.08s)]
*  and all of their unindicted co-conspirators, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=375.52s)]
*  it was all built on a lie. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=378.8s)]
*  This family got rich by selling access, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=382.4s)]
*  or at least the appearance of access. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=385.02s)]
*  Any suggestion to the contrary? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=387.2s)]
*  Well, that was just a right-wing conspiracy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=389.32s)]
*  I don't know what he was doing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=392.52s)]
*  I never discussed a single thing with my son [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=394.08s)]
*  about anything having to do with Ukraine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=396.36s)]
*  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=397.96s)]
*  I have never discussed with my son or my brother [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=400.56s)]
*  or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=404.52s)]
*  Period. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=407.84s)]
*  All lies. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  And the only international business experience [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  that Hunter was an expert in involved harlots and cocaine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, with this pardon declared, in early December 2024, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  we all know what the Bidens and their collaborators did. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  They sold the ongoing family lies, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=429.72s)]
*  and they looked the other way on all of the corruption. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=432.88s)]
*  To them, it was worth risking their own reputations, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  their own credibility. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  And frankly, the credibility of the institutions, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=441.12s)]
*  they supposedly revere so much. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=443.0s)]
*  It was worth it to them in order to protect Biden [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=446.44s)]
*  and keep Donald Trump out of the White House. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=450.04s)]
*  Thank God they failed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  But we must never forget what they did [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=456.04s)]
*  and never let these sorts of people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=459.16s)]
*  close to the White House again. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  We told you Biden family thanksgivings are legendary. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=463.88000000000005s)]
*  And Nantucket was no different this year. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  We thought Frankie Fourfingers would lose another finger, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  but instead, the big guy gave Hunter an early Christmas gift, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=471.48s)]
*  a pardon over turkey dinner. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  Quote, no reasonable person who looks at the facts [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=478.88s)]
*  if Hunter's cases could reach any other conclusion [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=481.36s)]
*  than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is wrong. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=487.64s)]
*  I hope Americans will understand why a father [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=488.8s)]
*  and a president would come to this decision. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=491.4s)]
*  We were still picking at Thanksgiving leftovers [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=494.32s)]
*  when Joe pardoned his son and hopped on a plane to Africa. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=496.52s)]
*  The president wants change! [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=500.88s)]
*  Mr. Biden, I'm the pardon! [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, I want change! [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=503.44s)]
*  He went to Angola, 7,000 miles away. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=511.68s)]
*  Oh, and he left his wife home to face the music. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=515.64s)]
*  Dr. Biden, can you support the pardon of Hunter? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=519.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=522.04s)]
*  Pardon of Hunter, Dr. Biden. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=525.88s)]
*  Dr. Biden, what changed on the pardon of Hunter? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=529.68s)]
*  Pardon of Hunter. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=532.2s)]
*  Pardon of Hunter. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden's even leaking to CNN. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=536.24s)]
*  He wasn't really sure if he was gonna pardon Hunter, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=538.48s)]
*  but his wife made him do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=541.04s)]
*  You know women. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  Clearly there was pressure inside the family. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=544.64s)]
*  We were told really in recent weeks [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=546.64s)]
*  that Dr. Jill Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=548.04s)]
*  was very supportive of the president [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  doing something like this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=553.88s)]
*  The president was not sure, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=554.8s)]
*  but we clearly have seen now he has come to this decision [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  to pardon his son, Hunter. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  Biden pardons his son at his donor's Nantucket home, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=562.4s)]
*  throws his wife under the bus, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=565.92s)]
*  jets off to Africa, and makes a fool out of Binder. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=567.28s)]
*  Because this poor lady said a thousand times [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=570.76s)]
*  a pardon was off the table. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=573.12s)]
*  You've also said several times that the president [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  would not pardon or commute the census for his son, Hunter. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  I just wanna make sure that that is not gonna change [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  over the next six months. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  The president's saying no not. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=584.16s)]
*  It's still a no. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  It's still a no. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=587.24s)]
*  And will always be a no. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=588.08s)]
*  It's still a no. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=589.04s)]
*  It will be a no. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=589.88s)]
*  It is a no. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=590.96s)]
*  And I don't have anything else to add. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=592.2s)]
*  Will he pardon his son? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=594.0s)]
*  No. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=595.16s)]
*  I guess no means yes. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=596.24s)]
*  I believe now and agree with President-elect Trump [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=598.92s)]
*  that the justice system has been weaponized [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=603.48s)]
*  for political purposes and that it needs [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=606.48s)]
*  root and branch reform. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=609.52s)]
*  No, read the president's statement. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=613.44s)]
*  Seriously, read the president's statement. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=615.32s)]
*  He said he believes in the Department of Justice. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=617.16s)]
*  He does. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=619.76s)]
*  He also believes that rural politics infected the process [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=620.6s)]
*  and it led to a miscarriage of justice. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=623.28s)]
*  He believes his son was unfairly targeted. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  He said that what his political opponents have done [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=628.3599999999999s)]
*  to my son, that's his words, is cruel and enough is enough. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  So Biden is saying the Biden Justice Department [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=636.16s)]
*  was weaponized against Hunter, but not against Trump. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=639.16s)]
*  The same Justice Department. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=642.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=644.92s)]
*  It's fitting that Biden's presidency started [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  with a coverup and ended with one. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  The laptop, the lab leak, his health, the coup, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=650.3599999999999s)]
*  and then a blanket pardon that historians are saying [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=652.8s)]
*  is bigger in scope than Richard Nixon's. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=655.52s)]
*  Biden went from my son did nothing wrong [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=659.28s)]
*  to here's a pardon that goes back a decade. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  42 year sentence for tax and gun felonies, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  ah, it's the crack's fault. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=666.72s)]
*  Biden went from I never talked business with my son [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  to yeah, it's spaghetti dinners with his Ukrainian clients, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=671.96s)]
*  but we just talked about the weather. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=674.56s)]
*  I didn't think it was possible for Biden [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=677.36s)]
*  to humiliate the Democrats any more than he already has. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=679.04s)]
*  We all knew his son was gonna get pardoned. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=682.16s)]
*  No one would ever let their son go to prison [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=686.44s)]
*  if they had the power to stop it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  But just like every hoax, whether it's Russia or Smollett [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=691.08s)]
*  going out for a footlong at 2 a.m. January in Chicago, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=694.08s)]
*  the media fell for it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=698.04s)]
*  They said Joe had principles. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=700.12s)]
*  A presidential promise to put the law before a family. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=703.28s)]
*  Our current president of the United States [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=707.12s)]
*  has so much respect for the law [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=710.24s)]
*  that nobody would not pardon his son. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=712.68s)]
*  I mean, what, you know, again, it's all about the contrast. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=714.84s)]
*  He is not pardoning his son, which he could do. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  He is not doing it because he is living [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=723.48s)]
*  what it means to have a rule of law in this country. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=726.16s)]
*  And then it is, I mean, if you wanna know [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=729.96s)]
*  if he believes it, you could actually see [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=732.72s)]
*  what is happening with his own son. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=736.36s)]
*  Mm, yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=739.36s)]
*  This whole time, Biden was the lying dog-faced pony soldier. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  How the heck did the media get to a place [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=744.7600000000001s)]
*  where they assume any politician is telling the truth? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=746.72s)]
*  Finally, the left is as sick as being lied to as we are. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=750.32s)]
*  Now, we'd have a lot more respect for Biden [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=754.96s)]
*  if he had said, yeah, I'm gonna pardon Hunter. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=757.12s)]

*  But he acts like he has a monopoly on morality. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=760.7600000000001s)]
*  At least Trump doesn't make promises [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  he knows he's gonna break. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  You might not agree with what he does, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=767.44s)]
*  but when he says he's gonna pardon Jan Sixers, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=769.12s)]
*  he'll probably do it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=771.48s)]
*  Recess his cabinet, he'll probably do it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=772.84s)]
*  Fire the FBI director, he's done it once, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  he'll do it again. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=778.12s)]
*  Joe Biden tells you he's George Washington, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=779.88s)]
*  and then he acts like Benedict Arnold. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  And it breaks the Democrats' heart every time. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  I just want Democrats to stop acting like [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=787.72s)]
*  they are on this moral high ground politically. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=789.24s)]
*  When they have shown us they're not, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=791.44s)]
*  whether it's skipping the primary process [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=793.0s)]
*  when Biden stepped down to things like Biden [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=794.72s)]
*  pardoning his son. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=796.44s)]
*  Stop acting like you're the pure party [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=797.88s)]
*  and Republicans aren't. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Toobin, who knows a little something [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=801.76s)]
*  about dishonoring the office, says, quote, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=803.76s)]
*  Biden's pardon for his son dishonors the office. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=806.24s)]
*  Governor of Colorado, a Democrat, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=809.88s)]
*  says Biden put his family ahead of the country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=811.76s)]
*  And now Biden's legacy is in the crosshairs, again. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  This pardon is just deflating. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=820.0s)]
*  Joe Biden just made clear his son Hunter is above the law. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=822.48s)]
*  Is a really bad look for him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=826.64s)]
*  And I think it's potentially a destructive thing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=829.76s)]
*  for his party. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=833.64s)]
*  People's opinions that the system is somehow stacked [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=834.64s)]
*  in favor of Democrats against Republicans. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  I think this looks like the nation's head Democrat [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=840.76s)]
*  using the system for his own benefit. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=843.6s)]
*  This pardon will tarnish Joe Biden's legacy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=845.72s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden, let's be clear here, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=848.44s)]
*  he lied to us for a long time. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=850.52s)]
*  The media is even having Democrats do the walk of shame [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  for lying to their audience. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=856.08s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  In July of 2023, just after that plea deal fell through, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=858.36s)]
*  this is what you said, I wanna watch. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=862.12s)]
*  Do you think a pardon for his son would be a mistake? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=866.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes, and I don't think there's any chance [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=871.44s)]
*  that President Biden is going to do that, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=873.24s)]
*  unlike his predecessor, who pardoned all of his friends [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=875.44s)]
*  and anyone who had any access to him. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  What does that feel like? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=882.0400000000001s)]
*  Watching yourself back then reassuring people [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=883.92s)]
*  that Biden was not going to issue a pardon for his son. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=886.28s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that if that plea agreement [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=892.2s)]
*  and that plea deal had gone through, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=894.24s)]
*  there would be no pardon. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=896.96s)]
*  That was a satisfactory outcome. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=898.64s)]
*  It had already fallen through. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=900.72s)]
*  That only, sorry. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=901.56s)]
*  Well, when you reacted, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=906.4s)]
*  this was when the deal had fallen through. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=907.8s)]
*  Democrats have made liars out of the media [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=910.76s)]
*  and look what happened. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=913.3199999999999s)]
*  The Democrats are out of power [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=914.76s)]
*  and the media is out of viewers. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=916.12s)]
*  Democrat numbers guru, Nate Silver, is so angry, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=918.24s)]
*  he's telling Democrats to not vote for any Democrat [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=920.4s)]
*  in 2028 who doesn't repudiate the pardon within 48 hours. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=923.48s)]
*  But Eric Holder, Obama's wingman, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  says the pardon was warranted. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=930.8399999999999s)]
*  Had his name been Joe Smith, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=933.72s)]
*  it would have been a different story. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=935.8s)]
*  He's right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  If Hunter was Joe Smith, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=939.04s)]
*  he'd be in prison for drug possession, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=941.2s)]
*  sex trafficking, tax evasion, money laundering, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=943.12s)]
*  foreign lobbying, and probably wire fraud. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=945.84s)]
*  Joe Smith would have been in federal lockup [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=948.6s)]
*  sharing a cell with Mookie. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=950.6s)]
*  Anyway, we were told that a president [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  who pardons a family member is guilty of obstruction. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=954.88s)]
*  In the event the president pardons anyone [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=958.84s)]
*  in an investigation in which the president is a witness, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=961.2s)]
*  a subject or the target, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=965.2s)]
*  those investigative files will all be turned over [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  to the Congress. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=969.44s)]
*  The Congress ought to know whether the president [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=970.64s)]
*  is using the pardon power to obstruct justice. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=972.76s)]
*  The American people have a right to know. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=976.6s)]
*  I think it is clearly constitutional. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=979.08s)]
*  It doesn't prohibit him from granting a pardon, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=981.0s)]
*  even a pardon he shouldn't grant. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=983.6s)]
*  But it does say that we will be able to at least find out [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=985.72s)]
*  whether the president is using this power [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  to shield himself from liability. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=991.36s)]
*  Joe Biden, by pardoning Hunter, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=994.4s)]
*  was kind of pardoning himself. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=995.96s)]
*  But the media doesn't think Joe went far enough. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=998.32s)]
*  They want a pocket pardon. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1001.0s)]
*  I hope that President Biden will also issue [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1003.4000000000001s)]
*  preemptive pardons to all of those people threatened [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  by the injustice of what will become [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1010.88s)]
*  the Department of Justice in the Trump administration. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1013.6400000000001s)]
*  That of course includes Jack Smith and all of his staff, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  many Department of Justice lawyers. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1019.84s)]
*  It includes President Biden himself, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1021.8000000000001s)]
*  although we don't know that anyone [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1024.24s)]
*  can legally pardon themselves. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1025.96s)]
*  He will need a pardon because he is going to be harassed [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1028.44s)]
*  and charged for no crimes whatsoever. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1031.44s)]
*  Why would Joe need blanket pardons for himself and his son [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1035.08s)]
*  if he didn't do anything wrong? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1038.92s)]
*  If he didn't want Hunter to do prison time, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1040.96s)]
*  he could have just commuted his sentences and said [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1043.56s)]
*  he dished out blanket immunity, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1045.64s)]
*  absolving Hunter of all past and future sins. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1047.88s)]
*  The pardon dates back all the way to 2014. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1051.52s)]
*  Now what happened in 2014? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1055.56s)]
*  That's when Hunter joined Burisma, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1058.08s)]
*  and that's when Joe was handed the Ukraine portfolio. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  In a way, Trump was impeached for wanting to look [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1063.84s)]
*  into what Joe pardoned Hunter for. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1066.44s)]
*  And this pardon covers the Ukraine money, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1069.12s)]
*  the Russia money, the China money, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  oh, and the diamonds, the paintings, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1073.24s)]
*  and all those back taxes. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1074.56s)]
*  Gotta hand it to the big guy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1076.6s)]
*  He tied this operation up with a perfect bow. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  He had his son fly all over the world in his jet, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1081.36s)]
*  selling access to his dad, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1084.32s)]
*  hoovering up all the foreign cash all over the world, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1085.96s)]
*  not paying any taxes on it, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1088.92s)]
*  setting up shady shell companies to hide the money [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1091.28s)]
*  from the IRS, and then paying for the Biden family lifestyle, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  because none of the Biden family members [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1097.76s)]
*  could make a clean living on their own. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1099.36s)]
*  Then he got caught before an election. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1101.92s)]
*  The FBI and the CIA covered it up. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1103.68s)]
*  His son was found guilty, pardons him. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1106.3999999999999s)]
*  So the family gets to keep the cash, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1109.24s)]
*  and Hunter doesn't have to pay a price. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1110.96s)]
*  If you're running a criminal enterprise, it's brilliant. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1113.48s)]
*  Joe really pulled it off. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1116.68s)]

*  We believe Hunter Biden was an intelligence operation, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1121.3200000000002s)]
*  whether he even knew it or not. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1123.88s)]
*  He was going all over the world, selling access to his dad, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1126.04s)]
*  right under the nose of our intel agencies, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1128.88s)]
*  who had a clear view of who was dirty [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1131.52s)]
*  and who was being blackmailed. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1133.44s)]
*  Notice everyone around Hunter Biden's either in prison, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  awaiting sentencing, fled the country, or just disappeared. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1138.72s)]
*  Everyone Hunter was talking to was on FBI wiretap. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1142.2s)]
*  And every time someone sniffed around the Biden family, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1145.52s)]
*  they got blocked. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1148.56s)]
*  The IRS whistleblowers started looking into the big guy, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  blocked. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1153.0s)]
*  FBI informants ignored. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1154.24s)]
*  The Secret Service cleaned up all his messes. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  The DOJ tried to give him a sweetheart deal [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1159.44s)]
*  just before a judge smoked it out. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1162.04s)]
*  And when Congress wanted to talk to the sugar brother, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1164.52s)]
*  you know, the guy who paid millions out of pocket [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1166.64s)]
*  to cover Hunter's taxes, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1168.64s)]
*  the CIA told investigators, stand down. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  The sugar brother was untouchable. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  This pardon is the deep state's screw you [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1176.4799999999998s)]
*  before Trump returns. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1179.84s)]
*  Catch me if you can. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1182.04s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1185.1599999999999s)]
*  And tonight we begin with an important and virtuous message [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1186.0s)]
*  from the Democratic Party. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1189.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  This nation was founded on the principle [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  that there are no kings in America. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1195.32s)]
*  Each, each of us is equal before the law. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1197.8s)]
*  No one, no one is above the law. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1201.2s)]
*  The fact is no one is above the law. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1204.4s)]
*  In this country, no one is above the law. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1206.92s)]
*  The American principle that no one is above the law [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1210.52s)]
*  was reaffirmed. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1214.44s)]
*  Make no mistake, no one, not even the president [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1215.84s)]
*  of the United States is above the law. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1219.64s)]
*  In my administration, no one, in my administration, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1222.2s)]
*  no one is above the law. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1224.56s)]
*  Ah, nevermind, kidding as usual. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1227.36s)]
*  Now the Democrats you saw there, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1229.72s)]
*  they're just flat out lying. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1231.36s)]
*  In fact, there are people who are very clearly [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1232.92s)]
*  above the law, the ones that are lecturing all of you [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1235.84s)]
*  about the rule of law. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1239.0s)]
*  You know, and by the way, they are called the Biden family [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1240.68s)]
*  or as we affectionately refer to them on this program [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1243.16s)]
*  as simply the syndicate. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1246.16s)]
*  Early today, in a move that surprised no one [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1248.12s)]
*  who watches this channel, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1250.44s)]
*  President Biden did issue a full unconditional pardon [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1251.96s)]
*  to his beloved son Hunter, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1255.08s)]
*  only months after vowing over and over again [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1257.0s)]
*  that he would never pardon Hunter [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  because of his deep unwavering commitment to justice [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1262.04s)]
*  and the rule of law, you might recall. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1265.48s)]
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1268.6s)]
*  their verdict no matter what it is? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1271.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1272.9199999999998s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1274.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1276.32s)]
*  You have. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1277.28s)]
*  Does the president have any intention of pardoning him? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1278.12s)]
*  We've been asked that question multiple times. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1281.72s)]
*  Our answer stands, which is no. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1283.68s)]
*  Is there any possibility that the president [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1285.76s)]
*  would end up pardoning his son? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1288.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1289.88s)]
*  I just said no. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1291.72s)]
*  And I am satisfied that I'm not gonna do anything. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  I said I'd abide by the jury decision [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1297.24s)]
*  and I will do that and I will not pardon him. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1299.96s)]
*  I could speak for the president [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1302.44s)]
*  and he said he would not pardon his son [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1304.48s)]
*  and I'm just gonna leave it there. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1307.48s)]
*  You didn't take that seriously, did you? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1310.2s)]
*  That was before the election. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1311.76s)]
*  And like always, Biden, the entire White House, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1313.72s)]
*  they were lying to the American people. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1316.72s)]
*  According to NBC News, they knew that Biden [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  was planning a possible pardon, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1321.08s)]
*  but decided to tell the American people [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1322.96s)]
*  the exact opposite of what he was thinking. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  In a nutshell, is the Biden doctrine. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1327.52s)]
*  They just plain out blatantly lie about everything. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1330.0s)]
*  Remember, the border is closed, the border is secure. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1332.8s)]
*  Biden is running, he's running circles around his staff. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1335.72s)]
*  He's got so much energy. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  He's cognitively as sharp as ever, as he's ever been. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1340.48s)]
*  Inflation is transitory. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1344.92s)]
*  Trump, a threat to democracy [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1346.72s)]
*  and that he sponsored Project 2025 [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1348.92s)]
*  and wanted to ban abortion nationwide [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  and would sign that as president [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  and limit access to contraception [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1355.68s)]
*  and stop IVF treatments for women. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1357.92s)]
*  They said crime was down, lie, inflation was down, lie. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1360.4s)]
*  The withdrawal from Afghanistan went really, really well, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  if you believe them. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1366.52s)]
*  Nevermind what lies Kamala told. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1367.68s)]
*  Whoa, you know, would she have ever really closed the border? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1369.6799999999998s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1373.08s)]
*  Would she give taxpayer funded sex change operations [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  to illegals as she once said she would? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1377.28s)]
*  Probably. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1379.32s)]
*  Gender affirming care without parental consent? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1380.36s)]
*  Likely. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1382.9199999999998s)]
*  Ban fracking and drilling, which she said often. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1383.76s)]
*  I bet yes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1386.24s)]
*  Pack the US Supreme Court, eliminate the filibuster [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1387.4399999999998s)]
*  as she had promised. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1390.1999999999998s)]
*  Make DC, Puerto Rico a state. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1391.28s)]
*  Continue the weaponization of justice. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1393.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, we've all been subjected to one insane lie [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1396.1999999999998s)]
*  day after another that only a handful of remaining MS, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1400.24s)]
*  DNC, fake news, CNN viewers could or would believe. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1403.3600000000001s)]
*  So it is not a shocker that Joe Biden lied about a pardon [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1407.64s)]
*  for Hunter and keep in mind, this wasn't just a pardon [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1411.2800000000002s)]
*  for the felonies that Hunter was already convicted of. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1414.92s)]
*  No, this was a sweeping pardon that covers any [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1417.88s)]
*  and all federal crimes Hunter committed [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1421.68s)]
*  or may have committed. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1424.92s)]
*  The dates are important. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1426.72s)]
*  January 1st, 2014 and yesterday, December 1st, 2024. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1427.92s)]
*  In other words, Hunter Biden will face no consequences [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1432.52s)]
*  for any actions over the past 11 years. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1437.16s)]
*  Now that oddly specific timeline, how conveniently happens [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1439.8400000000001s)]
*  to coincide with the very same year that Hunter started [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1445.76s)]
*  raking in millions of dollars from Ukraine. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1449.72s)]
*  Remember he was on the border with Burisma, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1452.52s)]
*  no experience in energy, oil, gas, Ukraine, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  was getting paid millions. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1458.08s)]
*  But according to Joe, he never, I never once spoke [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1460.1599999999999s)]
*  to my son, my brother or anybody for that matter [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1463.6399999999999s)]
*  about their foreign business deals in spite of what looks [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  like evidence to the contrary, you know, pictures. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1469.76s)]
*  I guess he just, you know, pulled 2014 out of a hat. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1472.6s)]

*  Ukraine, remember he bragged about it, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1479.7199999999998s)]
*  about withholding billions in aid until they agreed [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1482.2s)]
*  to fire the prosecutor investigating his zero experience [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1485.0s)]

*  or the more likely scenario, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1492.1200000000001s)]
*  that was the real quid pro quo with Ukraine. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden was just lying through his teeth as always. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1496.0s)]
*  Think about this, 2014, that start date also happens [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1498.8400000000001s)]

*  money laundering, Farah violations [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1537.52s)]

*  that's around, you know, what 10% for the big guy [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1542.8s)]
*  or half my money goes to Pops, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1546.76s)]
*  but can the big guy sleep easy tonight? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1548.88s)]
*  That's a legal question. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  Is the Biden family syndicate officially in the clear? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1553.08s)]
*  What about all the money Hunter says he gave to Pops? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1556.96s)]
*  Half my income goes to Pops, it was on the laptop from hell. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1559.72s)]
*  Did other monies that he took in go to his brother? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1563.28s)]
*  Maybe wives involved, maybe ex-wives involved. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1568.16s)]

*  Did any money go to them? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1572.2s)]

*  Will Joe Biden in the end pardon himself? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1576.68s)]
*  As Politico put it, this 11 year pardon [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1579.48s)]
*  is quite possibly the most generous, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  extensive pardon in decades. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1584.64s)]
*  Now some democratic voters appear shocked and angry [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1586.88s)]
*  that Biden is in fact not a man of his word. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1589.48s)]
*  On ex, Nate Silver called Biden a quote, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1592.5600000000002s)]
*  selfish and senile old man [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1595.1599999999999s)]
*  who destroyed the democratic party. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1597.36s)]
*  Nate, why didn't you say all that ahead of time [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1599.6s)]
*  before the election? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, that may be true. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1604.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, here is another hard truth for my friends on the left. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1605.6399999999999s)]
*  The legacy media, so-called journalists [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1608.56s)]
*  that they respect and adore are brainless, spineless [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1611.7199999999998s)]
*  and nothing but shills for the democratic party. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1616.4399999999998s)]
*  And the polling, by the way, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1619.08s)]
*  that people like Nate Silver use from them [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  kind of sucked also. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1623.36s)]
*  They don't investigate big stories. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1625.48s)]
*  They don't look for the truth. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1626.3999999999999s)]
*  Instead, just look at the latest democratic talking point, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1627.8s)]
*  repeat that, regurgitate that, wash, rinse, repeat. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1631.08s)]
*  That's their formula. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1633.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's why Americans rejected them as well in November. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1635.04s)]
*  Now here, for example, is a sample [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1638.9599999999998s)]
*  of how they covered Biden's promise [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1641.1999999999998s)]
*  that he would never ever pardon Hunter. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1642.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1645.28s)]
*  A major commitment from the president, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1647.0s)]
*  accepting the outcome of the trial [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1649.28s)]
*  and also pledging not to pardon his son. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1651.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, the president has ruled out [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1653.68s)]
*  pardoning his son for those- [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1656.16s)]
*  I'll bet you a dollar. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1658.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1659.64s)]
*  And this week, of course, Hunter Biden was found guilty [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1660.48s)]
*  and Joe Biden has very clearly said [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1663.28s)]
*  he would not pardon his son, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  he would not commute his sentence. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1667.28s)]
*  Current president of the United States [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1668.8s)]
*  has so much respect for the law [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1671.8400000000001s)]
*  that he has said he would not pardon his son. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1674.24s)]
*  He is not pardoning his son, which he could do. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1676.8s)]
*  These are federal charges. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1681.04s)]
*  He is not doing that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1682.64s)]
*  He has a power for both of those. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1684.52s)]
*  He is not doing it because he is living what it means [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1686.3999999999999s)]
*  to have a rule of law in this country. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1690.2s)]
*  You think you'll ever trust the legacy media again, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1695.28s)]
*  these channels, but just, you know, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1697.44s)]
*  they just took Biden at his word and regurgitated it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1699.9199999999998s)]
*  Why would anyone in their right mind take Biden at his word? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1702.9199999999998s)]
*  We on this channel, on this show, we tell you the truth. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1706.44s)]
*  We've been right about Richard Jewell [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1709.28s)]

*  We were right about Freddie Gray in Baltimore. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1715.28s)]
*  We were right about Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1717.32s)]
*  We were right about Obama's radicalism. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1720.16s)]
*  We were right about vetting Kamala Harris, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1722.32s)]
*  which they wouldn't do. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1724.68s)]
*  We were right about Russia collusion. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1725.96s)]
*  We were right also about FISA abuse [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1727.64s)]
*  and I can keep going on and they're always wrong. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1729.68s)]
*  They peddle lies and conspiracy theories for a living. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1732.3600000000001s)]

*  and for the legacy media, it was all a means to the end. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  Support the Democratic Party, do it at all costs. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1744.8s)]
*  Thankfully, they no longer have influence [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1747.76s)]
*  over free thinking Americans that have, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1749.92s)]
*  in the beginning, they sought out talk radio. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1752.48s)]
*  They sought out Fox News. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1754.64s)]
*  Now they still trust talk radio, Fox News [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1756.28s)]
*  and they have social media. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1759.08s)]
*  Zeylon Musk said, we're all now in the media business [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1761.64s)]
*  and you can post things on your own [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1764.8s)]
*  and pass on information to your friends. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jm6GDnnlA&t=1766.68s)]
