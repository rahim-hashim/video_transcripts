# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 23, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingram Angle, and thank you, as always, for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2.84s)]
*  Trump zooms Davos. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=6.44s)]
*  The bond villain behind the elite's annual gathering in Davos is obviously nervous. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=11.0s)]
*  Klaus Schwab kicked off the annual confab by trying to reassure attendees that they still run the show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=18.0s)]
*  The world faces critical challenges, extreme weather events, misinformation and disinformation, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=24.64s)]
*  increasing divisions within societies, within countries. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=34.64s)]
*  The future is shaped by us, and particularly shaped by us here in this room. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=40.64s)]
*  Shaped by us in the room. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=47.64s)]
*  Warnings of disinformation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=51.64s)]
*  Can't make this up. This is the epitome of uninformed arrogance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=54.64s)]
*  But he's just another globalist mastodon on the verge of extinction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=60.64s)]
*  But still, let's compare the response to Trump at the World Economic Forum in his first term to how he was received today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=65.64s)]
*  It was quite something to behold. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=74.64s)]
*  Of course, I'm aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=76.64s)]
*  Therefore, it is so essential for us in the room to listen directly to you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=86.64s)]
*  The importance of American leadership and your personal leadership is fundamental and paramount. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=94.64s)]
*  We are here to hear your vision and policies related to revitalizing the economy and addressing the global challenges. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=102.64s)]
*  Well, so it goes from tolerating Trump at Davos, that first sound bite, to kind of, well, acknowledging grudgingly that he's a force to be reckoned with. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=113.64s)]
*  That's quite the change in tone. But this morning, Trump treated his Davos appearance kind of like a Zoom call with a message to Clueless Klaus. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=123.64s)]
*  I'm pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=132.64s)]
*  On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=137.64s)]
*  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=142.64s)]
*  which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and frankly progress. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=149.64s)]
*  It was so refreshing to watch from beginning to end. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=157.64s)]
*  It was Trump's message stood really in stark contrast to the Davos dimwits on almost every issue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=161.64s)]
*  And remember, they are not going to stop fighting as much as they can to destroy gas-powered cars, the entire oil and gas industry. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=167.64s)]
*  Our fossil fuel addiction is a Frankenstein monster, sparing nothing and no one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=176.64s)]
*  All around us, we see clear signs that the monster has become master. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=183.64s)]
*  Ooh, lofty rhetoric. But the real monster scenario is found in the world where they have all the power and individuals in free nations are forced to submit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=189.64s)]
*  While Trump's going to have none of that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=201.64s)]
*  I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=203.64s)]
*  I call it the Green New Scam, withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=208.64s)]
*  The United States is the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we're going to use it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=219.64s)]
*  Greenheads were exploding from the Swiss Alps to China. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=225.64s)]
*  Of course, China is banking on its ability to totally annihilate the American automobile industry by sucking us all into electric vehicles. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=230.64s)]
*  Now, on trade, Trump was just as blunt. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=241.64s)]
*  The EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=245.64s)]
*  They don't take our essentially don't take our farm products and they don't take our cars. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=249.64s)]
*  Yet they send cars to us by the millions. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=254.64s)]
*  They put tariffs on things that we want to do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=257.64s)]
*  We have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU and nobody's happy with it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=261.64s)]
*  And we're going to do something about it, but nobody's happy with it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=268.64s)]
*  Now, the agenda is now and always will be America first. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=271.64s)]
*  My message to every business in the world is very simple. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=276.64s)]
*  Come make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on earth. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=279.64s)]
*  But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=286.64s)]
*  But it wasn't just business issues tackled at Davos. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=294.64s)]
*  The gender benders, they're also panicking that they're losing power. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=298.64s)]
*  Now, who knew it was a global priority to protect drag shows? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=302.64s)]
*  What we've enacted is free speech for algorithms, not free speech for citizens. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=308.64s)]
*  We're seeing an uptick in violence in the United States against LGBTQ people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=313.64s)]
*  Everything from attacks at drag shows to trans women being murdered on the street. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=320.64s)]
*  And once again, Trump beamed in and laid waste to that insanity. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=327.64s)]
*  My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion nonsense. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=333.64s)]
*  America will once again become a merit based country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=341.64s)]
*  My favorite part, though, was when he chose to address the CEO of Bank of America directly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=348.64s)]
*  Now, remember, the bank had shared account holders information after January 6th and then flat out denied that other conservative businesses access to their services was even happening. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=355.64s)]
*  They thought, oh, no, everybody's getting access. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=366.64s)]
*  And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=369.64s)]
*  Of course, Bank of America claims nothing nefarious ever happened. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=380.64s)]
*  But the fact is the globalist titans of industry and politics and media, they gathered at Davos and they're never going to be comfortable with what Trump represents. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=385.64s)]
*  They might put on a good act, but never will they accept it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=396.64s)]
*  An America that is unapologetic, an America that is bold, an America that sometimes brash. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=400.64s)]
*  They don't want that, but too bad because Trump has all the momentum. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=407.64s)]
*  He returned from the political grave to win the presidency and he is inspiring not just our own citizens, but those seeking a better life across the globe. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=411.64s)]
*  Now, over the weekend, I had the chance to chat with Italian President Giorgia Maloney and watch the buzz around Argentina's reformer president Javier Malé. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=422.64s)]
*  I met populist politicians from Sweden, from Poland and the Czech Republic. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=431.64s)]
*  All of them, all of them are thrilled about our new American president. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=436.64s)]
*  So eight years ago, Trump was a speed bump on the way to global control. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=442.64s)]
*  Today, he's the prophet of pragmatism. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=447.64s)]
*  We all felt more connected than ever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=451.64s)]
*  We all feel more connected than ever, thanks in large part also to social media. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=454.64s)]
*  Think about it. What on earth would we do without Elon Musk and X? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=458.64s)]
*  Why do you think the Davos bigwigs are so keen on censorship? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=462.64s)]
*  Trump's Zoom message to all of them, all of them who thought America was on her heels, who profited off the decline of the American worker, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=467.64s)]
*  is clear. Your schemes to control us, to censor us, to rip us off, to shame us, are over. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=476.64s)]
*  You're officially on notice. And that's the angle. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=485.64s)]
*  Fox News alert. President Trump just signed an executive order, declassifying and releasing all files related to the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=494.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=505.64s)]
*  Lastly, sir, we have an executive order ordering the declassification of files relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=507.64s)]
*  That's a big one, huh? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=520.64s)]
*  A lot of people are waiting for this for a long, for years, for decades. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=522.64s)]
*  And everything will be revealed. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=528.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=535.64s)]
*  Give that to. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=540.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=543.64s)]
*  Only fair that Bobby gets the sharpie. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=548.64s)]
*  This order instructs the director of national intelligence and the attorney general to come up with a plan within 15 days for the full and complete release of the JFK files and 45 days for the release of the RFK and MLK archives. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=554.64s)]
*  These are tens of thousands of documents that have never been seen before that have been buried for over 60 years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=569.64s)]
*  Prime time will have full coverage on the day they drop 47 son to flurry of executive orders this afternoon and some of them could make you rich. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=575.64s)]
*  This is the crypto. We're going to be forming a internal working group to make crypto to make America the world capital and crypto under your leadership, which is really going up. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=584.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=595.64s)]
*  David, that's for you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=599.64s)]
*  You find them exciting. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=610.64s)]
*  They might not be except, but we're going to make a lot of money for the country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=612.64s)]
*  I don't own any crypto. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=615.64s)]
*  Should that change? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=617.64s)]
*  Trump says rates are coming down, whether Jerome knows it or not. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=619.64s)]
*  The interest rates will come down. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=623.64s)]
*  You said they demand that the interest rates come down. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=625.64s)]
*  Do you expect I would put in a strong statement. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=628.64s)]
*  Do you expect the fed to listen to you? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=631.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=634.64s)]
*  Trump's demystifying the idea that all these Washington institutions are perfectly independent. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=636.64s)]
*  Biden would never tell his attorney general what to do. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=642.64s)]
*  Obama would never talk to the Fed chair about rates. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=645.64s)]
*  I can't be seen talking to a justice that would be unethical. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=648.64s)]
*  The Washingtonian virtue signaling is history. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=652.64s)]
*  Presidents don't have to be shy about power. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=655.64s)]
*  And having an opinion isn't illegal anymore. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=658.64s)]
*  Trump's not whispering and tiptoeing around D.C. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=662.64s)]
*  Same thing with Davos. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=665.64s)]
*  Once a year, the financial elite gather in a tax haven, hire escorts and stroke each other's egos. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=667.64s)]
*  Then dictate how the rest of us are going to live. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=673.64s)]
*  Brain implants, bugs for dinner and willy nilly windmills. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=676.64s)]
*  Kerry's usually falling off his bicycle and Al Gore's screaming about rain bombs or misinformation. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=680.64s)]
*  This year, though, was a little different. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=687.64s)]
*  The newly minted president zoomed in as a symbol of disrespect and told Davos they aren't dictating anymore. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=689.64s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=697.64s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, class. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=710.64s)]
*  And hello to everyone in beautiful Davos. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=715.64s)]
*  This has been a truly historic week in the United States. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=718.64s)]
*  Three days ago, I took the oath of office and we began the Golden Age of America. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=722.64s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=729.64s)]
*  Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier and more united than ever before. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=737.64s)]
*  And the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we're doing and going to do. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=741.64s)]
*  Davos didn't usher in a golden age, did it? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=750.64s)]
*  Davos dictated DEI, mass migration and attacks on cow flatulence. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=753.64s)]
*  It isn't about what they want anymore. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=760.64s)]
*  It's about what we want. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=762.64s)]
*  And Trump's ripping up their wish list. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=764.64s)]
*  I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=767.64s)]
*  I call it the Green New Scam withdrew from the one sided Paris climate accord and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=773.64s)]
*  We're going to let people buy the car they want to buy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=783.64s)]
*  I mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=786.64s)]
*  It was conceived of by people that were average students, less than average students, I might add, and never even took a course in energy or the environment. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=789.64s)]
*  It was just a game. Remember the world was going to end in 12 years. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=800.64s)]
*  Remember that? Well, the 12 years has come and gone. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=804.64s)]
*  The new world order won't be set at a summit in Switzerland by bankers, politicians and economists who look like wooly mammoths. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=806.64s)]
*  At one point, Trump name checked the Bank of America CEO. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=814.64s)]
*  This CEO watch a speaking of you and you've done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=818.64s)]
*  And that included a place called Bank of America. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=831.64s)]
*  This conservative they don't take conservative business. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=834.64s)]
*  And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=836.64s)]
*  But you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=840.64s)]
*  President Trump calling a bank chairman immoral ruffled quite a few feathers in the Davos Donning Room, but they couldn't do anything about it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=847.64s)]
*  And neither can Canada. We're going to be demanding respect from other nations. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=855.64s)]
*  Canada, we have a tremendous deficit with Canada. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=862.64s)]
*  We're not going to have that anymore. We can't do it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=865.64s)]
*  It's I don't know if it's good for them. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=867.64s)]
*  As you probably know, I say you can always become a state man of your estate. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=870.64s)]
*  We won't have a deficit. We won't have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=874.64s)]
*  But Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=877.64s)]
*  And it's not fair that we should have a 200 billion or 250 billion dollar deficit. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=881.64s)]
*  We don't need them to make our cars and they make a lot of them. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=887.64s)]
*  We don't need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=890.64s)]
*  We don't need their oil and gas. We have our we have more than anybody. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=894.64s)]
*  America is beginning to reassert its economic advantage. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=898.64s)]
*  We have the biggest consumer market, more liquid capital than any country, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=901.64s)]
*  and the largest energy reserves, not to mention a bigger Navy than every nation on Earth [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=906.64s)]
*  and the dollars, the world currency. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=911.64s)]
*  So this country has an absolute right, an obligation to our own people [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=913.64s)]
*  to set trade terms and not be taken advantage of. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=919.64s)]
*  NATO's spending, a perfect example. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=922.64s)]
*  I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to five percent of GDP, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=926.64s)]
*  which is what it should have been years ago. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=932.64s)]
*  It was only at two percent and most nations didn't pay until I came along. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=935.64s)]
*  I insisted that they pay and they did because the United States was really paying the difference at that time. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=939.64s)]
*  And it was unfair to the United States. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=945.64s)]
*  Why aren't the Europeans paying more for their own protection? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=948.64s)]
*  Why are we paying the bulk of NATO's budget? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=951.64s)]
*  That's like a security guard paying a client to protect them. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=954.64s)]
*  NATO is an incredible alliance. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=957.64s)]
*  We just have to get our books in order so our allies don't get a free ride, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=960.64s)]
*  because while they get a free ride on defense, they're ripping us off on trade. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=964.64s)]
*  They tariff American goods, but we barely tariff European goods. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=969.64s)]
*  And that's about to change. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=973.64s)]
*  And the Saudis better start pumping. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=975.64s)]
*  Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=979.64s)]
*  but I'll be asking the Crown Prince, who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=984.64s)]
*  I think they'll do that because we've been very good to them. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=989.64s)]
*  And I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=993.64s)]
*  And if the Saudis don't round up $400 billion, Trump will visit Israel first. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=998.64s)]
*  Would that be the first foreign country you'll visit since they invested that much money? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1008.64s)]
*  Well, if they do that, I would be glad to do that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1012.64s)]
*  I did it, as you know, four years ago. We did $450 billion, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1015.64s)]
*  meaning the money all goes to American companies, and they purchase jets, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1019.64s)]
*  and they purchase computers and everything else. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  And we did $450 billion, and I guess we're at $600 billion, $650 billion. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  Trump's shopping around his first foreign trip to the highest bidder. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1033.64s)]
*  And it's not like he's getting the money, you're getting the money. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1037.64s)]
*  These are investments in America. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1040.64s)]
*  Trump's treating our country like an NFL free agent. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1043.64s)]
*  You know, I really want to sign with Buffalo, but L.A.'s offering a much better package. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1046.64s)]
*  Globalism's over, and we're taking Davos down with it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1052.64s)]
*  We're not going to let multinationals outsource production [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1056.64s)]
*  and sell product back into the U.S. duty-free. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1059.64s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and supply chains. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1062.64s)]
*  Fiat Chrysler met with Trump, and now they're restarting a Jeep plant in Illinois [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1065.64s)]
*  and building Dodge Durangos in Detroit. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1070.64s)]
*  Samsung is about to move production from Mexico into the United States. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1073.64s)]
*  Canada wants to help Trump restart the Keystone pipeline. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1077.64s)]
*  And the president just lifted a pause on liquefied natural gas exports [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1081.64s)]
*  so we can sell the Europeans natural gas and wean them off Russian energy, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1086.64s)]
*  which makes our country wealthier, our allies safer, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1090.64s)]
*  and slows down the Russian war machine, forcing Putin to the negotiating table. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1093.64s)]
*  And by the way, check your 401K. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1098.64s)]
*  The S&P 500 just hit a fresh record high. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1101.64s)]
*  And guess where Marco Rubio's first trip is as secretary of state? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1105.64s)]
*  Panama. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1110.64s)]
*  What a powerful message to send. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1112.64s)]
*  Things are moving again, and the administration's in the zone. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1114.64s)]
*  At any point, did you doubt you would be back here? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1119.64s)]
*  So it's a great question. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1124.64s)]
*  It's something I don't think about. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1127.64s)]
*  I never really thought about it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1128.64s)]
*  I don't think about, gee, will I be back? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1130.64s)]
*  I just do it. I get it done. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1132.64s)]
*  I get things done. I'm good at getting things done. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1134.64s)]
*  Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley says Trump's not making surgical strikes, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1137.64s)]
*  but saturation bombing Washington. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1143.64s)]
*  Obama promised to fundamentally transform America, but Trump is actually doing it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1145.64s)]
*  There was this myth that there was gridlock in Washington. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1150.64s)]
*  The country was divided and change was slow. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1154.64s)]
*  That just gave professional politicians an excuse for three-day work weeks. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1157.64s)]
*  They didn't want you to know real change was possible, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1162.64s)]
*  because then we'd raise expectations and they'd have to actually do their jobs [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1165.64s)]
*  and actually represent our interests instead of their own. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1169.64s)]
*  But now they have an excuse for their lack of action. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1173.64s)]
*  The New York Times says it's the return of the king. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1176.64s)]
*  Trump embraces trappings of the throne. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1180.64s)]
*  The media wants you to think only a tyrant could get things done in D.C. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1183.64s)]
*  They want you to think what Trump's doing is not in the American tradition. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1188.64s)]
*  He's a wannabe dictator. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1193.64s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1195.64s)]
*  Just because he's playing with a sword doesn't make him Napoleon. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1197.64s)]
*  This is what it looks like when you beat four cases, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1201.64s)]
*  survive two assassination attempts, and sweep every battleground. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1205.64s)]
*  A president with political capital who knows how to use it with gusto and precision. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1209.64s)]
*  Lawyer Mike Davis told the New York Times, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1215.64s)]
*  Democrat presidents use their power to put foreign nationals on welfare, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1231.64s)]
*  bribe voters with college loan bailouts, and print money to dish out to donors. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1235.64s)]
*  Democrats did all of that after their elections. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1240.64s)]
*  They never campaigned on any of that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1243.64s)]
*  They tried to hide it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1245.64s)]
*  The difference is Trump's doing exactly what he promised to do, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1247.64s)]
*  and the voters ratified the mission. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1251.64s)]
*  We're living in a time of populist rebellion. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1254.64s)]
*  Journalist Carl Zinsmeister says this. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1257.64s)]
*  Maybe their sky's falling. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1272.64s)]
*  Maybe their time at the top's over, but yours isn't. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1273.64s)]
*  Your time at the top is just getting started. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1276.64s)]
*  The power's being returned to the people. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1279.64s)]
*  No one can tell you what bank to use, what car to buy, what words to say, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1282.64s)]
*  what food to eat, which shows to watch. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1285.64s)]
*  We're the only ones who can get in our own way. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1289.64s)]
*  So put your chin up and your shoulders back. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1292.64s)]
*  Today was a good day. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1295.64s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity, and tonight, part two of my Oval Office interview [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1297.64s)]
*  with the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1300.64s)]
*  That's only moments away. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1303.64s)]
*  We talk about tax cuts, Putin, Ukraine, China, President Xi, North Korea, Iran, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1305.64s)]
*  so much more. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1310.64s)]
*  Also breaking tonight, Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1312.64s)]
*  has officially cleared his procedural vote in the Senate. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1316.64s)]
*  We'll now advance to a confirmation vote, likely around this time tomorrow night. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1320.64s)]
*  If you are counting, it is only day four of the new Trump administration. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1325.64s)]
*  The activity level is off the charts. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1329.64s)]
*  The president dialed in. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1332.64s)]
*  He is executing his agenda at a lightning-fast pace. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1334.64s)]
*  Now, here's something we rarely see in American politics. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1338.64s)]
*  President Trump is actually keeping his campaign promises, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1341.64s)]
*  and he's doing them as quickly as possible. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1346.64s)]
*  Breaking tonight, the president signed a new order to declassify [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1348.64s)]
*  the JFK, RFK, MLK assassination files without delay. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1353.64s)]
*  As promised, the president is committed to government transparency. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1358.64s)]
*  He's also committed to securing our borders. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1362.64s)]
*  Look at this headline. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1365.64s)]
*  Quote, border encounters drop sharply as Trump launches crackdown [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1366.64s)]
*  on illegal immigration. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1371.64s)]
*  I think he said he was going to do that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1373.64s)]
*  Now, of course, that crackdown does include deportations. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1375.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1378.64s)]
*  I'm not going back to Haiti. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1379.64s)]
*  One of those threats is this illegal alien from Haiti. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1381.64s)]
*  ICE says he's a gang member with 17 criminal convictions in recent years. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1384.64s)]
*  You feel me? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1389.64s)]
*  Yo, Biden forever, bro. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1391.64s)]
*  Thank Obama for everything that he said for me, bro. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1393.64s)]
*  I think he's going back to Haiti. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1396.64s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump has empowered immigration and customs enforcement [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1398.64s)]
*  to do their job in all 50 states, yep, even sanctuary states and cities. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1401.64s)]
*  He also declared a national emergency at the border. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1406.64s)]
*  He's deployed U.S. Marines to the region. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1410.64s)]
*  He has now reinstituted the stay-at-Mexico policy [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1412.64s)]
*  for so-called asylum seekers. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1415.64s)]
*  And Donald Trump also pressuring Mexico to secure their own [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1418.64s)]
*  southern border and, by the way, close the newly renamed Gulf of America. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1422.64s)]
*  The president also making good on his promise to demolish globalism. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1427.64s)]
*  He has already removed the U.S. from the destructive Paris Climate Accords. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1432.64s)]
*  Those accords say China and India are developing nations. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1437.64s)]
*  He also withdrew our country from the horrendous global minimum tax, the WHO. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1441.64s)]
*  He's again moving at lightning speed. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1447.64s)]
*  We saw Donald Trump today during his speech in front of the World Economic Forum [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1450.64s)]
*  in Davos, Switzerland, while the president vowed to always put America first, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1454.64s)]
*  and he delivered a powerful blow to the censorship-loving elites. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1459.64s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1464.64s)]
*  I'm pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1466.64s)]
*  On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1470.64s)]
*  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1474.64s)]
*  as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1478.64s)]
*  and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1484.64s)]
*  We have saved free speech in America, and we've saved it strongly. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1489.64s)]
*  Now, the president, he also used that speech to call out someone sitting in the very room in Davos, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1495.64s)]
*  Bank of America's CEO, according to a 15-state coalition, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1502.64s)]
*  the Bank of America has discriminated against Americans for political and religious reasons. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1507.64s)]
*  The attorney general of Virginia also accused the bank of, quote, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1513.64s)]
*  voluntarily cooperating with the FBI. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1517.64s)]
*  The U.S. Treasury, under Biden, to profile conservative and religious Americans [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1519.64s)]
*  as potential domestic terrorists. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1524.64s)]
*  And here is what President Trump had to say to the bank's CEO. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1527.64s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1530.64s)]
*  By the way, speaking of you, and you've done a fantastic job, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1532.64s)]
*  but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1535.64s)]
*  because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1538.64s)]
*  and that included a place called Bank of America. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1544.64s)]
*  They don't take conservative business, and I don't know if the regulators mandated that [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1547.64s)]
*  because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1552.64s)]
*  I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you're doing is wrong. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1556.64s)]
*  Now, Bank of America's CEO did not respond at the event, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1560.64s)]
*  but the bank later issued a statement denying that they have a political litmus test [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1563.64s)]
*  despite multiple serious allegations. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1568.64s)]
*  Now, the president is not going to play nice after years of political rot. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1571.64s)]
*  He's going to stand up to anyone. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1575.64s)]
*  He will hold them accountable in front of the entire world, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1577.64s)]
*  and that includes America's deep state spy apparatus. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1580.64s)]
*  Now, after meddling in the 2020 election with that deceptive letter [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1584.64s)]
*  suggesting that the very real and true Hunter Biden laptop story was likely Russian disinformation, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1588.64s)]
*  remember, 51 former intel officials, well, they have now been stripped of their security clearance, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1595.64s)]
*  and that includes a notorious liar, former Marxist John Brennan, who is still lying, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1601.64s)]
*  and by the way, very sad, he will no longer be able to abuse that special access. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1607.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1612.64s)]
*  As you point out, he misrepresented the facts in that executive order, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1613.64s)]
*  because it said that we had suggested that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1616.64s)]
*  No, we said it was for the hallmarks of Russian information operations, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1621.64s)]
*  including the dumping of accurate information, which is what we said in that letter. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1626.64s)]
*  Right where he belongs, over there at the conspiracy peddling MSDNC. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1630.64s)]
*  Frankly, he's just lying. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1636.64s)]
*  Look at this old headline from The Guardian, quote, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1638.64s)]
*  John Brennan, lie to you and to the Senate. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1640.64s)]
*  Fire him. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1643.64s)]
*  As you can see, Brennan has long been accused of leaking classified information, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1644.64s)]
*  lying to Congress, spreading baseless smears on MSDNC, but not anymore. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1649.64s)]
*  President Trump is actually draining the swamp, as promised. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1655.64s)]
*  He's firing political hacks. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1658.64s)]
*  He is forcing bureaucrats back to the office five days a week. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1660.64s)]
*  He is pausing all federal regulation. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1664.64s)]
*  He is getting rid of all the DEI programs and employees. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1667.64s)]
*  Our country is now positioned to make the greatest comeback ever seen. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1671.64s)]
*  Trump is calling it a new golden age in America. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1676.64s)]
*  We talked about this and so much more yesterday in the Oval Office. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1679.64s)]
*  Here is part two of my interview with the president. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1683.64s)]
*  Today's liberal parents are suddenly realizing their offsprings have minds of their own. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1686.64s)]
*  And even with Xanax and boxed wine, it's a bitch. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1692.64s)]
*  Take last Sunday's New York Times fretful article titled, When Your Son Goes MAGA. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1696.64s)]
*  One mom laments that her 20-year-old son, Eli, is generous and thoughtful, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1702.64s)]
*  but he also voted for Donald Trump. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1707.64s)]
*  Because, you know, he can't be both. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1709.64s)]
*  Eli's mom hates his MAGA hat, and they argue about guns and immigration, even abortion. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1711.64s)]
*  A mom arguing with her son about abortion, that's got to make the kid feel great. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1717.64s)]
*  It's like a mechanic saying, you're lucky I didn't cut your brakes. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1723.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, other parents blamed it on social media. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1728.64s)]
*  Said one mom, I was like, who got a hold of my son? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1731.64s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure who got a hold of your son, but be relieved it wasn't this guy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1735.64s)]
*  Or even this guy. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1741.64s)]
*  So maybe mom, he's just learning to think for himself. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1745.64s)]
*  He's becoming that independent person you claim to want. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1749.64s)]
*  But the culture has been turned so upside down by progressives like yourself [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1752.64s)]
*  that independent thought seems alien to you. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1756.64s)]
*  His rebellion is necessary thanks to you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1759.64s)]
*  And he's the kind of young voter Trump reached out to in 2024. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1763.64s)]
*  While Kamala was clucking along with the gassy hens on The View, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1766.64s)]
*  Trump was on podcasts reaching kids who were curious about this creature [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1770.64s)]
*  that seems to get under every adult's skin. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1775.64s)]
*  And he showed he wasn't Hitler, Stalin, or even Kilmeade. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1779.64s)]
*  He was clear, funny, even real. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1784.64s)]
*  The opposite of their parents' preference, demented and drunken. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1787.64s)]
*  So now college campuses are becoming safe places for Republicans. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1792.64s)]
*  Hell, coeds now have shirtless posters of Mitch McConnell on their wall. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1795.64s)]
*  But we saw this coming. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1803.64s)]
*  The lack of authority on independent minds always causes them to rebel [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1805.64s)]
*  when the beliefs adults espouse are expressed without persuasion. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1810.64s)]
*  Telling your kid to make their bed or go to church without explaining why, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1815.64s)]
*  they're not going to listen. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1818.64s)]
*  And once they can break free from your hectoring, they embrace what you reject. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1820.64s)]
*  It's like those kids you knew who lived under a strict household, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1824.64s)]
*  then they went away to college and became drunken, drugged out idiots. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1827.64s)]
*  Why I ended up with a Bob Crane tattoo? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1832.64s)]
*  So these parents assumed they could just say Trump is evil and that would suffice. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1837.64s)]
*  Sure, you can tell your kid sex is just a construct, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1842.64s)]
*  but then they look down and see, no, that's not a vagina. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1845.64s)]
*  Even the Times' own premise explains why they lost. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1853.64s)]
*  Asking how do parents deal with these kids? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1857.64s)]
*  It should have been how do these kids deal with teachers who mock them simply [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1860.64s)]
*  for asking, why is Trump so bad? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1864.64s)]
*  It's no different than the shows on late night. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1867.64s)]
*  They demand allegiance to their mundane, predictable and lazy assumptions, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1869.64s)]
*  and the smart viewers say goodbye, and they come over here. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1874.64s)]
*  You know, I hate to pat myself on the back, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1878.64s)]
*  but among those crappy late night shows, I was the Alex P. Keaton. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1881.64s)]
*  Oh, thank you. No need. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1887.64s)]
*  But instead of family ties, it was back to the future, and the future was great. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1890.64s)]
*  You just didn't know it yet. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1895.64s)]
*  Let's welcome Terri Davis! [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1897.64s)]
*  In just five short years, he'll be allowed near schools again. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1901.64s)]
*  Comedian, host of the Jim Norton Can't Save You podcast, Jim Norton. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1906.64s)]
*  When she calls the fight, she's the knockout. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1913.64s)]
*  Host of Outkick the Morning, Charlie Arnone. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1916.64s)]
*  She won't stop till she's ready to drop. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1921.64s)]
*  New York Times best-selling author, New York Times contributor, Kat Jib. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1924.64s)]
*  And he's not allowed to go horseback riding. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1929.64s)]
*  New York Times best-selling author, comedian, and former head of the way, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1931.64s)]
*  and champion, Roger Manning. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1934.64s)]
*  Jim, a lot of people aren't aware that you're a nationally renowned parenting expert. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1939.64s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1944.64s)]
*  Which is odd, because you don't have any kids. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1945.64s)]
*  Yes, and I'm not allowed near schools. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1947.64s)]
*  Yes. But you had parents. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1949.64s)]
*  I did. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1951.64s)]
*  So, did a lot of your behavior, was it contingent on the things they told you not to do? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1952.64s)]
*  You know, I always pushed back. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1958.64s)]
*  Like, it was, I didn't want to get in the family business. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1960.64s)]
*  Like, I wanted to kind of do my own thing. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1963.64s)]
*  What was your family business? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1965.64s)]
*  My parents mule heroin. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1967.64s)]
*  And I can see. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1970.64s)]
*  I just didn't want to swallow the little balloons. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1972.64s)]
*  It's not healthy. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1974.64s)]
*  I went with the ten pound bales of marijuana. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1976.64s)]
*  And I would soak them in castor oil. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1979.64s)]
*  And a friend would help me get them in with a croquet mallet. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1982.64s)]
*  I don't remember the question. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1990.64s)]
*  You were asking about my relationship with my folks. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1992.64s)]
*  But they were always pretty independent. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1994.64s)]
*  They didn't obsess about politics. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1997.64s)]
*  Any parent that obsesses about politics, you're just a bore. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=1999.64s)]
*  You're just a bore. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2002.64s)]
*  And it's just the natural inclination of somebody younger just to go, shut up. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2004.64s)]
*  They don't want to hear it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2007.64s)]
*  If you encourage someone just to be an open-minded and a free thinker, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2009.64s)]
*  they might go the way you want them to go. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2012.64s)]
*  But these parents are not upset that their kids went for Trump. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2014.64s)]
*  They're upset that, like, they're narcissists. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2017.64s)]
*  And they're like, why couldn't I create a clone of my own belief system? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2019.64s)]
*  So, they're just, it's about their own narcissism. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2023.64s)]
*  It's not about their kid, and they're disappointed. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2026.64s)]
*  That is a great point. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2028.64s)]
*  It is, I think, Charlie, about compliance. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2029.64s)]
*  They just wanted you to comply. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2032.64s)]
*  Be like me so I can look at you and go, there's me. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2034.64s)]
*  I made you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2037.64s)]
*  But then what does that say about the parents? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2039.64s)]
*  Because we know what the, well, what they, I guess, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2041.64s)]
*  what liberal children are doing on college campuses these days. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2043.64s)]
*  They're joining the girls' sports teams if they're boys. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2046.64s)]
*  So, I mean, does that reflect on the parents? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2048.6400000000003s)]
*  They're attending the pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2050.6400000000003s)]
*  They're on their 18th booster shot. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2052.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, if that reflects the parents, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2055.6400000000003s)]
*  I can't really say too many positive things about the parents. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2057.64s)]
*  I just, you know, when I read these articles, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2059.64s)]
*  it's like you said, their kid could be perfect in all ways, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2062.64s)]
*  except if they vote for Donald Trump, they're immediately a monster. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2066.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be thoughtful and a Trump supporter. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2069.64s)]
*  Right, and that's why their brains are broken, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2071.64s)]
*  because anything related to conservatism in their minds is inherently evil. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2073.64s)]
*  But it's these kids that have gone through so many things [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2076.64s)]
*  that they probably can't even have their parents even begin to understand. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2079.64s)]
*  Do you get along with your parents politically? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2082.64s)]
*  No. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2085.64s)]
*  I do. No, I do. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2086.64s)]
*  I just, I have uncovered a few things about certain of my family members recently [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2088.64s)]
*  that I'm very upset about, and it's led to some very intense conversations. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2093.64s)]
*  But, yes, I get along very well with my parents. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2097.64s)]
*  Oh. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2099.64s)]
*  You know, Kat, you were different from your late mother. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2100.64s)]
*  Did she care what direction you went in? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2104.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2108.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2109.64s)]
*  I wrote about this in excruciating detail in my book, actually, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2110.64s)]
*  because it was a huge issue between us that she was very, very religious, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2112.64s)]
*  and I'm not as much as I would like to be. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2116.64s)]
*  I think I'd be happier if I were. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2118.64s)]
*  But she, you know, yeah, but I understand her perspective, right? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2120.64s)]
*  Because if she believes that I'm going to hell, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2124.64s)]
*  I can understand why she just couldn't let that go. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2126.64s)]
*  See, that makes sense. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2128.64s)]
*  Politically, it's weird. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2130.64s)]
*  If you vote for Trump, are you going to hell? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2132.64s)]
*  That's not the question. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2135.64s)]
*  That's the thing, and in this article that I read, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2137.64s)]
*  they said that they were having a hard time talking about these political issues [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2139.64s)]
*  without permanently damaging the relationship. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2143.64s)]
*  It's like, you guys, you've got to get over yourselves. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2146.64s)]
*  Truly, it's insane. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2149.64s)]
*  I mean, you've got to just look at Trump and Obama [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2150.64s)]
*  laughing together at Jimmy Carter's funeral, okay? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2153.64s)]
*  Politics, you are pathetic and weird if you are letting it interfere [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2156.64s)]
*  with your relationship with your children on behalf of these people [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2160.64s)]
*  that don't even care that you exist. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2163.64s)]
*  I hope that my kid will, you know, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2166.64s)]
*  respect people who believe differently, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2170.64s)]
*  but it's okay if my kid believes differently than I do. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2172.64s)]
*  That's not the stuff I worry about. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2174.64s)]
*  I worry that my kid's going to be, like, a bad hang. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2176.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2178.64s)]
*  You know? Like, the kid shows up, and people are like, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2180.64s)]
*  ugh, so-and-so's here. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2182.64s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2184.64s)]
*  That's what I... because you can't really control it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2186.64s)]
*  Your kids are going to be who they're going to be. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2188.64s)]
*  I have the same personality as my mom did, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2190.64s)]
*  but we have different values. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2192.64s)]
*  All my siblings and I are very different. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2194.64s)]
*  You don't know what you're going to get. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2196.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know what you're saying? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2198.64s)]
*  It's not that you don't want to love your kid, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2200.64s)]
*  you want to like the kid. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2202.64s)]
*  You want to go like, okay, I like this kid, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2204.64s)]
*  because loving means you don't have to like them. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2206.64s)]
*  Right. You don't want to be, like, humiliated to bring them places. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2208.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2210.64s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2212.64s)]
*  Boy, are you in for a show. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2214.64s)]
*  You know what, though, Tyra, so... [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2216.64s)]
*  It's not really about parents. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2218.64s)]
*  It's about a whole... [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2220.64s)]
*  whole bunch of people around you [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2222.64s)]
*  who demanded that you agree. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2224.64s)]
*  And yet, when they demand you... [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2226.64s)]
*  for you to agree, they actually don't [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2228.64s)]
*  take the effort to [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2230.64s)]
*  persuade you to agree. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2232.64s)]
*  Well, I disagree a little bit [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2234.64s)]
*  because in my house, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2236.64s)]
*  it was different. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2238.64s)]
*  Children, I guess me, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2240.64s)]
*  weren't allowed at the dinner table [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2242.64s)]
*  during conversations of politics. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2244.64s)]
*  The best I could ever understand [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2246.64s)]
*  of what happened in an election night [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2248.64s)]
*  was, oh, that... [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2250.64s)]
*  guy, and that was it for my bedroom. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2252.64s)]
*  You're like, I don't know, the... [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2254.64s)]
*  guy won. I'm not sure who. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2256.64s)]
*  We weren't... It was just something that... [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2258.64s)]
*  that you weren't allowed [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2260.64s)]
*  to talk about it because you didn't know [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2262.64s)]
*  about it. That's what you're... Go learn about it in history. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2264.64s)]
*  And I kind of [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2266.64s)]
*  have done the same thing with my kids, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2268.64s)]
*  but unfortunately, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2270.64s)]
*  my daughter met President Trump. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2272.64s)]
*  So she became a Trumper because [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2274.64s)]
*  she met him, and he was nicer, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2276.64s)]
*  and they talked. And so [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2278.64s)]
*  when TV would come on, and Kamala [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2280.64s)]
*  would speak, I would hear, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2282.64s)]
*  this... guy? And I would go... [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2284.64s)]
*  And she was like, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2286.64s)]
*  she doesn't talk very good. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2288.64s)]
*  How can anyone vote for her? Anyone who [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2290.64s)]
*  votes for her is an idiot. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2292.64s)]
*  Trump has good sentences. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2294.64s)]
*  And I was like, that is right. And why are you [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2296.64s)]
*  voting for him on? His vocabulary, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2298.64s)]
*  and he always wears a suit. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2300.64s)]
*  I respect a man in a suit. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2302.64s)]
*  She's 10. And why [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2304.64s)]
*  won't you vote for Kamala? Because she [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2306.64s)]
*  talks like she's 4. And I hate [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2308.64s)]
*  babies. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2310.64s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2312.64s)]
*  A beautiful, heartwarming tale. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2314.64s)]
*  I'm looking forward to your next children's book, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2316.64s)]
*  Jim. Yes. Do you have a title for it [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2318.64s)]
*  yet? Yes, it's called This Whole Thing's a Misunderstanding. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2320.64s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oH73jwTVcs&t=2336.64s)]
