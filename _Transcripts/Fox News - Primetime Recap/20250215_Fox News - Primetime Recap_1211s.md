# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 14, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q)
*  All right, this is a serious question on a Friday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Are there any sane Democrats left in Washington? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=3.84s)]
*  Do any of them care about the billions being stolen [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=8.08s)]
*  from the U.S. taxpayers? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=12.48s)]
*  Stolen through waste, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  stolen through negligence, fraud, abuse? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=16.16s)]
*  Now, presumably their constituents, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=19.2s)]
*  I don't care what party registration they have, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=21.88s)]
*  are not happy that their hard-earned money [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=24.88s)]
*  is being flushed down the toilet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=27.64s)]
*  Well, today Doge announced that it was saving Americans [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=29.92s)]
*  $115 million after canceling 167 contracts, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=32.72s)]
*  including a 2.3 million contract [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  for quote, equity assessments [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=41.36s)]
*  of existing program policies at HHS. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=43.72s)]
*  Now, over at the Department of Education, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=46.84s)]
*  there are more equity scams [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=49.7s)]
*  robbing the taxpayers of money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  And they're being zeroed out with Doge noting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=53.34s)]
*  that the Department of Education terminated grants [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=55.24s)]
*  to the four equity assistance centers there, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=58.32s)]
*  totaling 33 million. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=60.88s)]
*  And this is my favorite, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=62.72s)]
*  and it included a workshop titled, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=63.56s)]
*  Identifying and Disrupting Your Whiteness [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=65.92s)]
*  by quote, addressing power and privilege [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=70.28s)]
*  toward anti-racist spaces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=73.02s)]
*  Now, remember Biden's team, they love the word equity. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=76.76s)]
*  They can make it mean anything they wanted, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=80.28s)]
*  And they were obsessed with race [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=82.92s)]
*  and anti-racism fraudsters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=85.88s)]
*  Basically making them rich. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=87.96s)]
*  And those people cashed in huge post George Floyd. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=89.36s)]
*  Of course, these efforts did nothing to help black America, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=93.28s)]
*  but it did make the Hucksters rich and briefly famous. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=96.44s)]
*  Now, after Trump won, after he improved his standing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=101.0s)]
*  among black men, Latinos, young people, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  do Democrats really think that defending this stuff [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=108.44s)]
*  is really a path to victory for them? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=113.02s)]
*  What's their evidence for thinking that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=115.16s)]
*  What's their justification for believing that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=118.16s)]
*  The management of your money already identified by Doge [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=120.28s)]
*  is staggeringly bad. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=123.52s)]
*  It's indefensible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=126.2s)]
*  And it's only, I fear, the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=128.52s)]
*  We learned a little bit more just a few hours ago. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=131.08s)]
*  We'll get to it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=133.12s)]
*  Now Trump's new EPA administrator has only been on the job [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=134.4s)]
*  for what, less than three weeks, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=137.44s)]
*  but he's already found waste in the billions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=138.52s)]
*  Roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=142.9s)]
*  were parked at an outside financial institution [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=146.28s)]
*  by the Biden EPA. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=148.92s)]
*  This pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=150.12s)]
*  The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=154.68s)]
*  to far left activist groups in the name [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=158.66s)]
*  of environmental justice and climate equity are over. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=160.68s)]
*  Again, equity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=164.36s)]
*  Every time you hear that, watch your wallet. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=165.44s)]
*  Now, when we're 36 trillion in debt, is that right now? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=167.96s)]
*  When we spend more than a trillion dollars a year [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=171.82s)]
*  just on our interest payments on that debt, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=174.72s)]
*  how do Democrats justify any of this spending? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=178.28s)]
*  Well, to answer this, they don't really even try, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=181.96s)]
*  but what they do do is they attack the messenger. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=185.34s)]
*  We're not just going to fight this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=188.72s)]
*  We're going to fight this with everything we got. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=190.68s)]
*  Let's make sure that unelected, felon mosque, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=193.52s)]
*  because you can't spell felon without Elon, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=197.8s)]
*  understand that the criminality [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  that they think they're getting away with, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  they will not get away with. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Get your musty hands off of our money. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=207.92s)]
*  I'll put a mask down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=210.76s)]
*  You muster moomoo moomoo. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=212.56s)]
*  Still trying to understand the moomoo musk, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  still trying to get that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  So how is that, how's that possibly the future [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=219.64s)]
*  for the Democrat party? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Has the entire party been captured [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  by left-wing reactionaries like we just heard? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=227.12s)]
*  I'd like to ask the Federal Reserve Chairman that question [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=230.04s)]
*  after he was confronted by them this week. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=234.28s)]
*  When Musk comes knocking at the Fed's door, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  are you going to let him in? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't have anything for you on that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=242.2s)]
*  Would you like to tell us today [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=246.28s)]
*  that you won't let Doge into the Federal Reserve [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  or have access to the systems and the data? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  So we don't, I don't have any, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  we've had no contact and I don't really have, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=257.6s)]
*  I have nothing for you to report today on that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=261.0s)]
*  Well, you know what happened at Treasury [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=263.64s)]
*  and you know what happened over at the CFPB [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=265.4s)]
*  and the people of this country are being violated [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=267.88s)]
*  because all of our privacy is being taken up [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=270.68s)]
*  by Elon Musk and Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=274.04s)]
*  and we don't know what all they have on us. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=276.92s)]
*  Okay, he's thinking to himself, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=280.64s)]
*  I'd rather have permanent inflation blamed on me [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=281.76s)]
*  and a root canal rather than sitting across [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  from that woman, anything. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=287.04s)]
*  Again, why don't the Democrats care about the waste? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=289.8s)]
*  Nobody keep asking this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't have a good answer. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=294.8s)]
*  Could there be the argument that you might be missing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=297.48s)]
*  the will of the voters who support Doge [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  and might be too hung up on the process? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  The American people are alarmed about the possibility [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=306.48s)]
*  that Elon Musk and his far right extreme minions [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  have access to their personal and financial information. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay, that's lame, lame, lame. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=323.36s)]
*  Democrats have willful blindness here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=325.0s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries not seen Trump's approval numbers? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=328.56s)]
*  Now, it's not like Democrats though [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=332.92s)]
*  have never cared about reining in big spending. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=334.44s)]
*  JFK was bothered by the cost of furniture [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=336.76s)]
*  in his wife's hospital room. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=340.04s)]
*  Do you see the post this morning? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna see that fellow's picture by the bed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=344.68s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=346.48s)]
*  And you see that furniture they bought from Jordan Marsh? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=347.32s)]
*  What the hell did they let the reporters in there for? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=350.68s)]
*  Christ, if they can throw $5,000 away on this, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=352.76s)]
*  let's cut them another billion dollars. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=355.44s)]

*  change procurement rules, change the personnel rules, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=404.04s)]

*  trying to barge into agencies day after day to make what point? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=447.92s)]
*  Because Doge is inside working hard, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=452.52s)]
*  a lot harder than members of Congress, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=454.8s)]
*  by the way, a lot more hours, to find waste. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=456.28s)]
*  That's money that could be in the taxpayers' pockets [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=459.52s)]

*  Yes. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1107.48s)]
*  You can see more of that Trump-Elon interview on Hannity [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1108.44s)]
*  on Tuesday at 9 o'clock. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  And when 86-year-old Mad Maxine Waters, no relation, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1114.44s)]
*  is the tip of the spear, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1117.52s)]
*  it's time for some new recruits. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1119.16s)]
*  Yeah, Dan, I was wrong, because it looked more like [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1121.8000000000002s)]
*  a senior's home when it canceled Jell-O-Knife. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1124.4s)]
*  It just wasn't optically a good moment for us. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1126.68s)]
*  Democrats only hope as unelected judges to rule on lawsuits [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1131.0s)]
*  brought by unelected lawyers on behalf of unelected bureaucrats [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1134.68s)]
*  to go after an elected president. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1138.76s)]
*  What Trump's doing is popular. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1141.88s)]
*  And there was a time when Democrats [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1143.76s)]
*  would have gone gaga over Doge. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  I joined the Democratic Party in 1989 [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1148.44s)]
*  because I wanted to fight NAFTA. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1150.68s)]
*  I wanted to drain the swamps. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1152.56s)]
*  I wanted to make sure that my tax dollars [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1154.2s)]
*  weren't going to foreign wars or wasted. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1155.64s)]
*  I give you that one, Brian. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1157.52s)]
*  And that sounds like Donald Trump today. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1158.72s)]
*  That's why we lose to him, is we've let him steal our verbiage. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1160.88s)]
*  We have quit talking about working Americas, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1165.16s)]
*  keeping America safe, doing the things that we did [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1168.1200000000001s)]
*  when I joined this party. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1170.0s)]
*  And that's the reason he is scary. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1171.24s)]
*  But he's not scared to enough people to lose elections [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1172.88s)]
*  because he sounds like the Democrats [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  and why I joined this party. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  At the most fundamental level, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1178.44s)]
*  Trump and Elon are giving America a math equation. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  And Democrats are arguing with math, which you can't do. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1183.32s)]
*  Math never loses an argument. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1187.12s)]
*  We're this much in debt. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1189.8s)]
*  We're still spending this much money. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1191.12s)]
*  And we just found this much waste. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1193.12s)]
*  The main reason Democrats are struggling [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1196.12s)]
*  is because there's no lying in math. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4C3YnA22Q&t=1198.28s)]
