# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 31, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk)
*  The richest surrogate for Kamala Harris, billionaire business owner Mark Cuban, thinks conservative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=0.0s)]
*  and independent women working for Trump are stupid and unaccomplished. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=6.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. Ever. It's just that simple. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  They're intimidating to him. He doesn't like to be challenged by them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=18.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, speaking of someone who has challenged him on many occasions, and I think he still [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  respects my opinion, that's a really dumb comment. So just proving billionaires can be bozos as well, I guess, Mark. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=27.68s)]
*  Well, here's a fact check for Mark doesn't have a cluban. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=34.2s)]
*  Here's a small list of those supposedly unintelligent women associated with Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=38.08s)]
*  His wife, Melania, I don't know, does Mark Cuban speak five languages? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=44.16s)]
*  His campaign manager, Susie Wiles, a seasoned political pro. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=48.08s)]
*  America First Policy Institute chief Brooke Rollins, brilliant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=52.32s)]
*  Linda McMahon, also with AFPI, former WWE exec, came up from nothing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=56.32s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway, of course, we all know Kellyanne. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=62.36s)]
*  Governor Sarah Sanders, Kayleigh McEnany, and the list goes on and on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=64.88s)]
*  Now, of course, Cuban was responding to comments made last night by former President Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=70.4s)]
*  People told me about four weeks ago, I was saying, no, I want to protect the people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=80.12s)]
*  Sir, please don't say that. Why? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=83.08s)]
*  They said we think it's we think it's very inappropriate for you to say. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=85.4s)]
*  I said, well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=90.28s)]
*  I'm going to protect them. I'm going to protect them from migrants coming in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=94.2s)]
*  I'm going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=98.36s)]
*  Well, of course, it's clear what he means that he would be a strong president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=105.8s)]
*  Yeah, a protector. The president is supposed to protect us, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=110.56s)]
*  Protector of our borders, our economy and for all people, even for liberal female voters who don't support him now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=113.44s)]
*  And all the women I know, and yes, including Democrats, they do love men who are protectors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=122.4s)]
*  What do they think we want? Men who break and can't fix things? Not attractive. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, it's not sexist for men to want to protect women, and it's not weak for women wanting men to protect them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=133.08s)]
*  Sorry, it's natural. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=141.16000000000003s)]
*  But when Harris is on the trail, she rarely seems natural, and she always seems like she's just reciting rehearsed lines, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  in this case, pretending to be offended by Trump, the protector. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=156.08s)]
*  That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote, whether the women like it or not. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  We must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who you are, who they are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=168.12s)]
*  And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=176.2s)]
*  He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=180.2s)]
*  Oh, their agency. Oh, she sounds like a big lawyer lady there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=189.88s)]
*  Actually, she's just thoroughly unconvincing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter how much she laughs her way through her remarks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=197.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter that she claims to be a uniter who will work with both sides. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=201.92s)]
*  None of that changes the fact that at her core, she is a divisive San Francisco radical. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=205.76s)]
*  And with her and her, you know, call you a Nazi or Hitler because what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  She's going to do that because she can't defend her own agenda. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Everything she did as VP hurt women, her open borders, which let migrants in who abused, trafficked, raped and even killed women and girls. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=223.0s)]
*  Her inflation that robbed young women of the chance to buy a home, that forced senior women back into the workplace to a four daily life, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=233.0s)]
*  that forced women to raid their 401Ks and yet her demonic trans agenda that forced women to compete against biological men in sports. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=241.68s)]
*  And Kamala claims to be pro choice. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  But when it comes to vehicles, her climate change mandates will give women no choice in automobiles. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=253.88s)]
*  If Kamala wins, most will be forced to ditch their gas powered cars. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=260.28s)]
*  I like mine. Thank you very much for EVs and or the greeny acts have their way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=263.32s)]
*  There'll be no cars at all. That's the ultimate dream. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=269.0s)]
*  So how is any of this pro women? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, female voters, I guess, are supposed to agree to a lower standard of living and unsafe streets and throw in perpetual war just because the Supreme Court returned the abortion decision to the states. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=275.4s)]
*  OK, someone has to explain that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=288.32s)]
*  How's that logical? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=290.08s)]
*  The women who people like Mark Cuban look down on aren't one issue voters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=292.28s)]
*  What's driving your vote? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=299.44s)]
*  I just think securing the border and hopefully boosting our economy and voting for Trump and Trump 2024. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=301.76s)]
*  I think he truly made America great in his last run, and I hope he can do it again. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=309.2s)]
*  Farmers matter, automotive matters, Trump matters, and he's going to take care of the farmers and the automotive industry. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=313.76s)]
*  Trump's supporting women. He's for women's rights and even fertility rights. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=319.24s)]
*  And I like that he's against abortion and keeping our country safe. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=323.64s)]
*  But Democrats and their media boosters are so flummoxed by Trump staying power that they keep falling back on the F word. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Even his wanting to protect women now is a threat. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=336.68s)]
*  When you look at him as the protector, I'm not sure what he's talking about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of some distorted fascist way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=344.68s)]
*  Of course, most of these people don't believe that Trump is a threat to women, just like they don't believe he's a fascist or Hitler. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=349.92s)]
*  They're just out of ideas and actually they're just out of gas. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=357.36s)]
*  And they all they can do is hope to scare enough women to push Kamala and her terrible record over 270 electoral votes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=362.04s)]
*  And look, they have a lot of money. They may succeed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=369.64s)]
*  But you're supposed to take solace in stories like this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=372.76s)]
*  Right now, more women, Democrats say, and it looks like this is the case, than men are voting early, 55 to 45. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  But that also includes GOP women voters as well. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=384.12s)]
*  So we'll see how things end up on Tuesday. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=389.52s)]
*  But the trends now are obviously positive in favor of Trump. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=392.24s)]
*  The most accurate poll of the 2020 cycle, Atlas Intel, has Trump up in six of the seven swing states right now, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=397.16s)]
*  although the margins of some of them are very, very tight. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=404.16s)]
*  Now, remember, Kamala signed off on a strategy to go light on policy and heavy on fear and smear during this campaign. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  And in the end, they went all in on January 6 and fascism with a touch of your garbage, courtesy of Biden. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=416.48s)]
*  She repeatedly lies about the abortion issue to frighten women. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=423.92s)]
*  And of course, the press isn't going to fact check her. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=427.64s)]
*  But Trump, he answered her by smiling at the McDonald's drive through, by having fun taking reporters questions in a garbage truck and by forging on undaunted. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=430.48s)]
*  So confident that he's keeping states like New Mexico and Virginia in play. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=442.24s)]
*  But remember, Kamala and her surrogates don't think women voters need to hear solutions on inflation or the border, only abortion fear mongering. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=448.28s)]
*  Now, which candidate insults and patronizes women again? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=457.76s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=461.88s)]
*  Now, we should note that Mark Cuban tweeted out a clarification earlier today noting that there are strong, intelligent women who support Trump. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  But his comment is in line with the personal nastiness going all the way back to Hillary's deplorables comment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=470.96s)]
*  It's a very spooky Halloween, especially if you're Kamala, the ghost of Joe Biden haunting the Harris campaign. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  Garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=487.32s)]
*  Democrats thought Biden would keep him out of trouble. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=490.44s)]
*  But for some reason, Binder handed Joe a laptop and he somehow did more damage with it than Hunter. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=493.32s)]
*  I've watched Trump already seize this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=499.72s)]
*  The basket of deplorables was significant, was meaningful in 2016. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=504.68s)]
*  In 2024, I can promise you that this is going to drive Trump turnout. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=510.04s)]
*  Immediate nose comments like this swing elections. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=515.6s)]
*  USA Today says Biden's comment reminds us he has no business being president. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  Democrats were already wetting the bed before garbage gate. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=525.28s)]
*  Now they're pointing fingers at each other and the election isn't even over. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=528.7199999999999s)]
*  One anonymous Democrat member of Congress who's up for reelection says someone needs to park Biden at a site until after the election. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=532.88s)]
*  Other Democrats are grumbling that Joe should never have run for reelection in the first place and the party shouldn't have crowned Kamala. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=542.4s)]
*  They should have had a regular primary where someone more moderate could have been nominated. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=550.64s)]
*  Democrats have stopped caring about tiptoeing around the big guy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=556.16s)]
*  One Democrat tells The New York Times, we're way past the need to be concerned about the president's feelings. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  If the Harris campaign feels the need to distance themselves, they should feel free to do so. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=567.28s)]
*  But Biden isn't going down without a fight. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=573.0799999999999s)]
*  And neither is Hunter, the first son who's facing years in prison for tax and gun charges. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=575.68s)]
*  It's bitter that Kamala stole his daddy's job. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=581.64s)]
*  Hunter says if Kamala doesn't win, it could be the end of America as we know it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=584.72s)]
*  Now, Hunter needs a partner. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=590.72s)]
*  So if I were him, I wouldn't be getting on anyone's bad side. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=592.0s)]
*  Just sell your paintings and lay low. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=595.76s)]
*  Biden's people think Joe should be running. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  Or if he's not running, at least be campaigning with Kamala. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=601.96s)]
*  He should be out there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=605.52s)]
*  The reason she's where she is, is because of him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=607.12s)]
*  Biden says, don't point the finger at me. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=611.96s)]
*  Point him at Kamala. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=613.92s)]
*  And some Democrats already are. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=615.28s)]
*  Obama's people are leaking that she looks really silly for not picking Shapiro. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=617.52s)]
*  Would I want to have a beer with Walls? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=623.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=625.56s)]
*  But let's face it, he wasn't a great choice. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=626.56s)]
*  One Democrat says all the sniping, just Democrats trying to cover their asses and get a little [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=630.0s)]
*  ahead of election day. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=634.12s)]
*  But really, they're just disappointed in Harris. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=636.8s)]
*  They're admitting she has a messaging problem. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=639.84s)]
*  And she keeps talking about Trump and not the economy, stupid. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=642.56s)]
*  Oh, and Bill Clinton? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=645.56s)]
*  Not helping. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=647.72s)]
*  You did pretty well when I was president, and I think I'm entitled to my opinion about [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=648.72s)]
*  who'd be better. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=653.4s)]
*  I don't think it's right to say that people have to vote for Donald Trump because the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=655.0s)]
*  economy was better there. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=661.76s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=663.36s)]
*  Bill just said Trump's economy was better than Kamala's. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=666.04s)]
*  And this is a week after he said Lakin Reilly would be alive if the border czar would have [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=669.16s)]
*  done her job. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=673.52s)]
*  The Clintons are like, if Hillary can't be the first female president, no one can. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=675.12s)]
*  The vibes are off. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=680.56s)]
*  Yesterday, Kamala got heckled at three rallies in a row. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=681.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=685.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's answer to financial pressures is for you to face the same deal. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=686.64s)]
*  And I pledge to you, I will listen to experts. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=697.32s)]
*  I will listen to those impacted by the decisions I make. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=701.48s)]
*  And to people who disagree with me. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  An opportunity in... [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=709.48s)]
*  Hey, you know what? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=712.6s)]
*  Listen, we all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=713.96s)]
*  So the Democrat base is just as fractured as the party brass. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=720.2s)]
*  How are they going to unify the country if they can't even unify themselves? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=724.04s)]
*  Even Mourning Joe is breaking down. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=728.16s)]
*  The hypocrisy, Mika, over a misstatement by Joe Biden, which he quickly corrected, is [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=730.92s)]
*  so laughable because this guy does this every day. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=738.48s)]
*  And then you turn on Fox News and say, oh, how could anybody do this? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  I've never seen this before. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=746.92s)]
*  Kamala grew up in a middle-class family and Trump's the one in trucks and drive-throughs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=752.04s)]
*  It's got to be driving them nuts. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=760.04s)]
*  She's campaigning with rich celebrities and Trump's at the barbershop with cops and firefighters. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=763.12s)]
*  What the hell happened to the Democrat party? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=768.8399999999999s)]
*  The Bidens have offshore bank accounts and Trump's winning the union vote. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  The party of Hollywood can't even produce a moment, not a single moment. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=776.2s)]
*  But Trump the reality star is directing his own blockbuster from the sidewalk, from the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=781.36s)]
*  mugshot to the gunshot, from the McDonald's apron to the garbage vest. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=786.24s)]
*  These are four of the most iconic pictures in presidential campaign history. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  And they all came from this campaign. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=795.36s)]
*  Trump's dancing down the home stretch because the people are turning out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  Republicans have been registering voters in big, huge numbers. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=804.0s)]
*  They have been gaining in party registration versus the Democrats in the swing states with [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=808.28s)]
*  party registration. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=812.2s)]
*  We're talking Arizona. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=813.4s)]
*  How about Nevada? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=814.4s)]
*  Big Republican registrations there. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=815.48s)]
*  They like the early vote. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=816.92s)]
*  How about North Carolina? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=817.96s)]
*  Big Republican registration gains. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=819.32s)]
*  How about Pennsylvania? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=821.0s)]
*  We spoke about it before a few months ago. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=822.16s)]
*  Big Republican party registration gains versus from where they were four years ago. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=824.2s)]
*  So the bottom line is if Republicans win, come next week. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=829.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins, comes next week. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=832.72s)]
*  The signs all along will have been obvious. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  We would look at the right direction being very low, Joe Biden's approval rating being [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=836.9200000000001s)]
*  very low and Republicans really registering numbers. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=840.28s)]
*  You can't say you weren't warned. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=843.4s)]
*  The race is tight, but Democrats are anxious because black turnout's down, mail-in ballots [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=846.0s)]
*  are down and Republicans are coming out strong for the early vote. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  You can feel the energy and the momentum in the air. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=855.96s)]
*  It reminds me so much of 2016 and I think there are a lot of similarities right now [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  between this campaign and that campaign. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=864.56s)]
*  The divisions in the country were significant back then. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=868.16s)]
*  People didn't think Trump had a chance back then. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=871.4s)]
*  I don't know who's going to win. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=873.5999999999999s)]
*  However, the momentum is clearly in what I see and what I hear is in his favor. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=875.28s)]
*  And just like in 2016, the Democrats are running on hoaxes instead of their record. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=882.2399999999999s)]
*  New hoax alert. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=886.72s)]
*  New hoax alert. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=888.2s)]
*  New hoax alert. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=889.76s)]
*  So last night in Wisconsin, Trump said he wanted to protect women from migrant crime, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=891.44s)]
*  whether they like it or not. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=895.84s)]
*  Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=897.88s)]
*  mental institutions all over the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, including savage criminals [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=904.88s)]
*  who assault, rape and murder our women and girls. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=911.88s)]
*  Anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=921.78s)]
*  And my people told me about four weeks ago, I would say, No, I want to protect the people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=927.88s)]
*  I want to protect the women of our country. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=932.12s)]
*  I want to protect the women. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=934.04s)]
*  Sir, please don't say that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=935.3599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  We think it's very inappropriate for you to say. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=938.08s)]
*  I said, Why? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=941.88s)]
*  I'm president. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=942.88s)]
*  I want to protect the women of our country. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=943.88s)]
*  They said, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=945.84s)]
*  They said, Sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=950.84s)]
*  Pay these guys a lot of money. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=953.44s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=954.64s)]
*  I said, Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=955.64s)]
*  I'm going to protect them. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=960.0400000000001s)]
*  Kamala took this and twisted it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  They said, Sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=965.08s)]
*  I said, Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=967.86s)]
*  I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=971.86s)]
*  Whether the women like it or not, whether the women like it or not. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=974.5400000000001s)]
*  Whether the women like it or not, whether the women like it or not, I'm going to do [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=978.14s)]
*  it whether the women like it or not. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=981.88s)]
*  Trump says he wants to protect women from migrant killers whether the women voted for [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=984.72s)]
*  him or not. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=989.4s)]
*  And Kamala's campaign says Trump's going to control women, whether they like it or [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=990.88s)]
*  not. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=995.02s)]
*  It was almost as dirty of an edit as 60 Minutes. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=996.02s)]
*  And it's gonna incite Democrats to violence. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=999.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1001.34s)]
*  It's comments like, he's gonna take care of women whether they like it or not. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1002.34s)]
*  That just makes you clench your fist. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1006.02s)]
*  It makes me clench my fist. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1007.9s)]
*  I wanna smack him across the face. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1009.42s)]
*  He's not taking care of me or my body. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1014.3s)]
*  Would Democrat women rather be assaulted by migrants than protected by Trump? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1015.3s)]
*  Because I'm having a hard time understanding the logic. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1019.8s)]
*  If wanting to protect women is an insult, then you can kiss civilization goodbye. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1023.06s)]
*  We don't have to invent insults around here. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1028.54s)]
*  We can just listen to the Democrats talk. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1030.46s)]
*  Mark Cuban just called Republican women stupid. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1032.74s)]
*  Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1036.78s)]
*  Ever. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1040.46s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1041.46s)]
*  They're intimidating to him. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1042.94s)]
*  He doesn't like to be challenged by them. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1044.34s)]
*  The party they can't even define a woman is saying women for Trump are dumb. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1048.2s)]
*  They say the smart ones lie to their husbands and secretly vote for Harris. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  And the real men lie to their friends about voting Trump. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1057.32s)]
*  They say Doug Emhoff lifts women up and Tampon Tim's a man's man. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1060.64s)]
*  And if you don't vote for Harris, you ain't black. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1065.0s)]
*  The party running on solving problems and bringing the country together is calling the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1068.22s)]
*  country dumb Nazi garbage who should lie to their friends and family. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1072.5s)]
*  And this is after they lied to you about COVID, inflation, the border and the president's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1077.3s)]
*  mental state. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1081.3s)]
*  This election is about who do you trust to take out the trash? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1083.1399999999999s)]
*  A woman who has a record of making a mess or a man with a record of fixing things. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1087.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1094.62s)]
*  Your appreciation underwhelms me. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1098.74s)]
*  Happy Thursday, everyone. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1102.5s)]
*  Today is Halloween and I'm really starting to panic. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1103.86s)]
*  I need three more guys to fill out the ass of my Joy Behar costume. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1107.26s)]
*  But everyone's getting dressed up. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1113.54s)]
*  James Carville is going as a blind mole rat. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1115.3400000000001s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is going as one of her ancestors. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1120.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris will be dressing up as a Hispanic, black, Asian, Puerto Rican, Jamaican, Muslim [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1127.02s)]
*  and Jewish woman. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1131.54s)]
*  Hillary Clinton going as Monica Lewinsky with hopes to get laid. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1135.1s)]
*  David Muir, Norah O'Donnell and Dana Bash will all be going as journalists. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1143.98s)]
*  And last but not least, Nancy Pelosi is going as herself. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1152.06s)]
*  Nothing scarier than that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1157.74s)]
*  So while Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed Kamala Harris, legendary astronaut Buzz Aldrin endorsed [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1162.66s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1167.78s)]
*  Pretty, pretty similar stories. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1169.7s)]
*  One landed on the moon, the other one landed on his maid. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1174.72s)]
*  But you can see why Arnold went with Kamala. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1181.42s)]
*  She said she would clean house if elected and he can't resist a lady holding a mop. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1183.78s)]
*  Last night, rioters descended on Los Angeles after the Dodgers won the World Series, where [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1191.22s)]
*  many of these rioters first learned that the Dodgers won the World Series. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1199.38s)]
*  Such a coincidence. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1204.38s)]
*  Two LA erupted into chaos with looters raiding a Nike store at a mob burn in a bus. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1210.74s)]
*  Things are so bad, the Menendez brothers are now demanding to stay in prison. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1216.06s)]
*  And President Biden bit a baby dressed as a chicken at a White House Halloween party. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1223.42s)]
*  Well now who's the cannibal? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1230.3s)]
*  His doctor said they're just glad the baby wasn't dressed as a thermometer. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1233.6200000000001s)]
*  So disgusting. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1245.98s)]
*  But just a joke. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1250.58s)]
*  So what do you do when somebody calls you garbage? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1252.22s)]
*  Of course it matters if it's from someone whose opinion you value, like your spouse [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1254.5s)]
*  or your relative or that Chinese lap dancer I met in Croatia. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1258.6200000000001s)]
*  But what if it's coming from this guy? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1263.78s)]
*  I mean this guy thinks you're garbage? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1266.34s)]
*  The guy who didn't even acknowledge he had a grandchild because she came from the wrong [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1268.8600000000001s)]
*  side of the tracks? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1272.46s)]
*  To him, she was garbage. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1274.18s)]
*  Which kind of makes him garbage. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1276.3400000000001s)]
*  And yet Joe called Trump supporters garbage. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1278.46s)]
*  And the next day Trump showed up for a campaign event asking the media one question. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1281.7800000000002s)]
*  How do you like my garbage truck? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1287.98s)]
*  How do you like my garbage truck? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1289.7s)]
*  This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1292.3400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden should be ashamed of himself if he knows what he's even doing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1295.8200000000002s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed this garbage truck. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1299.42s)]
*  We enjoy it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  So Joe calls Trump supporters garbage. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1303.62s)]
*  Trump shows up for a campaign event in a garbage truck. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1307.78s)]
*  I wonder what would happen if Biden had called them d***. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1311.34s)]
*  Would Trump have showed up in this? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1317.34s)]
*  Yeah, he would. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1319.62s)]
*  You know he would. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1322.4199999999998s)]
*  So what does this moment matter? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1323.4199999999998s)]
*  Well first, the same media that went insane over a comedian's joke about a trash crisis [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1325.02s)]
*  in the U.S. territory now views Biden calling half the country garbage a hoax. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1329.26s)]
*  The very same news media that ignored all the times Donald Trump has called American [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1334.58s)]
*  citizens and American voters scum and garbage actually tried to turn Joe Biden's use of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1341.06s)]
*  the word garbage into a controversial news story today. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1348.9s)]
*  He landed in Green Bay just a short time ago and then pulled this campaign stunt speaking [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1352.5s)]
*  to reporters from a garbage truck, proof that he and his supporters are giving no grace [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1357.74s)]
*  to a gaffe by President Biden where he, in his explanation, inadvertently called Trump [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1362.34s)]
*  supporters garbage. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1367.1799999999998s)]
*  You see that inadvertently? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1368.98s)]
*  Like that was inadvertent. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1371.1599999999999s)]
*  Like when I inadvertently landed on that candlestick. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1373.12s)]
*  But sure the garbage line could be misconstrued. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1382.6999999999998s)]
*  But do we owe them that grace as Nora suggests? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1386.46s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1390.14s)]
*  After all, Biden rode in on the most divisive lie ever, the fine people hoax, which was [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1391.14s)]
*  thoroughly debunked. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1395.42s)]
*  Worse it was the tent pole hoax that initiated the Trump is Hitler narrative that they've [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1397.5s)]
*  been pushing ever since. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1402.3s)]
*  It was divisive, destructive, and even when they knew it was false, they kept at it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  So forgive me if I don't give a f*** if Biden just got fine people hoaxed. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1408.48s)]
*  What's good for the goose is good for the slander. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1413.06s)]
*  So while Joe's biting babies, Trump is chewing up Kamala's campaign like a toddler dressed [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1415.72s)]
*  as a Big Mac. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1420.28s)]
*  But there's a bigger problem. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1422.9s)]
*  Whether you're called irredeemable, deplorable, or garbage, the rot is coming from the top [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1424.4s)]
*  and it's undermining the fabric of the social contract. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1429.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not team sport politics. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1432.84s)]
*  I got no problems with tribes, allegiances, clubs, even cults. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1434.2s)]
*  Hell, I had Scientologists as neighbors and they were always willing to invite me over [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1438.6000000000001s)]
*  for a threesome. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1442.76s)]
*  Because there was always a bedrock premise underneath it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1443.76s)]
*  It's the cheesiest phrase ever, love thy neighbor. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1450.36s)]
*  It's corny because we get it wrong. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1453.8s)]
*  When we hear love thy neighbor, we think of Ned Flanders offering a high diddly ho neighborino [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1456.08s)]
*  to Homer. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1460.56s)]
*  But love thy neighbor doesn't matter when things are good, only, only when it's bad. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1461.94s)]
*  And if Kamala wins, you both may have to fend off roving gangs of transgender Venezuelans [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1466.96s)]
*  with student loan debt. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  That societal agreement is no different than the first or the second amendment. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1474.0s)]
*  They don't exist for hello and goodbye. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1478.16s)]
*  It's for bad words and bad hombres. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1479.8000000000002s)]
*  Which means no matter who you root for, you're still neighbors. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1482.44s)]
*  If you're a Yankees fan and you live next to a Red Sox fan, don't sit near each other [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1484.92s)]
*  again. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1489.16s)]
*  Actually, you may both want to avoid both those cities. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1490.16s)]
*  But you can still borrow the leaf blower. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1494.0400000000002s)]
*  But then return the favor by leaving your blinds open when you undress. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1496.2800000000002s)]
*  But love thy neighbor became immoral once radicals made the political personal. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1502.6000000000001s)]
*  In the 60s, the left's most heralded voices declared that every relationship is one of [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1507.72s)]
*  power between boss and worker, husband and wife, white and black, even me and my pool [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1512.0s)]
*  boy. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  I keep telling him someday I'll get a pool. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1520.0s)]
*  Suddenly the quality of connection turns vertical. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1525.96s)]
*  It's no longer we're in this together. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1529.92s)]
*  It's now who's on top. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1532.2s)]
*  They changed love thy neighbor into love thy neighbor unless we disagree. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1533.96s)]
*  The relationship is transactional, but not based on neighborly stuff. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1537.88s)]
*  But now your neighbor won't talk to you if you're voting for Trump. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1542.2s)]
*  Now I know, do you really want to jerk like that in your life anyways? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1546.24s)]
*  But that's where calling half the country Nazi garbage gets you. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1550.0s)]
*  You end up in a place where it's harder and harder to return to loving one's neighbor [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1552.96s)]
*  when the media and their team calls them trash. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1556.52s)]
*  My advice, get your lawn tools back before Tuesday. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2loILF9hsk&t=1559.28s)]
