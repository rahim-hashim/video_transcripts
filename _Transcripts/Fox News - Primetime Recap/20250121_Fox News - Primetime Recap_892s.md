# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 20, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY)
*  Inside the rotunda for President Trump's swearing in I'm telling you guys it was surreal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=0.0s)]
*  The entire Trump family they shined like a new dawn [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=6.12s)]
*  The man whose approach and policies dominated global politics for the past decade [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=10.32s)]
*  Back in charge and his message was at its core very optimistic and very forward-looking [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=15.16s)]
*  The golden age of America begins right now from this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=21.8s)]
*  all over the world [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=29.66s)]
*  We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=31.66s)]
*  During every single day of the Trump administration I will very simply put [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=40.06s)]
*  America first [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=46.94s)]
*  So why was putting America first? Why was that ever controversial to anyone if you're an American? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=49.22s)]
*  It should be your instinct just like you put your country first put it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=56.14s)]
*  You know put your America first your family's first America is your family [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=60.02s)]
*  We're all family and when family is hurt or threatened family stands together [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=64.02s)]
*  So we asked for God's intervention and today it was clear that Trump believes his presidency is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=69.26s)]
*  Divinely inspired and was divinely protected during the campaign [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=75.82s)]
*  Just a few months ago in a beautiful, Pennsylvania field an assassin's bullet ripped through [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  my ear [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  For a reason I was saved by God to make America great again [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  And I watched as the old guard they walked in in our figures with their own White House biographies [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  the Clintons Bush [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=112.5s)]
*  Obama and they're all smart enough to know that today was not just a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=115.02s)]
*  Repudiation of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. It was a crushing defeat for all of their worldviews [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=119.66s)]
*  Now the occasional flashes of bitterness and disbelief can't really blame them. I guess it was on their faces [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=125.9s)]
*  It was all very visceral. And although Biden himself, he seemed a little befuddled by it all [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=131.56s)]
*  I was up close watching it and but to all of them Trump's comeback. It wasn't historic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=137.02s)]
*  It was an enraging indictment of the American voter who they think isn't sophisticated enough to understand how dangerous Trump is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=142.84s)]
*  And of course, it wouldn't be a Trump speech without his reminding us of just how badly they screwed it up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=150.84s)]
*  They screwed the country up. That's why he's here after all so a politicized DOJ open borders inflationary spending more war [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=157.76s)]
*  My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=166.76s)]
*  betrayal and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=173.0s)]
*  all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith their wealth their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=174.6s)]
*  democracy and indeed their freedom [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=183.88s)]
*  from this moment on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=187.44s)]
*  America's decline is over [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=190.2s)]
*  And [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=192.92s)]
*  The sheer sight of the tech titans who lined up behind Trump [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=197.6s)]
*  Trillions in wealth controlled and generated is their desire to make Trump successful real besides musk [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, we'll see now. I had the chance to chat briefly with Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Sergey Sergey Brin now all of them seemed oddly relieved to be here to be there [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=214.88s)]
*  They were very nice, but undoubtedly Trump's agenda won't always make them happy nor should it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=221.52s)]
*  But as I told one of them their life of entrepreneurship and ambition [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=226.72s)]
*  It really naturally should find a home within the Republican Party [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=231.0s)]
*  Because after all merit reigned supreme in the computer science and engineering and it should across the entire employment spectrum [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=234.44s)]
*  Advances in technology makes what we thought [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Impossible possible. It's inspiring [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=245.92s)]
*  many people thought [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=249.12s)]
*  It was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=251.2s)]
*  But as you see today here I am the American people have spoken [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=256.56s)]
*  I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=260.48s)]
*  In America the impossible is what we do best [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=266.8s)]
*  And I love it we're now looking at Donald Trump's motorcade [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=273.48s)]
*  Leaving the Capital One arena [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=278.12s)]
*  Little easier job getting through DC when you have it all cleared out [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=280.24s)]
*  So he's heading back home back to the White House and the moving boxes Bidens are out [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=283.88s)]
*  Trump's already set up the Oval Office the diet coke button is back [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  But it's governing time and governing we know is not easy [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Especially with such a slim majority [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=297.8s)]
*  But Trump got going today with a flurry of executive orders ranging from immigration to limiting regulations [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=299.92s)]
*  Regulations pulling some of them back. He even did the signings in public, which I love no more behind closed doors nonsense [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=306.04s)]
*  In all of my political commentary years, and it's been like almost three decades [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  This right now. It's an exciting. This is the best chance that all of us have had in decades [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=318.48s)]
*  To put the interests of the American people the average American first [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=325.56s)]
*  Last time in office remember Donald Trump is sitting in that beast of a car right now [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=330.0s)]
*  He was derailed by lawfare impeachment and kovat [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=334.52s)]
*  But now is a new day and the Democrats have been completely discredited and disgraced [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=338.4s)]
*  By the last round of pardons from Biden. Oh boy, we're gonna get into that more on that later [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=344.76s)]
*  So tonight as we're watching president Trump go back to the White House quick change of clothes before he comes here to the Liberty Ball [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=350.28s)]
*  We urge the Republicans and the House and Senate you got the majority [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=357.44s)]
*  Most of whom are there because of presidents Trump's popularity [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=361.96s)]
*  To support his efforts to reform the government and move this country in a common-sense direction [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  If Republicans fight Trump if they resist his agenda on immigration or spending cuts trade for imposit this celebration tonight [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  It won't seem as historic in hindsight. It'll just seem like another opportunity wasted in Washington [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=381.52s)]
*  But if Republicans take this whole day and this whole night in they help push Trump through his agenda [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=388.44s)]
*  Help push it through regardless of the lawsuits and the left-wing attacks [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=395.8s)]
*  This can truly be I am telling you a new golden age for America [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=400.2s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and we are broadcasting live. We are at the commander-in-chief ball [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=406.84000000000003s)]

*  Let's hear what Adam Schiff who got a preemptive pardon today and what Chuck Schumer [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeKS-aEHxCY&t=621.9200000000001s)]
