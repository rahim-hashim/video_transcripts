# Fox News Highlights - June 20th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g)
*  Hating America and resisting America. That is the focus of tonight's angle. It's time to simplify things. Now the left wing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=0.0s)]
*  protests that we're seeing rage across the country. They may at first glance seem to be focused on different causes. Anti [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=12.46s)]
*  Zionist anti ice pro trans. But at their core they have one common denominator. The forces organizing them. Fat Cat [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=20.06s)]
*  Democrat groups assorted socialists and open borders fanatics are deeply anti American. And the slope that they've created [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=29.7s)]
*  is a slippery one. Now remember five years ago BLM Marxists and street thugs legitimize the ripping down of historic [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=38.04s)]
*  statues and markers. And today they've taken it a step further. They're burning the American flag and it's almost become [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=45.42s)]
*  commonplace. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=52.9s)]
*  Well the Mexican flag is flown proudly to say this is our land. You stole it and we're taking it back. Of course they're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=82.9s)]
*  ignorant of their own history. They don't know it. Now equally as commonplace is the waving of other foreign flags on U.S. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  soil. Again the message is America is just not special. Well remember we purchased California and half of Mexico in 1848 [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=103.3s)]
*  for 15 million dollars after we won the Mexican-American War. So maybe some of these people waving the Mexican flag should [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=114.34s)]
*  consider getting off the protest circuit and opening a book once in a while. Now in all these protests we see the that the idea [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=121.42s)]
*  of the melting pot in America that was was what legal immigration was all about. That is long gone. Now foreigners who come [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=129.26s)]
*  here feel entitled and expect us to melt into their cultures embracing America abiding by our laws honoring our customs. That is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=138.18s)]
*  out the window. Instead of bringing America into your own experience they're encouraged to resist America. So you got online [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=147.02s)]
*  propaganda bought and paid for by rich Democrat donors feeds this radicalism and heck many of our own schools teach them to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=156.78s)]
*  resist the government here. There has never been a more dangerous dealer of death than the American Empire. Our aim is to is to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=165.74s)]
*  dismantle that empire. Hamas has punctured the illusion of invincibility. It was exhilarating it was energizing. Revolution. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=174.54s)]
*  Is always violent. The revolution is always driven by radical love. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=187.02s)]
*  Look and parents I think they believe that sending their kids to some of our most vaunted institutions of higher learning will give [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=197.38s)]
*  their kids a leg up. Well maybe. But you also might run into people like this specimen. Alejandra Caraballo proud trans clinical [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=204.54s)]
*  instructor whatever that is at Harvard Law School who after the court's decision affirming the Tennessee ban on trans surgeries [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=215.74s)]
*  posted I honestly don't care anymore if this country destroys itself and burns down to the ground. The current form of the United [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=223.74s)]
*  States is incompatible with democracy or human rights. It no longer has any legitimacy to govern and I'll dance on its grave. Let [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  something better rise from the ashes. This clinical instructors wrote so rise from the ashes. The ashes is where her or his or [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=238.7s)]
*  whatever their career should be after that now deleted post. Imagine your tuition dollars going to pay that salary. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=247.54s)]
*  But look we have sitting members of Congress who essentially believe the same thing. America hater Ilan Omar sounds like she [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=257.26s)]
*  thinks her native Somalia is better than the country that gave her refugee protection. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=264.54s)]
*  To have a democracy a beacon of hope for the world to to now be turned into one of the you know one of the worst countries where [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  where where the military are in our streets without any regard for people's constitutional rights. While our president is spending [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=284.1s)]
*  millions of dollars prompting himself up like a failed dictator with a military parade. It is really shocking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=292.98s)]
*  Shocking. Trump must be a really bad dictator by the way since several hundred protests took place across the country that Saturday. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=304.78s)]
*  The violence that took place was instigated by the left. Congresswoman again these protesters they don't care about migrants they don't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=311.9s)]
*  care about Muslims they don't care about trans. They care about destabilizing America and making the country seem ungovernable [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=320.78s)]
*  as long as Trump is in the White House in Portland Oregon which was a once sleepy town tracked in kind of a harmless granola [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=329.5s)]
*  bunch and the outdoorsy mix. There we now have trained agitators who play dress up in all black bike helmets ski goggles. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=338.17999999999995s)]
*  Most were probably pick last and gym class. That's what I've just discovered. They all belong in a psychiatric facility or in jail. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=348.38s)]
*  And this is how things go down there. Portland police declared a riot had broken out at the ice facility at around 630 in the evening [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=356.5s)]
*  after a federal officer was hurt. Police ordered the protesters to leave using tear gas. But the night led to three arrests one [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=364.58s)]
*  arrest for attempted assault on an officer. Another was arrested after police saw someone throw a rock at the building. Officers [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=372.62s)]
*  reported being pepper sprayed while making that arrest. Police arrested a third person who they say was picking up traffic control [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=379.5s)]
*  devices and putting them in his truck. Now this has been nonstop madness. That's kind of a tame look at what Portland's look like. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  But for a long time it's been tolerated by the liberal elected officials who spend more time empathizing with the protesters who are [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=396.98s)]
*  just thugs than actually prosecuting them. And they pay lip service by the way thanking our police. But at every turn they [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=405.42s)]
*  coddle and encourage criminals. So the chaotic scenes played on endless loops on X. They're depressing spectacles and they're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=414.38s)]
*  meant to demoralize young people. Again they believe that America is rotten to the core. That anti-Western bile is the hub of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=422.98s)]
*  the protest wheel. And the situation is similar overseas. If you follow my Instagram you might have seen my posts about the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=432.46s)]
*  pro-Palestine anti-Israel protests at London's Parliament Square right when we landed on Saturday. That's what we saw. Now wait [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=440.78s)]
*  when you watch this. Wait for the crazy girl dancer at the end. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  That woman was kind of part deadhead part West Tater. Now notice the Iranian flags that are now mixed into the crowd. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  If you look carefully zero in on that they even have their own mobile wardrobe. I discovered when I walked through this if you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=478.3s)]
*  really want to honor Hamas you have to go all out. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  They didn't like it when I zeroed in on that socialist workers party tent. They don't like that at all. But the goal is always the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  same to sow chaos and division. And remember these agitators they rarely create anything of value. They only know how to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=507.1s)]
*  destroy. But we are on to their sick game. We know real hate when we see it and we will never let them destroy America. And [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=518.5400000000001s)]
*  that's the angle. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=527.98s)]
*  Fox News alert there's been an earthquake in Iran five point one magnitude right outside the capital. But the war isn't slowing [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=528.66s)]
*  down. Iranian missiles hitting cities in Israel. One missile hitting an Israeli daycare center. The USS Nimitz carrier strike [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=539.78s)]
*  group arrives in the region this weekend doubling the number of aircraft carriers there. Trump telling reporters that two weeks is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=548.54s)]
*  in a deadline. Anything could happen before then. Does Iran have two weeks or could you strike before that. Are you essentially giving [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=556.46s)]
*  them a two week timeline. Giving them a period of time. We're going to see what that period of time is. But I'm giving them a period of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=564.26s)]
*  time and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. This period of time gives Trump more military options as he moves more assets [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=569.26s)]
*  into place. It could also be a setup for a surprise attack and it lets Israel soften up Iranian targets and suppress their capacity to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=578.5s)]
*  retaliate if Trump does decide to join the offensive. Continued Israeli bombardment could pressure the Iranians to sign away their [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=587.18s)]
*  new program. Trump's hoping that's the case. Today Iranian negotiators met with European diplomats in Switzerland but there was no [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=595.42s)]
*  breakthrough. The regime continues to insist on enrichment. Trump says negotiations with the Europeans waste of time. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=603.9s)]
*  Iranian negotiators are saying they'll only meet with the United States if Israel stops its airstrikes. But Trump has already said we're not [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=624.66s)]
*  interested in a ceasefire. We want a solution. And the Israeli airstrikes have been very effective. Would you support Iran being able to have [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=632.54s)]
*  civilian nuclear energy capabilities up to three point seven six percent. You know they're sitting on the top of one of the largest piles of oil in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=641.98s)]
*  the world. I just don't know why they need that for civilian work. You know it's one thing for certain countries to say hey I want to have a [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  certain amount where I could go nuclear a little bit because we need it for electricity. We need it for air conditioners etc. But when you're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=656.82s)]
*  sitting on one of the largest oil piles anywhere in the world it's a little bit hard to see why you did that. The march to war was picking up [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=666.22s)]
*  speed and the two week window takes the pressure off and gives Trump control of the timeline. Not Netanyahu. There's risks to action and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=673.86s)]
*  there's risks to inaction. It's like life saving emergency surgery. It's delicate and dangerous. Sources say the president's looking at what [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=682.34s)]
*  happened to Libya. Quote The president in recent days has specifically mentioned the oil rich North African countries decades long plunge into [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=691.5400000000001s)]
*  anarchy in 2011 after the U.S. joined a NATO bombing campaign to oust dictator Moammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi saw America topple Saddam over WMDs. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=699.1800000000001s)]
*  So he got rid of his program voluntarily thinking it would save him from an invasion. But Obama Hillary and the Europeans exploited the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=710.7s)]
*  vulnerability launched airstrikes and Gaddafi was brutally murdered by the Arab Street. Libya is now a failed state. It's run by militias and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=718.86s)]
*  terrorists and Europe had to absorb waves of refugees. Air campaigns aren't always successful. Look at North Vietnam. Look at Kosovo. They're [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=727.94s)]
*  attractive because they limit casualties. But Trump's ruled out boots on the ground. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=738.46s)]
*  Iran's mountains and deserts create a natural fortress and any ground assault would be a death wish. If the Ayatollah is taking out in an [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  airstrike or a coup there's no natural opposition group to seize power. Those in charge will be men with guns and they will try to bring back [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=759.98s)]
*  some sort of clerical leadership because after all this is an Islamic republic. If the supreme leader were toppled and foreign enemies sought to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  foment public unrest by bombarding the country and forcing a no fly zone and applying economic pressure as they did against Saddam Hussein's Iraq [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=779.26s)]
*  in the 90s the guard would use brute force to maintain power. This is the reason Trump and his team have been working around the clock to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=787.86s)]
*  reach a deal behind the scenes. 47 knows if you snuff out the Ayatollah without planning for the aftermath he owns what happens next. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  Are you concerned that Oman or its proxies would wage terror attacks against American targets abroad if you order military action? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=806.3399999999999s)]
*  We're always concerned about that and we have to take them out and be very strong. You're even in danger talking to me right now. Do you know that? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=814.9s)]
*  You are in danger talking to me right now. So I should probably get out of here but you guys are actually in danger. Can you believe it? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=822.3399999999999s)]
*  If the United States did take military action the Iranians could have a clandestine nuclear operation. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=831.1400000000001s)]
*  They could activate it without knowing and spin up a nuke in the dark. Once the missiles start flying things move fast. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=837.62s)]
*  The exiled Shah's son is already meeting with congressmen and planning for a post-Ayatollah Iran. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=845.7800000000001s)]
*  At least there's planning for what comes next. You couldn't say that for some of these other wars. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=853.0600000000001s)]
*  This is why there's only one commander in chief. President Bill Clinton he was given an opportunity to preemptively strike North Korea's nuclear program in the 90s. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=859.3s)]
*  He chose not to and today North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile within the range of California. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=869.7s)]
*  Bill Clinton also was given the opportunity to take out bin Laden in the 90s. He chose not to and then just a few years later 9-11. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=878.58s)]
*  Iraq, Libya, North Korea, bin Laden these are all fresh in 47's mind. As he likes to say we'll see what happens. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrI1KhUcz1g&t=886.82s)]
