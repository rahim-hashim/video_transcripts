*  We're now entering the days of thunder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=0.0s)]
*  That's how insiders are describing the second Trump term. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=6.8s)]
*  The greatest comeback in political history is just getting started. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=9.72s)]
*  A little while ago, corporate America saw Trump as toxic, but now MAGA is the hottest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=12.92s)]
*  brand in town. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Just this week, Trump received the highest award a president can get. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=19.92s)]
*  The first ever presidential commemorative can of Diet Coke. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=24.04s)]
*  Get ready for McDonald's Big Mac and Chief. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=28.78s)]
*  Companies want to be associated with Trump, and they want you to know it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=32.02s)]
*  The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=36.22s)]
*  is no longer there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=41.42s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen two months from now, but for today, up and down, corporate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=43.18s)]
*  America is solidly pro-Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  The biggest brands in America, look at these right here, each donated a million large. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=51.18000000000001s)]
*  Home lobbyists said everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=56.54s)]
*  We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=60.74s)]
*  Trump's not running for reelection, so he can use the money for anything from his library [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=65.46s)]
*  to making sure Republicans keep the house. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=69.6s)]
*  He can even use some of it to pay off Kamala's debt, if he's so inclined. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  One Trump advisor told Axios, the money is just pouring in at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=77.38s)]
*  Trump doesn't have to lift a finger. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=83.22s)]
*  What's coming to him? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=86.02s)]
*  Sure, Trump will cash the check, but that doesn't mean he owes you anything. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=87.5s)]
*  The president was overheard telling an executive this, quote, you guys made this amount of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  money last year, and you're going to make so much more now because of me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=96.34s)]
*  But when I needed you, where the F were you? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=100.66s)]
*  You weren't with me, and maybe you were with her. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=103.94s)]
*  A big part of Trump's second term is making sure America's on the cutting edge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=107.62s)]
*  are getting positions of honor on Trump's inauguration stage. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=113.14s)]
*  Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, TikTok CEO, and the biggest name in AI, Sam Altman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  One official said, I think the message it sends is first, the importance of free speech, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=124.14s)]
*  and then that these are all huge job creators in this country, and they're going to be a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=128.86s)]
*  big part of where this president goes in the second term. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=133.46s)]
*  These guys all used to be in Biden's corner. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=137.5s)]
*  Now they're America's first. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=140.04s)]
*  Four years ago, the Democratic Party had the White House, it had the Senate, it had the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  House, it had the popular vote, and it had Silicon Valley on its side. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  Over the past four years, the Democratic Party has lost the House, lost the Senate, lost [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=152.28s)]
*  the White House, lost the popular vote, and now has lost Silicon Valley, which means the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  billionaires are on the other side of the table. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=161.12s)]
*  Biden's pretty bitter about the tech turncoats. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=164.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=166.64s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=168.0s)]
*  This is a dangerous, and that's the dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=173.4s)]
*  few ultra wealthy people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=178.16s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=180.72s)]
*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=186.6s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=192.72s)]
*  The big guy has a point about how powerful big tech is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=195.4s)]
*  They crush their competition. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  They can censor speech and use their deep pockets and influence to sway elections. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't blindly trust them because they can switch right back. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  But why would Biden wait until his farewell address to warn us about them? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=208.72s)]
*  If Kamala won, he wouldn't have warned us about anything. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=213.08s)]
*  Biden doesn't care about a tech oligarchy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  You don't even know what it means. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=218.84s)]
*  But he does understand revenge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  Democrats had big tech in their pockets since the Obama years, using them to cancel Trump, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=223.6s)]
*  deep six the laptop and buy off the battlegrounds. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  You weren't even allowed to crack Fauci jokes on their platforms. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=231.46s)]
*  But after Biden bombed at the debate and they cut off donations and open the door for Pelosi [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=235.16s)]
*  to plunge the knife. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=240.28s)]
*  Are these guys loyal? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=242.04s)]
*  Are they legit? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=244.24s)]
*  Or do they just want to be in bed with the winning team? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=245.24s)]
*  Mosk has a little more street cred than the others because he stuck his neck out when [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=248.56s)]
*  there was risk. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=252.48s)]
*  But I don't know about the rest of this crew. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe they're libertarians, maybe they're libs, maybe they're imperialists. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=255.72s)]
*  What do I know? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=259.0s)]
*  But I do know Biden wants blood. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=260.24s)]
*  He's declaring a war on the tech industrial complex and using it as a rallying cry for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=263.14s)]
*  the new resistance. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=268.12s)]
*  He's telling his party to ditch the E.I. and wage class warfare against the tech giants. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  I almost saw the speech as an attempt to wrestle back the mantle of populism from the Republicans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump has run a populist campaign and that's a lot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=282.04s)]
*  He's the outsider. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=285.68s)]
*  And what Joe Biden last night did was quite interesting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  Almost tried to reclaim populism for the Democratic Party. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  Spending a decade calling Trump Hitler blew up in the Democrats' faces. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=293.48s)]
*  They lost their base, donors and the plot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=297.14000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats have come to the end of a nine year messaging program during which they woke [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=300.6s)]
*  up every single day and told America and the world that Donald Trump was a bad guy because [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  he's an authoritarian, he's a racist, he's a sexual predator, he's a fascist, he's all [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=312.24s)]
*  these horrible things that they say about him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=316.92s)]
*  And what was the end result? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=319.98s)]
*  He won. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=321.26000000000005s)]
*  He got elected to the presidency again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  This has got to be regarded as the greatest communication failure in the history of world [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  politics. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  A nine year campaign that failed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  So Biden's trying to rebrand Democrats as a party for the people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=334.24s)]
*  But actions speak louder than words. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=338.12s)]
*  You got three people on top. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=341.04s)]
*  Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos and Mr. Zuckerberg who are now worth almost a trillion dollars. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=344.04s)]
*  Would you agree with President Biden who last night stated and I quote, an oligarchy is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that threatens our entire democracy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=358.44s)]
*  The three billionaires who you listed that all made the money themselves. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=365.44s)]
*  Mr. Musk came to the country as an immigrant. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=374.64s)]
*  Forget how they made their money. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=377.44s)]
*  Do you think that when so few people have so much wealth and so much economic and political [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=379.32s)]
*  power that that is an oligarchy forms a society? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=384.52s)]
*  I would note that the President Biden gave the presidential medal of freedom to two people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=388.84s)]
*  who I think would qualify for his oligarchs. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Biden gave the medal of freedom to George Soros and Mike Bloomberg. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=398.64s)]
*  He only likes the billionaires who work for him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=401.76s)]
*  And Democrats use mob rule to bully these CEOs to their side. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=404.5s)]
*  If you said what Democrats didn't want to hear, you're canceled. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  Even if it's the truth, you're canceled. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=412.12s)]
*  But that's over now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=414.44s)]
*  It's hot speech winter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=416.12s)]
*  CEOs can say what they want and support whoever they want without getting whacked. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=417.84s)]
*  And they don't have to pretend to like DEI anymore. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Look at these blue chip companies ditching DEI. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  A few years ago, if you didn't have a diversity officer or tampons in the men's room, your [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=428.28s)]
*  company would get boycotted. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=432.64s)]
*  Now you get dinner with the president. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=434.52s)]
*  And Trump's a talker. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  He is world class on real estate and on communications. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  And those are sort of his foundational skills. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=444.56s)]
*  And he's world class on both, which is like probably the first person in the world to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=446.12s)]
*  be world class on both of those things, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=449.32s)]
*  The real estate industry is not historically known for its great communicators. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=452.0s)]
*  Here you've got somebody who does both of those things incredibly well. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=455.88s)]
*  47 speaks to something inside successful competitive men. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=458.88s)]
*  They like what he does and they like that he says what he wants. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  And they like his drive and his finesse when there's an obstacle. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=468.0s)]
*  And when you see a man survive a gunshot and pop back up, that's respect. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=471.72s)]
*  Men want to be around men like that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=475.68s)]
*  And now they're not intimidated by their HR departments. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=477.6s)]
*  They're the boss. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=480.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, all these CEOs really care about is their bottom line. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=481.52s)]
*  Banks are seeing big profits because companies are optimistic about the economy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=486.68s)]
*  CEOs all over the planet are looking to finance big ticket investments here in America. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=491.16s)]
*  That's good news for everyone. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=495.76s)]
*  And for Trump to modernize the country and shred Biden's legacy, he's going to need [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  corporate America on his side. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=502.24s)]
*  If we're going to fight trade wars, we're going to have to re-industrialize. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=504.76000000000005s)]
*  If we're going to capitalize on AI, we're going to need to produce much more energy [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=508.44s)]
*  here at home. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=513.12s)]
*  And we're going to need young American workers to step up and fight for the American dream. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=514.72s)]
*  So we're cautiously optimistic about Big Tech's newfound loyalty. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  They're saying all the right things, but it's early. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  These people might just go where the wind blows. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=526.68s)]
*  And if they want our trust, they have to earn it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=529.5999999999999s)]
*  Because we can always bust up these big monopolies if they stomp all over our constitutional [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=532.64s)]
*  rights again. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  And tonight, another round of confirmation hearings and another round of humiliation [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=539.28s)]
*  for Democrats that just make them fools of themselves every day. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=543.9799999999999s)]
*  Across town at the White House, even more public shame for Democrats after a mumbling, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  delusional farewell address from Joe Biden that no one, I promise you, will ever remember. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=553.64s)]
*  Our dear friend, Stephen A. Smith, called it sad. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=559.32s)]
*  And apparently, he now regrets voting for Kamala Harris. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=562.42s)]
*  Why didn't he listen to me in the beginning? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=566.16s)]
*  I'll ask him in just a moment. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=567.84s)]
*  But let's be clear. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=569.84s)]
*  Stephen A. is not the only Democratic voter with regrets. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=570.84s)]
*  Joe Biden is leaving office with a record low approval rating, a vast majority of you, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=574.04s)]
*  The American people believe his presidency was a failure. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=580.08s)]
*  It was. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  And today, he needed a lot of help just walking into a room. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=585.1600000000001s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=589.88s)]
*  It's humiliating. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=590.88s)]
*  What a terrible end to a terrible four years. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  And tragically, his biggest failure will likely be felt years to come as all of his unvetted, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=594.88s)]
*  illegal immigrants continue to commit murders and rapes and other violent crimes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  And the known terrorist that he has allowed into our country continue to plot, plan, scheme [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=608.64s)]
*  and attack on our homeland. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=613.76s)]
*  I pray to God that this never happens, but it probably will. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=616.0s)]
*  The odds are very high. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=620.16s)]
*  And when it does, the blood will be on Joe's hands, Kamala's hands, Mayorca's hands, and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=621.8s)]
*  frankly, all of the other law enforcement that turned a blind eye not to enforce the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=628.52s)]
*  law. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=633.28s)]
*  And I'm not talking about rank-and-file members of law enforcement. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=634.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump has never been more popular. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=637.52s)]
*  Recent Fox News polls showing a majority of Americans approving of Donald Trump's transition. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=640.24s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=645.88s)]
*  Once scorned by much of the corporate world, business leaders are now lining up to meet [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=647.08s)]
*  with Donald Trump, donate big dollars to his inauguration. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=651.86s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump's inaugural committee is now breaking records with donations from [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=655.16s)]
*  almost every major company in the country. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=660.16s)]
*  It's a new reality. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=663.72s)]
*  Democrats, the media mob. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=665.28s)]
*  They never saw this coming. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, is Donald, it's Donald Trump that is uniting the country. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  And needless to say, many on the left, they're not happy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  This is their worst nightmare, becoming their reality. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=678.4799999999999s)]
*  Apparently, 84-year-old, 20-term swamp monster, Nancy Pelosi, she can't bear, oh, the vapors. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=681.76s)]
*  Oh, she can't handle it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=689.68s)]
*  She's not going to be attending Trump's inauguration. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody will care. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  Neither will Michelle Obama. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  According to reports, she has a very bad case of Trump derangement syndrome and is so filled [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=697.16s)]
*  with hate, she is refusing to go. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  Does anybody really care? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=705.4s)]
*  I know I don't. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=706.5999999999999s)]
*  The Trump team, they don't seem too bothered either. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  They are reportedly having a good laugh at her expense. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  And of course, no one is really surprised by Michelle Obama's behavior. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=713.92s)]
*  According to Melania Trump, this is very revealing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  The Obamas were not exactly helpful or courteous during the first transition to the White House [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=721.24s)]
*  in 2017. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=728.2s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Behind the scenes, what is it like when you're moving back in the White House? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  Are you, what's different this time? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=734.2s)]
*  The difference is I know where I will be going. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  I know the rooms where we will be living. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=739.6s)]
*  I know the process. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  The first time was challenging. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=744.2s)]
*  We didn't have much of the information. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=746.42s)]
*  The information was upheld for us from previous administration. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=749.32s)]
*  But this time I have everything. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=756.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=758.08s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, we are witnessing history. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=759.08s)]
*  This was a historic political victory, perhaps the biggest in the country's history, and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  only made possible, and we need to stop and pause and thank all of you, the American people. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=769.72s)]
*  The cards, they were absolutely stacked against Donald Trump. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  He had the deep state against him, Pig Keck, a weaponized DOJ, the media mob, academia, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=778.96s)]
*  all the Democratic Party, all tried to destroy him. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=785.12s)]
*  After nine straight years of lying and slander and character assassination, he prevailed. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=789.34s)]
*  And now Americans of all different backgrounds, they are waking up, they are realizing they [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=795.76s)]
*  have been lied to by Democrats, they have been lied to by the legacy media, they have [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=800.1600000000001s)]

*  Now, our friend Stephen A. Smith even admits he was misinformed about the 2024 election. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=809.84s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  And I did not vote for Donald Trump, unlike people that suddenly turned around and kissing [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=817.12s)]
*  his ring and, you know, trying to feign like they're suddenly a supporter of his. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=821.72s)]
*  No, I did not vote for him, but I got to tell you something. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=826.84s)]
*  I'm not Maddie Warren. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=830.48s)]
*  Let's call it what it is. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=832.48s)]
*  Because a lot of people that won't admit this, I'm going to admit it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=834.32s)]
*  I was a bit misinformed. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  Let's call it what it is. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=841.96s)]
*  And that pressure emanating from my community, I'm tired of it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=844.6s)]

*  Here's the truth. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=859.48s)]
*  might have been a better candidate than her mentally inept, cognitively declining boss, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=861.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, but she would have been a terrible president. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=866.32s)]
*  She's far more radical left than Joe. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=869.36s)]
*  We pointed that out. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=871.4s)]
*  Very few people wanted to report on it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=872.64s)]
*  The legacy media ignored it all. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=874.52s)]
*  They were all in on all things Kamala Harris. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=876.72s)]
*  They never vetted her. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=880.12s)]
*  And that's why people don't trust them anymore. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  That's why she was a terrible vice president. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=884.2s)]
*  That's why she was not a good border czar. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=887.12s)]
*  A terrible senator and frankly not a good lawyer or prosecutor. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=889.4s)]
*  And now like so many other losers, you know, and far left lawyers, she's reportedly planning [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=893.08s)]
*  a New York city lifestyle and cashing in on a book deal that probably few people will [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  be interested in and likely to purchase. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  But according to, well, the ever giggling vice president, she is refusing to go quietly [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=908.72s)]
*  into the night. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  I would advise her to reconsider. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=915.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=917.72s)]
*  As you all have heard me say many times, I am fully aware that I am the public face of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=919.08s)]
*  a lot of our work. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I have the benefit of running into people all over our country who thank me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=927.36s)]
*  And I will tell you, I am fully aware that when they are thanking me, they are thanking [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=933.6s)]
*  our team and our work is not done. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=938.26s)]
*  And as you all know me, because we have spent long hours, long days and months and years [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=942.36s)]
*  together, it is not my nature to go quietly into the night. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=947.64s)]
*  So don't worry about that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  She's going to move back to the community where she will live in a community of people [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=955.76s)]
*  that share a community for the community's sake. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=961.04s)]
*  Despite all these words about herself, it is safe to say Kamala Harris's political career [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=965.24s)]
*  is over. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  Although I will say this, she has a very good chance of being California's next governor. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  She fit right in in California. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=975.4s)]
*  Now, we just hope she can be unburdened by what has been. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=977.6s)]
*  So yesterday was an ugly day in D.C. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  And if there was ever a beauty in the beast moment in the halls of Congress, Pam Bondi's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=983.8s)]
*  confirmation hearing was it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  Bondi, hold on, stop it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=991.88s)]
*  Bondi, Donald Trump's nominee for A.G., found herself facing the swamp's resident bug-eyed [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=996.68s)]
*  monster. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1003.6s)]
*  Have a look if you dare. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1004.6s)]
*  Are you aware of any factual basis to investigate Liz Cheney? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1007.0999999999999s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1010.9s)]
*  Senator, that's a hypothetical and I'm not going to answer that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1011.9s)]
*  I'm also worried about Liz Cheney, Senator. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1015.0999999999999s)]
*  You know what we should be worried about? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1017.0999999999999s)]
*  Ms. Bondi, please answer my questions. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1019.0999999999999s)]
*  The primary in California right now is the word of the roof. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1021.0999999999999s)]
*  Senator, what I can tell you is I will never play politics. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1023.0999999999999s)]
*  You're trying to engage me in a gotcha. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1026.98s)]
*  I won't play politics with any ongoing investigation. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1029.22s)]
*  Like you did leaking your colleague Devin Nunes' memo. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1033.62s)]
*  I'm not going to mislead this body nor you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1037.62s)]
*  You were censured by Congress, Senator, for comments just like this that are so reckless. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1041.62s)]
*  Well, that was useful. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1046.62s)]
*  But Adam's got a face only a mother could love. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1048.62s)]
*  Norman Bates' mother. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1052.62s)]
*  Because not only is this guy lying bozo, he's also weird looking. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1056.62s)]
*  But aren't they all? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1061.62s)]
*  The Dems are the homeliest bunch since Kiss decided to take off their makeup. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1062.62s)]
*  Now consider the people they attack. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1068.62s)]
*  When you look at Bondi, Hegseth, Kristi Noem, RFK, Michael Kratzio, Scott Turner, even John Ratcliffe, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1070.62s)]
*  three words come to mind. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1077.62s)]
*  Va, va, vroom. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1079.62s)]
*  Kelly Loeffler is a walking advertisement for Herbal Essence. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1082.62s)]
*  Sean Duffy, you don't have nine kids by being a four. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1088.62s)]
*  And it wasn't climate change that was making Chris Wright's protesters hot. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1095.62s)]
*  No siree. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1099.62s)]
*  And when you hear women yelling Marco at the pool, it's not Polo thereafter. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1101.62s)]
*  Tulsi hasn't even shown up yet, am I right? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1107.62s)]
*  Then there's Doug Burgum, whose brooding sexiness is bringing chocula back to the supermarkets. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1110.62s)]
*  And what of Stephen Miller, huh? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1123.62s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1126.62s)]
*  How is he hot? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1127.62s)]
*  Well, check out his wife. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1129.62s)]
*  See, he benefits from secondhand hotness. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1131.62s)]
*  He just went from a three to a six. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1137.62s)]
*  By comparison, the Dems seem like a parade of slovenly before pictures. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1139.62s)]
*  I mean, even the guy grilling Hegseth about drinking, he looked like, look at him. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1145.62s)]
*  I mean, he looks like he just got into a boozy fight with a leaf blower. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1152.62s)]
*  But if you hung out with Bill Clinton for 30 years, you'd look like that too. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1158.62s)]
*  So why the difference? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1162.62s)]
*  Well, the mind and body are one thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1164.62s)]
*  How many of us feel crappy mentally when we treat our bodies poorly, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1167.62s)]
*  when we don't work out or we eat bad food or we take a pill handed to you by Larry Kudlow outside a Tijuana brothel? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1172.62s)]
*  And conversely, how many of us feel physically sick when we treat our minds badly, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1181.62s)]
*  filling it with defeatist beliefs, victim mentality, or one of Jesse's books? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1187.62s)]
*  You cannot embrace victimhood and still look hot. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1195.62s)]
*  I mean, imagine me whining with this jawline. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1199.62s)]
*  But if your soul is rotten, your teeth will follow. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1204.62s)]
*  Truth is, conservatives think there are things worth protecting, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1207.62s)]
*  and that starts with taking care of how they look and feel. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1210.62s)]
*  But leftism is about denigrating standards so that we're all one big blob of steaming hippo s***. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1213.62s)]
*  And so we get plus-sized cover girls, prom queens with beards, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1221.62s)]
*  and paintings that look like my bathroom wall the last time I ate Taco Bell. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1225.62s)]
*  In fact, ugly is rewarded by Democrats who view sex appeal as hot privilege. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1232.62s)]
*  Take San Diego State University, where students are told that fat phobia is rooted in racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other oppression, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1238.62s)]
*  and calls on students to champion fat bodies. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1247.62s)]
*  Yeah, right, because it's the bigots who are forcing the oppressed to deep throw to ding-dong. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1251.62s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1259.62s)]
*  The Post urges students to read books by fat liberationists. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1260.62s)]
*  And what are those books? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1266.62s)]
*  For Whom the Dinner Bell Tolls? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1268.62s)]
*  The Great Fatsby? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1271.62s)]
*  The Count of Monte Crisco? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1274.62s)]
*  The Lord of the Onion Rings? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1277.62s)]
*  You know, I'll wait for the movie. There's probably a love scene at Golden Corral. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1281.62s)]
*  So listen, San Diego, if you're fat, fat and queer, fat whatever, you'll feel a hell of a lot better if you work on what God gave you, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1285.62s)]
*  a body which includes your mind. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1291.62s)]
*  Hell, have even more pride parades, but walk it this time instead of being the float. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1294.62s)]
*  And I get it, it's harder to be fit. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1299.62s)]
*  So labeling anyone a bigot means you don't have to work out. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1302.62s)]
*  Hell, it worked for this sack of donuts. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1305.62s)]
*  But it's not about weight. It's the victim mindset. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1308.62s)]
*  You lose that and the pounds come off. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1312.62s)]
*  That's a message those San Diego students never hear. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1314.62s)]
*  Instead, the left limits your aspirations by putting you in the boxes of race, gender, and sexual orientation. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1318.62s)]
*  It's why your once cute niece came home at Christmas break with a shaved head and hairy pits. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1325.62s)]
*  Her fresh-faced beauty had to be ruined for it's a reminder of patriarchal aspirations. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1330.62s)]
*  So I'm not saying all Democrats are unattractive. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1336.62s)]
*  Some of their women are attractive, even the ones with d***. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1340.62s)]
*  But the truth is, being ugly inside can make you ugly outside. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1351.62s)]
*  And when you compare the parties, just no contest. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1355.62s)]
*  Is Christie known compared to Alejandro Mayorkas? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1358.62s)]
*  I mean, let's just say shooting a dog in the head wouldn't be a deal breaker. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1361.62s)]
*  And I have to repeat two words. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1370.62s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1372.62s)]
*  He's like Brad Pitt with more kids. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1374.62s)]
*  Now who in D.C. is going to look better than that guy? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1377.62s)]
*  Obviously no one, since I called off my Senate run. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1380.62s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1384.62s)]
*  She used to be an attorney, now she puts liberals on a gurney. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1388.62s)]
*  Goes about never getting a link of on you. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1392.62s)]
*  He's so funny, the audience forgets to laugh. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1396.62s)]
*  Comedian Dave Landau. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1399.62s)]
*  She can't wait to deliver her baby so she can go back to eating mercury. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1404.62s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, Bob Seuss, contributor, Cat Doo. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1409.62s)]
*  And he describes the Grand Canyon as the OK Canyon. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1412.62s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian, and former NWA World Champion Tyrus. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1416.62s)]
*  Emily, Emily, Emily, are you a Republican because you're beautiful? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1424.62s)]
*  Or are you beautiful because you're Republican? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1430.62s)]
*  Like, I could never see you as a leftist. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1434.62s)]
*  You're too hot to be a leftist. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1436.62s)]
*  I'm waiting for you to make a terrible comment about me after that. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1438.62s)]
*  Because you never say something like that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1442.62s)]
*  I was going to bring up the fact that you're not wearing pants. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1444.62s)]
*  The audience can see that. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1446.62s)]
*  Subway. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1448.62s)]
*  I loved what you said about the whole point is that when you are corroded on the inside, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1450.62s)]
*  then it shows up on the outside. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1456.62s)]
*  I mean, I think truly there are a few ugly people I've seen in my life, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1458.62s)]
*  and it was so funny. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1462.62s)]
*  And it is shocking to me how that party writ large has the horrors of our present day [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1464.62s)]
*  written all over those outside packages. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1470.62s)]
*  By the way, San Diego State, when I was 16 years old, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1474.62s)]
*  I forged my birth certificate at a local Kinko's and hopped along with the, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1478.62s)]
*  I won't name it, a certain fraternity there at San Diego State, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1484.62s)]
*  and we all crossed the border down to Mexico where we spent the rest of our lives. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1487.62s)]
*  We all crossed the border down to Mexico where we spent a spring break there in Mexico [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1491.62s)]
*  partying like it was 1999, which was a couple years before that, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1496.62s)]
*  and it was literally the best, most amazing party ever. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1500.62s)]
*  Thank you, Mexico. Thank you, San Diego State. Thank you, that fraternity. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1503.62s)]
*  And the point is how quickly it changes, how quickly the infection and the victim mindset [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1506.62s)]
*  and the toxins, the tumor that is, that narrative rotted the brains there. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1515.62s)]
*  And now I don't recognize San Diego State. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1520.62s)]
*  That's what your college year should be for, right? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1522.62s)]
*  What education, like true education. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1524.62s)]
*  And now it's unrecognizable, like that whole party, because they are vessels of tar. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1526.62s)]
*  You know, that's what college should be, partying with a 16-year-old Emily Campagno in Mexico. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1533.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1541.62s)]
*  What could go wrong? What could go wrong? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1543.62s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1545.62s)]
*  I didn't know she was 16. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1547.62s)]
*  Dave, you seem like the picture of health. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1549.62s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1552.62s)]
*  Let's talk about eating healthy and not being dead inside. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1554.62s)]
*  Comedians, they can't, it's like it goes against brand to be fit, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1559.62s)]
*  except you're seeing it with the Rogan contingent, all these guys lifting weights. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1563.62s)]
*  I don't like comedians though to be muscular. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1569.62s)]
*  No, I like them to look just like this. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1571.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1574.62s)]
*  Short and obese, as my doctor calls it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1575.62s)]
*  Don't you hate that? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1579.62s)]
*  Yeah, like you're pre-diabetic. It's like, so I'm not. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1580.62s)]
*  You should say it like you're pre-approved. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1587.62s)]
*  Yes, you're going well. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1589.62s)]
*  I feel like I look better than half of the other side though. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1591.62s)]
*  When you look at the left, like Adam Schiff, I mean Trump took a bullet for this country. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1593.62s)]
*  Schiff looks like he's always sitting on a vibrating one. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1597.62s)]
*  Too much? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1603.62s)]
*  No, not enough. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1604.62s)]
*  Well, and Kane looks like a mad scientist that moonlights in a Neil Diamond cover band. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1607.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1611.62s)]
*  Just a creep. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1612.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's something wrong with him and I don't know what it is. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1613.62s)]
*  It's something. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1616.62s)]
*  And Rob Wieden, I mean some of these, I don't know, maybe there's something wrong with him, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1617.62s)]
*  so I don't want to make fun of them. I'll just do that in the break. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1621.62s)]
*  Kat, I know this is an incredibly shallow segment, but I embrace shallowness. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1626.62s)]
*  And let's be honest, we've talked about this. We are bigoted against certain types of people, aren't we, Kat? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1631.62s)]
*  Yeah, except now I'm super fat and I'm still hot. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1639.62s)]
*  You know, I'm going to compliment you here. In the 1970s, well before the internet, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1648.62s)]
*  you could buy Hot and Pregnant magazine, right? It was always behind the counter at 7th and Lyman. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1652.62s)]
*  So am I, Noah's. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1657.62s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1658.62s)]
*  Well, you would be on the cover, Hot and Pregnant. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1659.62s)]
*  I hope her career choices would say no. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1665.62s)]
*  I don't know. It is, honestly, I mean, okay, the idea that there's no hot liberal, I mean, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1668.62s)]
*  Hollywood is full of hot liberal people. Also, to me, I often think ugly people are hot [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1675.62s)]
*  because they're more interesting to look at. Like if you got some f***ed up teeth or something, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1681.62s)]
*  that's hot to me. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1686.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1687.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it took me a while actually to be attracted to my husband [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1688.62s)]
*  just because his teeth are too nice. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1692.62s)]
*  I remember you trying... [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1694.62s)]
*  I'm like, not one missing? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1695.62s)]
*  You were trying to get him to do meth. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1697.62s)]
*  I was like, I was hiding his toothbrush for years. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1699.62s)]
*  No, I mean, it's true because I think hot is subjective and my friends are always like, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1704.62s)]
*  Kat, you just don't know how to tell if people are hot or not, and they may have a point. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1708.62s)]
*  But I think also, I mean, obviously people a lot of times are miserable, they're miserable [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1711.62s)]
*  and they take it out on other people, and if you're ugly, sometimes you're more miserable. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1715.62s)]
*  You just have to realize you're not ugly, you just haven't found the right weirdo yet. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1719.62s)]
*  That is true. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1724.62s)]
*  Because if you have confidence, it's hot. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1725.62s)]
*  Yeah, everybody, if you can find somebody who doesn't care what they look like, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1727.62s)]
*  but you know, takes care of themselves. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1731.62s)]
*  That is the key, Tyrus. Tyrus, you've always been interested in fitness. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1733.62s)]
*  Isn't it about, you can see somebody who's got a system for fitness and assume from that [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1737.62s)]
*  they probably have a system for other things. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1742.62s)]
*  Well, it depends. If they're obsessed, then all they worry about is fitness, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1744.62s)]
*  and then when you talk to them, you say they need to get back to the gym [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1749.62s)]
*  because that's the only place they, you got to have balance. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1753.62s)]
*  You got to be able to go both ways. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1756.62s)]
*  And one of the things that we saw from Shift was balance, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1757.62s)]
*  because he was trying to find a way to ask, are you going to investigate me? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1762.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1768.62s)]
*  Like that's all that was about. He's like, I'd like to ask a couple questions. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1769.62s)]
*  So you're just going to have a blanket pardon for everybody that we went after. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1772.62s)]
*  But like, are you going to go after Cheney? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1778.62s)]
*  And if she said, yeah, then he's the next question would have been like, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1781.62s)]
*  but I just wrote it. I didn't because you remember he writes movie scripts. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1785.62s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not and they had a what movie director do the six. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1791.62s)]
*  And now we're finding about all these little FBI agents that were running around. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1795.62s)]
*  So Shift was trying to ask questions that every criminal, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1799.62s)]
*  it's like, you know, your wife knows what you did. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1804.62s)]
*  You can't come out and say, honey, that underwear is mine. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1807.62s)]
*  You have to say, did you find anything unusual this week, dear? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1812.62s)]
*  She's like, yes, zucchini was up six cents in the market. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1819.62s)]
*  OK, that's great. No, was there anything in the house particularly off? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1821.62s)]
*  Yeah, the light was off in the other room. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1826.62s)]
*  Are you sure there's nothing because he doesn't want to admit what he knows is coming. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1828.62s)]
*  He was trying to get her in a situation where he could say, see, she's coming after us. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1832.62s)]
*  She's waiting because she kept saying a very interesting thing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1836.62s)]
*  She says, I have staff. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1839.62s)]
*  So we'll go through 100 cases and we'll look at the ongoing investigation. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1842.62s)]
*  And that's what made Shift very unhappy because his ass is all caught up in the ongoing investigation. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1847.62s)]
*  And might I add a flat ass. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5W9uadzi_A&t=1853.62s)]
