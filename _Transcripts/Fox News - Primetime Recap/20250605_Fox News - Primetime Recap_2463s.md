# Fox News Highlights - June 4th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s)
*  First, KJP's S.O.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Another day, another liberal hocking a book, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=7.16s)]
*  claiming to be disillusioned now by the Democrat party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=9.96s)]
*  Now, this time, it's not just a lefty TV [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=14.44s)]
*  and print personality type claiming to be shocked [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=16.8s)]
*  by Biden's decline and the cover-up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=19.48s)]
*  It's the woman who helped the Biden White House [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=22.36s)]
*  sell its fiction day after day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=25.12s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever, as I have known him to be [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=28.16s)]
*  in my engagement, in my experience with him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=31.32s)]
*  Does the president have the stamina, physically and mentally, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=34.48s)]
*  do you think to continue on even after 2024? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=37.4s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, he's the president of the United States. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=41.04s)]
*  You know, he, I can't even keep up with him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=43.84s)]
*  There's been no cover-up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  Want to be very clear about that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=48.16s)]
*  No cover-up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=50.2s)]
*  But now, trying to cash in on her time at the podium, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  KJP claims to have had an epiphany of sorts, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=55.04s)]
*  which led to her switch from being a Democrat [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=59.2s)]
*  to being an independent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=61.8s)]
*  And naturally, she posted something on Instagram [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=63.6s)]
*  with the predictable windup. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=68.16s)]
*  In an era of misinformation, disinformation, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=70.88s)]
*  the regressiveness of social policy, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=73.56s)]
*  what we're seeing currently right now, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  what I have decided to do, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=78.44s)]
*  and I really have thought long and hard about this, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=80.12s)]
*  is to follow my own compass. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=83.04s)]
*  And that's what I've done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Misinform, wait, disinformation, is that what she said? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=88.72s)]
*  Again, this coming from a woman who for two years [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=92.76s)]
*  was actively misleading America [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=95.28s)]
*  on critical issues facing the country. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=97.64s)]
*  It would be wrong to think that the border is open. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=100.28s)]
*  It is not open. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  Is there any possibility [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=104.56s)]
*  that the president would end up pardoning his son? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=106.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  I think you all have called this the cheap fakes video, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=109.48s)]
*  and that's exactly what they are. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=112.12s)]
*  They are cheap fakes video. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  They are done in bad faith. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  As the president said earlier today, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  his unwavering focus is on continuing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=118.68s)]
*  to lower costs for families, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=121.68s)]
*  and that's gonna be our focus. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=123.12s)]
*  We're gonna continue to do that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=124.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's all disgraceful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  And another question, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  did she know anything about the auto pen? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=130.0s)]
*  And how could she have possibly had no sense, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=133.52s)]
*  no sense whatsoever, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=136.24s)]
*  no sense at all about Biden's condition? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=137.96s)]
*  No one is buying this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=141.0s)]
*  Oh, and I have a cliche alert. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=143.0s)]
*  And here's the truth, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=145.56s)]
*  and here's how I will lay it out to you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=146.96s)]
*  I think we need to stop thinking in boxes [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=149.44s)]
*  and think outside of our boxes and not be so partisan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=152.76s)]
*  This book, Independent, it's about looking outside of boxes, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=157.28s)]
*  not just always being in a partisan stance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=161.52s)]
*  Oh, without that binder, she's lost. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=167.08s)]
*  Wait, think outside the box? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=169.56s)]
*  Never heard that line. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=172.36s)]
*  That's so smart. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=173.24s)]
*  And don't be so partisan? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=175.16s)]
*  Again, those are hollow words coming from someone [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=177.4s)]
*  who never failed to be viciously partisan herself. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=179.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have seen mega, mega Republican officials [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  who don't believe in the rule of law. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  We are hearing from mega Republican officials, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=190.32s)]
*  extreme Republican officials, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=194.24s)]
*  who say that they are not going to accept this election [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  is a threat to our democracy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=198.92s)]
*  Now, in fact, her partisanship was so bad [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=201.44s)]
*  that a government watchdog found [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=204.2s)]
*  that she had violated the Hatch Act. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=206.2s)]
*  She even received an official warning about that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=209.2s)]
*  So when you take away the woman's binder again, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=212.96s)]
*  she's an empty pantsuit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=215.0s)]
*  Honestly, who cares that she's switching parties? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=217.04s)]
*  It means nothing to anyone, doesn't change anything. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=219.44s)]
*  But we're supposed to believe that she was a committed Dem [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=222.72s)]
*  until she walked out of the White House on January 20th, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  that she had to think long and hard about this, as she said. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Of course, had she had her reawakening [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=233.88s)]
*  while Biden was still in office, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  she'd be on slightly firmer ground here, slightly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=238.28s)]
*  At least then she would have been risking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  something professionally, but instead, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  she consistently just brushed off legitimate questions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  Is anyone in the White House hiding information [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  about the president's health or his ability [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=251.92s)]
*  to do the job day to day? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  What we have provided has been very transparent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=256.52s)]
*  Does President Biden, at 81 years old, have Alzheimer's, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=259.0s)]
*  any form of dementia or degenerative illness [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=263.96s)]
*  that may cause these sorts of lapses? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=268.2s)]
*  And it's a yes or no question. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a no. There are growing calls from Democrats, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  including members of Congress, for the president [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=275.84s)]
*  to step aside for the 2024 election [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=278.12s)]
*  because he's not capable of serving another four years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=280.44s)]
*  What is his response to this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=283.36s)]
*  He knows how to do the job, not because he says it, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=284.72s)]
*  because his record proves it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden is A-OK, she said. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=289.8s)]
*  But that was then, when she still held out hope [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  that Biden's fixers could handle the situation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=296.0s)]
*  and save his candidacy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=299.12s)]
*  But now she's a private citizen, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  like many former press secretaries, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  she may want to join a television network [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=304.6s)]
*  or sit on corporate boards. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  And let's face it, she's a lot more attractive [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=309.6s)]
*  as a potential hire if she's a reasonable liberal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=311.44s)]
*  than a former mouthpiece for a one-term president [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=315.16s)]
*  cast off by his own party. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=317.88s)]
*  Now, look, some of the post-Hawk Biden critiques [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=320.36s)]
*  are very dishy, they feel a little zesty nuggets. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=323.04s)]
*  But I personally just don't put a lot of stock in any of this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=326.8s)]
*  If Biden had not blown that debate, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=330.32s)]
*  all of these people would have stuck with him, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=333.08s)]
*  despite what they knew, and you know they knew. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=335.88s)]
*  They were prepared to keep the fraud going [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=339.08s)]
*  as long as they possibly could. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=341.16s)]
*  His family, his fellow Democrats, and yeah, the media. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  But then fast forward to today. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  After November shellacking and recent polls, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  Democrats are scrambling. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=351.8s)]
*  They're sending up warning flares [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=354.16s)]
*  to alert the rest of the party. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=355.72s)]
*  Stop being weird. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  We're calling the Republicans weird, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  and we're the party that requires pronouns [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=361.88s)]
*  in your email signature. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=363.48s)]
*  We in the Democratic Party [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  swung the pendulum too far to the left. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  We lost because of inflation and immigration. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=369.0s)]
*  We saw a catastrophic mismanagement [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=372.12s)]
*  of the migrant crisis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=374.6s)]
*  The Biden administration had become [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=375.88s)]
*  ideologically captured by the far left. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=378.2s)]
*  Well, they're correct, but it's too little too late, in my view. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=381.08s)]
*  The party needs to moderate to attract young men [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=384.04s)]
*  and rural voters, no kidding. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=387.24s)]
*  But the question right now is can they? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=389.4s)]
*  Well, don't ask Crockett, who had a chain reaction. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=392.2s)]
*  Every little hate that they spew your way, my way, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=395.88s)]
*  it is because they know that they see [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  how beautiful we are inside and out, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  and we walk in that greatness every single day. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=404.44s)]
*  If they could, they would throw me back in chains. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=406.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  Somehow those that came before us [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=410.68s)]
*  managed to break loose of the physical chains, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=413.32s)]
*  even though we still have a bunch of systemic chains [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  that we are still kind of wrangling with. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=419.56s)]
*  Systemic chains. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=422.44s)]
*  Now, Kamala, you have competition [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=425.24s)]
*  in the word salad department. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=427.48s)]
*  She might have won. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=429.24s)]
*  Now, of course, it's true that some Democrats [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=431.16s)]
*  are searching for off-ramps or, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=432.92s)]
*  I think it's better to say, searching for lifeboats [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=436.12s)]
*  to escape the Titanic that their party has become. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  Because after four years of fraud and destruction, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=442.92s)]
*  their brand's in the toilet. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=445.72s)]
*  I think Democrats thought Americans were too stupid [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=448.44s)]
*  to believe their own eyes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=450.68s)]
*  We all saw. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  We saw what was happening. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=453.48s)]
*  And the angle documented it in excruciating detail. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=454.84s)]
*  Biden's stumbling and mumbling. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  We all knew it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=460.28s)]
*  And efforts to discount our concerns [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=461.88s)]
*  and attack us for raising them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=463.96s)]
*  It didn't just insult our intelligence, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=466.28s)]
*  your intelligence. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=468.28s)]
*  It helped keep the entire charade going. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=469.56s)]
*  So whoever was doing Joe's job [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=472.76s)]
*  screwed things up royally for the country. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=475.32s)]
*  Inflation spiked. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  Of course, the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  Gas prices way up. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  The flood of criminals. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=483.0s)]
*  People on the terror watch list. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=484.44s)]
*  Indigents who cross the border. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=486.28s)]
*  We're talking decades of damage [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=488.68s)]
*  that we're going to have to deal with as a nation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=491.0s)]
*  So Americans don't need another insider [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=493.96s)]
*  telling them what they knew three and a half years ago. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=496.2s)]
*  Especially an insider is intimately involved [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=498.68s)]
*  in selling the Biden lie day after day. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=501.56s)]
*  Americans aren't going to forget this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=504.92s)]
*  Their built-in lie detectors are going off. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=507.0s)]
*  Biden's first press secretary, Jen Psaki, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=510.76s)]
*  is finding that it's pretty hard [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=512.92s)]
*  to find an audience on MSNBC. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=514.8399999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=517.88s)]
*  Because like her successor, she lies a lot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=519.0s)]
*  I never saw that person, not a single time, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=523.88s)]
*  and I was in the Oval Office every day, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=527.0s)]
*  that was on that debate stage. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=529.4799999999999s)]
*  Then her CYA moment came. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=532.04s)]
*  I'm not a doctor. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=534.76s)]
*  Aging happens quite quickly. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=535.8s)]
*  Were things that people saw during that period of time [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=537.64s)]
*  that were similar to that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=540.28s)]
*  or would have been in a category of that? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=541.56s)]
*  I don't know, possibly, right? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  Aging happens quite quickly. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  But the lies weren't only about Biden's decline, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  but other things as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  She even had to edit out part of her book [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  about Biden's watch check at Dover Air Force Base. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=556.28s)]
*  And just like KJP, I think what happened was [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=560.04s)]
*  she maybe got so used to misrepresenting things [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=562.92s)]
*  that it became second nature to do so. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=565.88s)]
*  She couldn't even get the story straight [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  about the Biden family dog major. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=570.28s)]
*  The truth bites, Jen. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  She and KJP had different styles, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=576.6s)]
*  but the result was the same. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=579.0s)]
*  They were both at the forefront of the Biden cover-up, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  and their credibility is in tatters. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=584.52s)]
*  If Democrats are serious about an off-ramp to common sense, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=587.64s)]
*  they should leave these people in the rear view. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=591.64s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=595.0s)]
*  There's a giant lawn party at the White House tonight. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=597.64s)]
*  Nope, not Trump's birthday yet. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=600.52s)]
*  This was the summer soiree. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=602.6s)]
*  Think of a summer State of the Union [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  minus Pelosi and the Panacans. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Instead, 3,000 Trump staffers [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  and a whole lot of Stephen Miller. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=611.4s)]
*  And of course, 47. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=613.64s)]
*  We've never done this before. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=616.28s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=617.4s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  The previous administration wouldn't have thought of doing it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=622.68s)]
*  But we think we're going to do it for four more years. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, maybe eight more years. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=629.48s)]
*  Six months ago, we had a nation that was as cold as ice. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=632.6s)]
*  It was cold. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=635.96s)]
*  The whole world was laughing at us. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=637.16s)]
*  And they're not laughing anymore, that I can tell you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=639.88s)]
*  Now, because of the people here tonight, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=642.2s)]
*  we have the hottest, most talked-about country anywhere in the world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=644.76s)]
*  The party was sponsored by McDonald's and Anheuser-Busch, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=649.72s)]
*  which I guess means you and I, the taxpayers, we didn't pay for it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=653.96s)]
*  They did. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=657.24s)]
*  The menu? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=658.28s)]
*  Quarter pounders and beer. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=659.16s)]
*  And the Navy band performing, quote, classic songs. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=660.92s)]
*  The country deserves a soiree after what Biden did to it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=664.6s)]
*  Biden's last White House party, Pride flags and trans flashers. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=667.72s)]
*  Can't forget about Juneteenth, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=671.8s)]
*  the night AutoPen froze in front of the world. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=673.8s)]
*  Washington's under renovation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=676.92s)]
*  Even if you're nasty, you still have a seat at the soiree. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=679.24s)]
*  If you're a reporter, a White House reporter in D.C., [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=682.68s)]
*  and you are going to be really adversarial and tough, but fair, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  on Trump, you get, like, snaps all across town. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=691.56s)]
*  You get invited to, like, every single garden party and book party imaginable. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=694.12s)]
*  But if you do it, you know, with Biden or even with Obama, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=698.3599999999999s)]

*  One exception, if you don't acknowledge the Gulf of America, you're out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=709.0s)]
*  Those are the rules. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=712.92s)]
*  JD has another rule. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  Don't be an ignorant academic. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=716.12s)]
*  There are politicians out there who are, they've just been politicians. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=718.68s)]
*  You are someone who was an intellectual first. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=724.04s)]
*  Some people don't like the word intellectual, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  but I mean it in the good sense of the term. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=728.68s)]
*  You were writing for National Review. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=731.4s)]
*  I come here for free and you insult me and you call me an intellectual. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=732.92s)]

*  But most people want in on the fun, even the ones you'd never suspect, like the binder, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=739.32s)]
*  the official mouthpiece of the Biden White House. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=747.72s)]
*  Binder has some breaking news. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=751.08s)]
*  She's transitioning and adopting new pronouns. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  She's indie. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=756.84s)]
*  Hi, I'm Corrine Jean-Pierre and I am the author of a new book [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  that's coming out this fall called Independent. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  It's coming out on October 21st, so please, please do grab it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  And the reason I wrote this book coming out of the White House, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=768.76s)]
*  serving as White House Press Secretary was an honor and a privilege. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=773.4s)]
*  But since I have left, the people that come up to me, strangers that come up to me [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  just across the country as I'm traveling and sometimes right in my neighborhood [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=782.76s)]
*  at a grocery store, supermarket, airport, my daughter's school, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  the number one question they ask me is, Corrine, how do we get out of this? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=791.0s)]
*  How do we protect our democracy? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=795.0s)]
*  How do we protect vulnerable communities among us? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=797.0s)]
*  Binder shopping for sweet potatoes at the grocery store [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=800.04s)]
*  and customers are asking her about vulnerable communities. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=802.52s)]
*  How about binder, who controlled the auto pen? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=806.44s)]
*  Did you know he had cancer? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=809.16s)]
*  Did he really get lost in the closet? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=810.92s)]
*  Binder spent two years lying from a podium and now she wants to tell us the truth? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=813.64s)]
*  Look at the name of the book, Inside a Broken White House. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=818.84s)]
*  Now she's telling us the White House was broken. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=823.32s)]
*  Wait a second, who else wrote a book about this? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=826.44s)]
*  Yeah, Tapper. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=830.44s)]
*  Binder's now DEI Tapper. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=832.2s)]
*  I wonder who got paid more. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=834.44s)]
*  And there's nothing noble about this turncoat, remember? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=836.76s)]
*  Do you believe that the president is as sharp today as he was when he took this job? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=840.04s)]
*  Have you seen any slowdowns? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  What I can say is this is a president who is strong and resolute [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  in delivering for the American people. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=852.2s)]
*  That's what I see. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=853.72s)]
*  So he's as sharp as ever? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=854.68s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever, as I have known him to be in my engagement and my experience with him. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=855.96s)]
*  Binder invented the word cheap fake. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=862.68s)]
*  She told you this real video of Biden getting lost in an Italian field was fake. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=865.64s)]
*  Now she's saying, yeah, my White House was broken and I'm switching parties. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=870.28s)]
*  Hopefully she can write better than she talks because DEI Tapper sounds a lot like Mamala. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=875.0s)]
*  I think we need to stop thinking in boxes and think outside of our boxes and not be so partisan. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=880.76s)]
*  And the way that I see moving forward in this space that we're in right now [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=888.6800000000001s)]
*  is if you are willing to stand side by side with me, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=893.08s)]
*  regardless of your political, how you identify politically, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=897.96s)]
*  and as long as you respect the community that I belong to and vulnerable communities that I respect, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=901.8000000000001s)]
*  I will be there with you. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=908.84s)]
*  This book, Independent, it's about looking outside of boxes, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  not just always being in a partisan stance. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=914.6s)]
*  While Binder's goal-digging for book deals, Democrats are rolling their eyes. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  One Democrat says Binder's book is the most grifty thing I've seen in a long time, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=923.4s)]
*  and that's saying something in Washington. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=928.84s)]
*  One former Biden White House official says she was the public face telling us all that this White [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=931.24s)]
*  House was on track and that Biden was amazing, and now she doesn't even want to be a Democrat. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=938.28s)]
*  Here's what CNN said about DEI Tapper. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  What bothers me about this, and I was making some phone calls before this to a number of former [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=947.8s)]
*  Biden administration officials and people in the White House where they were saying, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=952.36s)]
*  this is just all an attempt to sell books, and that is what the general consensus is right now [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  in the Democratic Party. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=962.6s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=963.72s)]
*  When Tapper's book came out, CNN was like this book was brave, but Binder writes a carbon copy, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=965.88s)]
*  and it's like, uh-oh, money grab, money grab. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=971.8s)]
*  One Democrat insider tells Fox, the job market's really tough right now for Biden world, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=975.48s)]
*  and I cannot begrudge anyone who needs to make a quick buck. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=980.68s)]
*  Binder's been trying to get a TV deal, but let's be honest, that was never in the cards. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=984.84s)]
*  After she left the administration, she tried to get a job co-hosting The View. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=990.12s)]
*  But The View never called her back. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=996.04s)]
*  Some people have better luck. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  Just ask Lloyd Austin. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  He's making some moves from the Pentagon to K Street. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1002.76s)]
*  Lloyd's now a lobbyist. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1006.28s)]
*  Others are getting slapped with subpoenas. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1008.6s)]
*  Comer's having his own summer soiree, sending letters to top Biden aides who had a heavy hand [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1010.68s)]
*  in the cover-up. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1016.04s)]
*  The sly five just got a formal invite to be deposed. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1017.32s)]
*  And Joe's doctor? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1021.32s)]
*  He's not off the hook either. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1022.52s)]
*  The one who gave him more COVID tests than prostate exams? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1023.88s)]
*  O'Connor and Comer? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1027.24s)]
*  They're checking their calendars right now for a good date. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1028.52s)]
*  Voters just want respect. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1032.04s)]
*  And the truth. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1034.28s)]
*  Two things Democrats abandoned because the machine told them to. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1035.48s)]
*  But instead of earning it back, they're trying to buy it back. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1039.16s)]
*  They just dropped 20 mil on a study about men. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1043.0s)]
*  The project's called Speaking With American Men. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1046.2s)]
*  Sam. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1049.96s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1051.0s)]
*  Sam's led by a lady who works in the abortion industry and used to work for Media Matters [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1052.44s)]
*  and MoveOn.org. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1058.44s)]
*  She specializes, are you ready, in gender and extremism projects. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1060.5200000000002s)]
*  And here's what she found. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1065.24s)]
*  Democrats are seen as weak, whereas Republicans are seen as strong. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1067.16s)]
*  Young men also spoke of being invisible to the Democratic coalition. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1071.96s)]
*  20 million dollars for that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1076.76s)]
*  Hulk Hogan told you that for free. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1078.92s)]
*  And how are you supposed to get strong when your loudest leaders tampon? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1080.84s)]
*  Next, they asked, do Democrats know what a man is? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1085.48s)]
*  Quote, the focus groups found that young men feel they are in crisis, stressed, ashamed, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  and confused over what it means to be a man in 25. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1095.3999999999999s)]
*  They vented about conflicting cultural messages of masculinity that put them in a no-win situation [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1099.9599999999998s)]
*  around the meaning of a man. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1105.9599999999998s)]
*  So this was the men of the focus group, men who were confused about what it means to be a man [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  and men who were ashamed of being a man. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1114.76s)]
*  And they found a Hispanic guy in Vegas who, shocker, doesn't love Lady Gaga. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1118.28s)]
*  Quote, a Latino man from Las Vegas said that during the 24 campaign, Harris focused on, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1124.12s)]
*  oh, I got Beyonce on stage with me. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I got Lady Gaga on stage. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1131.8799999999999s)]
*  And it just kind of felt like, what does that have to do with me? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1133.8s)]
*  I'm trying to move up in life. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1137.0s)]
*  Trump's over here like, if we're able to get a surplus in our budget, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1139.32s)]
*  then we're going to have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1143.08s)]
*  Men aren't a million dollar science experiment. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1147.64s)]
*  They're studying us like we're space aliens. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1150.04s)]
*  And just because you grow a beard and make a podcast doesn't make Democrat men manlier. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1153.88s)]
*  It kind of makes you look like you're going undercover. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1158.52s)]
*  And speaking of undercover, was Binder undercover this whole time? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1161.88s)]
*  Former White House officials say Binder would joke about being an independent [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1166.28s)]
*  while she was in the administration. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1170.28s)]
*  That tracks because she left the White House on Jan 20th and wrote a 300 page book in four months. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1173.24s)]
*  Now, I've written two books. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1180.68s)]
*  It's impossible unless you've been writing it for a long time. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1182.68s)]
*  No wonder you're a man. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1186.52s)]
*  Unless you've been writing it for a long time. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1187.64s)]
*  No wonder she was so bad at briefing. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1190.44s)]
*  She was unprepared because she was busy writing this backstabbing book. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1192.2s)]
*  The two big DEI picks Biden made, Kamala and Binder, blew up in his face. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1198.5200000000002s)]
*  DEI hand grenades. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1204.92s)]
*  Kaboom. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1207.0s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1208.76s)]
*  And tonight we start with this Fox News alert. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1209.72s)]
*  Moments ago, President Trump issuing a full and part or partial travel ban [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1211.48s)]
*  from 19 countries, including Yemen, Iran and Somalia. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1216.3600000000001s)]
*  We have full details straight ahead. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1220.8400000000001s)]
*  But tonight, buckle up, we've got a busy show. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1222.44s)]
*  In moments, the Deputy Director of the FBI, our friend Dan Bongino, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1225.3200000000002s)]
*  he will join us with an exclusive look into the absolute unmitigated mess [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1229.16s)]
*  that Joe Biden left this country in when he left office. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1234.68s)]
*  We have known terrorists. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1238.68s)]
*  We have Iranian assassination squads. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1239.96s)]
*  We have rapists. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  We have murderers. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1243.24s)]
*  We have cartel members. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1244.2s)]
*  We have gang members, drug dealers, all in this country. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1245.48s)]
*  We all need answers. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1249.4s)]
*  Cash Patel, Dan Bongino, Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1251.08s)]
*  They apparently not only inherited a difficult job of far worse than any of us knew apparently. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1254.52s)]
*  We'll get the details tonight. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1261.0s)]
*  Progress thankfully is being made. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1262.68s)]
*  We'll have more on that straight ahead. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1264.68s)]
*  Plus, Senator Kennedy has a message for the far left law professor [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1266.04s)]
*  that went before his committee. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1270.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1271.88s)]
*  And you say they're evil members of the United States Supreme Court? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  Gag me with a spoon. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1277.8200000000002s)]
*  We got that full exchange coming up and huge news from Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1281.5800000000002s)]
*  She's leaving the Democratic Party in an apparent PR stunt to sell her book. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not working if you look on Amazon. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1291.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1293.1000000000001s)]
*  The number one question they ask me is, Karine, how do we get out of this? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1294.5400000000002s)]
*  How do we protect our democracy? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1298.5400000000002s)]
*  How do we protect vulnerable communities among us? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1300.54s)]
*  What do we do next? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1303.42s)]
*  Because we don't have answers here. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1305.42s)]
*  That's what they ask me. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1307.26s)]
*  And this is my answer. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1308.86s)]
*  Now, if her book is anything like her time as Biden's very own Baghdad, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1311.98s)]
*  Bob, well, it will be poorly written and probably full of lies. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1315.82s)]
*  But we begin with a much more important matter and important news tonight. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1319.58s)]
*  That is the weaponized, politicized Justice Department that President Trump inherited, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1323.42s)]
*  a country that is not safe and secure, a Defense Department that needs massive reform [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1328.46s)]
*  in the elimination of woke and the next generation of weaponry. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1333.74s)]
*  But under Biden, the DOJ, the FBI became an enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1336.94s)]
*  The red flags were everywhere. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1342.7s)]
*  And now it is up to Cash Patel, Dan Bongino, Pam Bondi to get to the bottom [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1344.78s)]
*  of what is a massively long list of corruption. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1349.66s)]
*  This includes the unprecedented witch hunts against Donald Trump, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1352.7s)]
*  the raid of his home. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1356.62s)]
*  They didn't raid Hillary's home. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1357.8999999999999s)]
*  They didn't raid Joe's home. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1359.1s)]
*  FISA abuse with the dirty Russian disinformation dossier, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1360.7s)]
*  the national security probe into angry parents at school board meetings, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1364.62s)]
*  the targeting of traditional Catholics who are labeled as domestic terrorists by Joe Biden's FBI. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1368.62s)]
*  And let's not forget about the obsessive and heavy handed January 6th prosecutors, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1375.02s)]
*  including some who just walked in and walked out of the Capitol building, apparently. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1380.54s)]
*  The same people, by the way, on the left, they ignored 574 riots. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1385.74s)]
*  They said it was the summer of love in the summer of 2020. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1390.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris, those rioters won't stop. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1394.3s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1396.4599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, we won't stop supporting them. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1397.58s)]
*  We had two dozen dead. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1399.9799999999998s)]
*  We had a thousand cops injured and billions in property damage. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1401.74s)]
*  No investigation, no outrage. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1405.74s)]
*  Equally disturbing, the lack of prosecutions, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1407.9799999999998s)]
*  light sentences for violent rioters on the left. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1410.54s)]
*  They have all this videotape they could have used to find them. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1414.46s)]
*  They're on video burning places down, throwing rocks at cops and bricks and bottles and Molotov cocktails, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1417.26s)]
*  including extremists that were dressed up like terrorists, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1423.74s)]
*  openly threatening Jewish people and wrecking college campuses. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1427.02s)]
*  And while the Biden administration proudly labeled so-called right-wing extremism [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1431.58s)]
*  as the existential and biggest threat to democracy in America, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1436.14s)]
*  left-wing extremists, they went unchecked, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1440.6999999999998s)]
*  including the illegal immigrant terrorists who were lighting Jewish people on fire [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1443.1s)]
*  as we watched this weekend in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1449.1799999999998s)]
*  As we have predicted on this show, the ultra-laxed enforcement of our immigration laws [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1451.9799999999998s)]
*  under Biden is a ticking time bomb. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1457.1799999999998s)]
*  I keep saying it's not if, it's when, but I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1459.5s)]
*  I'm not wrong. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1463.1s)]
*  The new leadership of the FBI, they are working over time to locate and arrest [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1464.06s)]
*  terrorists, rapists, murderers, cartel members, gang members. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1469.9s)]
*  In fact, so far, look at this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1474.38s)]
*  The FBI has spent over one million manpower hours investigating, apprehending criminal [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1476.38s)]
*  aliens since Donald Trump took office, especially those involved in the drug trade, human trafficking. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1483.02s)]
*  Now, here's what they inherited. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1488.46s)]
*  Let me go through it slowly. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1489.98s)]
*  We have in our country, in your country, known terrorists, we don't know where they are. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1491.5800000000002s)]
*  Cartel members, we don't know where they are. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1497.02s)]
*  And by the way, Iranian assassination squads, and we don't know how to find them yet either. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1500.0600000000002s)]
*  And gang members and murderers and rapists, other violent criminals and drug dealers, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1505.5s)]
*  cartel members, all in our country right now. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1511.26s)]
*  I know there are also other very important issues. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1514.46s)]
*  The president, Cash Patel, Pam Bondi, Pam Bongino, they promised to get to the bottom of all of it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1517.18s)]
*  The Epstein files, RFK, JFK, MLK files. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1523.18s)]
*  Every one of these things is important. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1527.66s)]
*  I personally want answers. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1529.5s)]
*  We have been promised they would be forthcoming, and I believe they will be. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1531.5s)]
*  But the first priority has got to be national security. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1535.66s)]
*  The crisis left behind by Joe Biden, the most preventable national security disaster in our history. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1539.58s)]
*  Tonight, we are seeing the results. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1545.98s)]
*  Murder is way down in almost every major city in the US. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1547.74s)]
*  The border is almost 100% secure. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1551.34s)]
*  As you can see, the new leadership of the FBI does not have an easy job. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1553.82s)]
*  Again, they inherited an absolute unmitigated disaster. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1558.22s)]
*  And to make matters worse, navigating the hyper-partisan anti-Trump bureau, that is no easy task. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1561.26s)]
*  Yes! Thank you. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1578.7s)]
*  See, kill me, that's the opposite of booing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1583.74s)]
*  Happy Wednesday, everyone. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1586.5400000000002s)]
*  So, big news. Korean Jean-Pierre says she's leaving the Democratic Party. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1588.5400000000002s)]
*  Bye. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1595.26s)]
*  I don't blame her. How could she trust the people dumb enough to hire her? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1597.26s)]
*  Greta Thunberg posted pictures of herself having fun as her sailboat nears Gaza. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1605.0200000000002s)]
*  Sailing experts and non-experts alike criticized the photo, saying she should be wearing a helmet. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1611.66s)]
*  Filmmaker Michael Moore is proposing a new pledge of allegiance. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1625.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1629.74s)]
*  Wants a new pledge of allegiance for those who oppose President Trump. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1631.3400000000001s)]
*  It includes a few new phrases and ends with liberty and justice for Arby's. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1636.22s)]
*  He looks like he ate Michael Moore. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1644.46s)]
*  The White House is celebrating as plummeting murder rates dip below pre-COVID numbers. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1647.74s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1654.38s)]
*  Well, I guess that means you-know-who is taking some time off. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1657.9s)]
*  Amazing story. Scientists injected 40,000-year-old Neanderthal DNA into mice, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1666.38s)]
*  resulting in very unexpected changes. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1674.54s)]
*  They died. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1678.22s)]
*  A record 37.5 million metric tons of seaweed was detected in the Atlantic. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1686.38s)]
*  I believe we have a picture. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1694.5400000000002s)]
*  We're not even trying anymore, are we? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1702.14s)]
*  If it ain't broke. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1703.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1705.26s)]
*  It ain't broke. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1705.5800000000002s)]
*  According to MSNBC, Democrats should try to win over men by reaching out to guys at the gym. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1706.46s)]
*  Well, I called dibs in the steam room, said one man. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1712.5400000000002s)]
*  A man who slept in his car was arrested for breaking into a woman's home and licking her toes while she was sleeping. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1715.5s)]
*  I know, gross. Sleeping in your car. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1725.5s)]
*  And finally, Sesame Street announced they're wishing everyone a happy Pride Month. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1732.54s)]
*  To celebrate, Cookie Monster is now only eating snickerdoodles and cookies. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1738.54s)]
*  To celebrate, Cookie Monster is now only eating snickerdoodles that taste like ass. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1742.54s)]
*  So young men have abandoned the Dems, and MSNBC thinks they have a solution. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1758.7s)]
*  Hit the gym. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1764.78s)]
*  Well, I tell them to head to gold, but I know how they feel about Jews. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1766.22s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1772.54s)]
*  The column reads, quote, the sweat of your brow is all that stands between you and success. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1775.42s)]
*  It's an understandable, even healthy impulse. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1781.18s)]
*  And Democrats would do well to start rebuilding their political muscle, quite literally, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1783.6599999999999s)]
*  by seeking to identify with the guy at the gym. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1788.22s)]
*  So fitness is acceptable now. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1792.22s)]
*  Few years ago, the left said exercise was racist. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1794.54s)]
*  Hell, if that's the case, my glutes make me the grand wizard of the KKK. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  True, I like to crossfit. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1804.94s)]
*  But only Democrats could politicize sit-ups. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1809.9s)]
*  And now they find gym attendance understandable, even healthy, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1813.74s)]
*  as if somehow that fact was in question. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1817.26s)]
*  Next, you're going to tell us that bathing keeps you from getting mean looks in the elevator. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1820.3000000000002s)]
*  And so now the Dems see the gym as worthy, but not as physical self-improvement, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1825.3400000000001s)]
*  but as a political tool to probe these weird, buffed creatures at the gym. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1829.5800000000002s)]
*  Of course, this illustrates the general misery of the Democrat Party. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1835.0200000000002s)]
*  They don't understand why anyone would go to the gym. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1838.7s)]
*  But if I don't go, I get depressed, a direct cause and effect. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1841.74s)]
*  I mean, what's a great career in the admiration of millions mean without my six-pack abs? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1845.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1851.26s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1855.5s)]
*  That picture was taken tomorrow. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1861.74s)]
*  Dems, though, immersed in their world of something for nothing, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1865.26s)]
*  can't believe people actually put in hard work for a result that comes later. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1869.1s)]
*  Nope, instead, if you want something, the government will provide. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1873.58s)]
*  And if someone else has something you want, just take it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1877.1s)]
*  But for the Dems, that's the problem with fitness. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1880.54s)]
*  It's hard to loot. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1883.5s)]
*  You can't steal it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1884.9399999999998s)]
*  Weights are heavy. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1886.3s)]
*  And muscle, you've got to make it yourself. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1887.74s)]
*  Sadly, there's no such thing as fitness reparations, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1890.3s)]
*  where a woke weakling can demand a muscle transplant from yours, truly. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1893.34s)]
*  No, you have to put the hard work in for a long-term goal, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1898.78s)]
*  not whine like a baby until people start calling you a hero. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1902.22s)]
*  This may be why Dems are so depressed. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1906.06s)]
*  Exercise improves your health and your appearance, which they avoid, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1908.3799999999999s)]
*  believing it's an activity that steals valuable time from [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1913.1s)]
*  shouting at Jews or keying Teslas. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1916.22s)]
*  Instead, you should burn calories curling Molotov cocktails and squatting in homes. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1920.1399999999999s)]
*  And the only deadlift they did was supporting Joe. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1925.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1933.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1933.6s)]
*  But we know that you feel great after a workout, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  just as you feel awful after pounding a sack of donuts. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1939.28s)]
*  Are the Dems even close to recognizing this? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1942.48s)]
*  Well, one think tank, Searchlight, is trying to, quote, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1945.36s)]
*  push the Democratic Party toward the most effective, broadly popular positions [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1948.7199999999998s)]
*  and create a space where Dems can think freely and put those ideas into the world. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1953.04s)]
*  Meaning they want to mirror Republicans without it being authentic. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1957.52s)]
*  It's like pretending it's your birthday to get free cake. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1961.44s)]
*  It's why Joey, Joey, Joey Bayard's staff thinks she's 247. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1964.64s)]
*  They want the results without doing the heavy lifting. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1972.96s)]
*  No wonder they hate the gym. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1975.76s)]
*  But amazingly, one consultant calls for a complete rejection of identity politics. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1977.6000000000001s)]
*  Wow, where have you heard that? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1983.28s)]
*  Why don't they just watch Gutfeld everyone else is? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1984.72s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1988.0800000000002s)]
*  We told you 10 years ago that identity politics will be as dead on arrival as those lizards [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  I tried to ship through the post office. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, I hope the Dems heed that advice, but it's going to be tough. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2003.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like asking the cast of The View to give up stretch pants. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2006.0s)]
*  Identity is ingrained in all their actions, and it's a miserable filter, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2010.0800000000002s)]
*  for it's based on resentment, making you as bitter as the coffee pot [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2014.3200000000002s)]
*  that I pee in over at Fox and Friends. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2018.3200000000002s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2021.52s)]
*  We use a different filter, one that's rooted in reality. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2025.2s)]
*  It's why we don't need a think tank to make sense of the world. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2029.2s)]
*  We already know not to let murderers into the country and men into women's bathrooms. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2032.4s)]
*  We keep it simple. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2037.2s)]
*  See, we understand life is difficult enough already [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2038.96s)]
*  without starting the day with a massive chip on your shoulder. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2042.4s)]
*  And that's a weight we refuse to carry. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2045.92s)]
*  We save that energy for the gym. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2048.56s)]
*  Let's welcome Henry Skitt. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2051.92s)]
*  They call him Dura Flame because his books end up in the fireplace. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2059.68s)]
*  Fox and Friends co-host and host of One Nation, Brian Kilby. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2064.96s)]
*  As a baby, his first words were Sean Hannity, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2070.88s)]
*  GOP Youth Advisory Council co-chair, C.J. Pearson. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2074.8s)]

*  How could the Dems could have connected with you? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2111.44s)]
*  See, with that, I complimented you. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2115.52s)]
*  Very good. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2116.64s)]
*  I'm trying new strategy. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2117.52s)]

*  Are you kidding me? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2123.6s)]
*  I've never had... [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2124.32s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2125.2000000000003s)]
*  This is so backwards. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2127.28s)]
*  Dems say, I want to get men, I want to get younger men, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2129.04s)]
*  I want to win them over, so I'm going to go find them. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2131.36s)]
*  I want to find the next Joe Rogan. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2133.84s)]

*  What happens is, no one found Joe Rogan. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2138.24s)]
*  Joe Rogan was Joe Rogan looked and made his own judgment. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2142.3999999999996s)]
*  Went to the gym in his case. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2145.2s)]
*  Most cases you want to have control of your life, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  so you go to the gym. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2148.8799999999997s)]
*  So Dems want to go mimic that, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2150.56s)]
*  but there's nothing authentic about it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2152.9599999999996s)]
*  You got to be real, you got to be yourself. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2154.64s)]

*  Sometimes. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2159.4399999999996s)]
*  Is he open to ideas? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2160.24s)]
*  Yes, sometimes. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2162.56s)]
*  But what he wants to do is be successful. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2163.6s)]
*  And what Dems want to do is get votes. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2166.3199999999997s)]
*  Just be yourself. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2168.72s)]

*  It just struck me. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2176.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, I believe, has never gone to a gym. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2177.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2180.4799999999996s)]
*  They said don't even bring up working out. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2181.9199999999996s)]
*  I asked him one time, he's thinking about working, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2183.3599999999997s)]
*  he goes, don't even bring that up. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2184.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2185.9199999999996s)]
*  He works out on the golf course. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2188.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2189.6s)]
*  Yeah, he works out on the golf course. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2190.16s)]
*  Yeah, walks to the cart and goes to the next hall. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2191.4399999999996s)]
*  Also, signing executive orders gave him a big bicep. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2193.7599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2196.08s)]
*  But hey, look, it's working for him. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2198.24s)]
*  He's doing great. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2200.0s)]
*  78 years old on your mouse. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2200.72s)]
*  All right, enough brown-nosing. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2202.24s)]
*  CJ, the fact that they needed consultants [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2204.08s)]
*  is underlying Bryant's point, that they [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  don't know what to think. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2209.44s)]
*  It's absolutely embarrassing. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2211.84s)]
*  They're spending $20 billion in an attempt [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2212.96s)]
*  to appeal to young men. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2215.04s)]
*  They might as well set it on fire, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2216.08s)]
*  because let's just address the elephant in the room. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2217.44s)]
*  The only young men that these Democrats are appealing to today [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2219.84s)]
*  are young men who think they're women like Dylan Mulvaney. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2223.76s)]
*  That's just the fact. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2226.48s)]
*  And it's not surprising when the face of their party [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2230.48s)]
*  is David Hogg, who I have had ex-girlfriends with bigger [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2232.88s)]
*  biceps then, right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2235.5200000000004s)]
*  So it's not surprising that when you look at this party [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2237.0400000000004s)]
*  that has spent the last several years demonizing men [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2240.32s)]
*  for striving to simply just be men, for being protectors, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2243.0400000000004s)]
*  for being providers, this is why young men are running away [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2246.5600000000004s)]
*  from them. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2250.32s)]
*  Personally, I'm shocked that they're shocked, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2251.1200000000003s)]
*  we want nothing to do with them. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2253.52s)]
*  Mm. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2254.96s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2255.44s)]
*  When you're looking for men, do you go to the gym? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2260.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2263.28s)]
*  When I'm not down at the pier. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2264.4s)]
*  Yeah, the pier. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2269.52s)]
*  What time are you usually around the pier? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2270.32s)]
*  Well, they usually kick me out around 5 AM. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2272.64s)]
*  You know, every week it's- [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2276.64s)]
*  You bring home a good haul, don't you? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2277.2s)]
*  I sure do. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2278.48s)]
*  That's why they call me the USO, and every week [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2279.84s)]
*  is Fleet Week in my house. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2281.92s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2283.68s)]
*  I know, Tyrus is so- he's so disappointed. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2286.56s)]
*  I was thinking like, what are they going to do? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2288.96s)]
*  Because they're sitting around going, you know, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2291.6s)]
*  maybe we should just run Andrew Tate. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2293.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2295.6s)]
*  You know, he's out of prison, like the guys like him, right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2296.16s)]
*  And they're like, what do guys like? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2299.92s)]
*  They like big boobs, so let's just send some ring girls [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2301.84s)]
*  to the gym with giant cards which say things like, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2305.92s)]
*  you know, let's all vote for the Green New Deal. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2311.12s)]
*  And those are the ideas that they're running up against. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2316.4s)]
*  And it's so clumsy and annoying. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine a liberal coming up to you [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2322.16s)]
*  at the gym like, you know, lifting five pounds, like, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2324.88s)]
*  whoo, really, really feeling the burn, huh? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2328.24s)]
*  Like Bernie Sanders, you know? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2331.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2332.96s)]
*  That's my kind of guy. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2333.52s)]
*  You don't mind if I work in with you, you know, equity and all that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2336.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2339.2s)]
*  What if I spot you? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2340.4s)]
*  You know, Tyrus, it is kind of funny that they can't rely [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2342.88s)]
*  on men in their own party. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2347.92s)]
*  They had to go outside. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2349.92s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2351.7599999999998s)]
*  They're henpecked. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2352.8s)]
*  Because their alpha is Swalwell. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2353.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2356.48s)]
*  You say that name wrong during Pride Week. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2359.92s)]
*  People get a little bit excited. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2366.0s)]
*  There's some Miss Reeds going on. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2367.92s)]
*  And this infuriates me, Greg. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2370.16s)]
*  I'm upset because the gym is the men's church. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2374.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2379.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't have preachers. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't discuss. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2382.08s)]
*  You don't talk to a man when he's lifting. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2383.44s)]
*  We wear headphones. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2385.44s)]
*  We're in our own world. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2386.3199999999997s)]
*  If you interrupt, if you pulled on my headphones, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2387.44s)]
*  I'd like to talk to you about the Democratic Party. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2390.16s)]
*  That'd be like that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2392.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2393.12s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2393.68s)]
*  You do not. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  We excommunicate chatty caddies in the gym. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2399.92s)]
*  That's true. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2403.2s)]
*  Gym is there to do work. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2403.68s)]
*  If 100 gorillas came in and my workout interrupted, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2405.3599999999997s)]
*  I'd take 99 of them and murder them. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2408.72s)]
*  I'd leave one left so you can go tell the others the story [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  so they won't come back to my gym. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2413.6s)]
*  You know, I just want to add, we don't condone [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2419.52s)]
*  the senseless murder of primates. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2421.92s)]
*  They had it coming. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2424.0s)]
*  They interrupted the workout. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2425.04s)]
*  It's a sacred place. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2426.72s)]
*  Peter, send your letters to that man over there. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2428.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  Up next, yet another reason The Washington Post sucks. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnciRdsF1s&t=2433.12s)]
