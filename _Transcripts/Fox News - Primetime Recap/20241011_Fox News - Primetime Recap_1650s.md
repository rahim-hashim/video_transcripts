# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 10, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs)
*  Last night, Hurricane Milton rocked Florida, and today, first responders are finally able [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=0.0s)]
*  to sift through the rubble. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=5.8s)]
*  The death toll is now up to 13 and expected to rise. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=7.34s)]
*  Homes are torn to shreds, trees uprooted, and more than 3 million people are without [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=11.28s)]
*  power. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=16.6s)]
*  The roof of Tropicana Field, where the Tampa Bay Rays play, was completely ripped open. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=17.64s)]
*  But Floridians aren't in the clear. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=23.52s)]
*  The waters are filled with gators, downed power lines, and bacteria. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=25.98s)]
*  If there's a silver lining to this disaster, it's that it probably could have been much [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=30.54s)]
*  worse. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=34.22s)]
*  Milton downgraded to a Category 3 as it reached the Gulf Coast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=35.22s)]
*  But even as a Cat 3, many citizens are without power, food, water, and shelter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=39.42s)]
*  Natural disasters are an excellent litmus test for a leader. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=45.42s)]
*  It tests a leader's decisiveness, organization, anticipation, compassion, and statesmanship. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=49.12s)]
*  Joe Biden's using Milton to play politics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=56.66s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken before President Trump at all? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=59.44s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=64.12s)]
*  Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life, man. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=68.8s)]
*  Help these people. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=72.88s)]
*  Will you hold him accountable? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=73.88s)]
*  You said you were going to hold those accountable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=74.88s)]
*  I'll put the hold on McConnell. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=78.36s)]
*  You better impress McConnell, because you know the truth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=80.08s)]
*  Biden spent almost as much time talking about Trump as he has the hurricane. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=83.8s)]
*  He wants to run for reelection so badly, but he can't, and it's driving him nuts. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=87.96s)]
*  But Kamala's worse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=93.0s)]
*  For three and a half years, she sat on the sidelines for every hurricane while Biden [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  ran the show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  She's never been interested in leading. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=99.64s)]
*  She was assigned to control the border, but she walked away. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  Just wasn't really her thing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris isn't interested in logistics, resource allocation, data analysis, communications, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=106.94s)]
*  or anything it takes to handle a crisis. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=114.06s)]
*  You can't save a drowning person with dreams and aspirations, so she'd rather just have [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=116.9s)]
*  other people take the lead. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=121.96s)]
*  But she's running for president, and it looks bad that she's sitting on the sidelines while [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=124.34s)]
*  Biden and Trump and DeSantis, you know, handle business. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=128.72s)]
*  Poor little Kamala's feelings are hurt. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=133.38s)]
*  She's left out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=136.74s)]
*  But the more she tries to help, the more she just gets in the way. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=138.4s)]
*  Back to back hurricanes, she's appointed herself. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=142.4s)]
*  Misinformations are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=147.9s)]
*  It is unconscionable, frankly, that anyone who would consider themselves a leader would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=148.9s)]
*  mislead desperate people to the point that those desperate people would not receive the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=155.06s)]
*  aid to which they are entitled. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  And that's why I call it dangerous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  We all know it's dangerous, and the gamesmanship has to stop. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  At some point, the politics have to end. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who's never gotten involved with hurricanes, ever, thinks she has DeSantis [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  on speed dial and picked a fight with them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  What a dumb idea. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=179.8s)]
*  They put out a story saying I didn't take, I didn't even know she was trying to reach [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=182.24s)]
*  me, but she has no role in this process. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=185.66s)]
*  And I've been dealing with these storms in Florida under both Trump and Biden. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=189.06s)]
*  And neither of them ever politicized it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=193.18s)]
*  She has never called in Florida. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=195.4s)]
*  She has never offered any support. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=198.16s)]
*  So what she's doing is she's trying to inject herself into this because of her political [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=200.36s)]
*  campaign. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  And for her to try to say that my focus should be on catering to her rather than worrying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  about my own people just so she doesn't understand what it means to respond to these natural [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  disasters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=217.22s)]
*  Kamala is not in the chain of command. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=218.22s)]
*  All she's doing is slowing things down. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  Right before the first hurricane, she was at a party. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=223.16s)]
*  Right before the second, she was drinking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=225.76s)]
*  Now she wants to wear a windbreaker and be a storm chaser. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=228.16s)]
*  Not happening. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=231.64s)]
*  During her Zoom hurricane briefing, Kamala looked bored and then was caught snapping [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=233.12s)]
*  at her staff for handing her talking points during a live broadcast. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=237.82s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=241.48s)]
*  So just really looking at some of the areas in Hillsboro River, Alifaya River, Peace River, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=242.54s)]
*  some of these type of traditional places that could flood. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=248.56s)]
*  We really got to watch those areas and those communities. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=252.28s)]
*  We're watching Kamala Harris shrink as a leader during hurricane season. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=256.72s)]
*  She's been overshadowed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=261.08s)]
*  Her participation is unnecessary, as most vice presidents are during hurricanes, to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=262.72s)]
*  be fair. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=267.64s)]
*  She's only politicized the storm and managed to make herself a nuisance. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=268.8s)]
*  She failed the leadership test. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=273.04s)]
*  But if you've been following Harris for the last four years, this isn't her first F. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=275.28s)]
*  News alert. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=282.28s)]
*  Barack Obama thinks Kamala Harris has officially plateaued. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=283.28s)]
*  And behind the scenes, he's saying worse. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=287.17999999999995s)]
*  Kamala's losing the black vote. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=289.88s)]
*  He was caught saying this just moments ago in Pittsburgh. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=292.28s)]
*  I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=312.28s)]
*  So if you don't mind, just for a second, I'm going to speak to y'all right here and say [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=321.76s)]
*  that when you have a choice that is this clear, when on the one hand you have somebody who [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=328.96s)]
*  grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=341.76s)]
*  and joy that comes from those experiences. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=355.76s)]
*  Now they're going to need white dudes and black dudes for Harris hats. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=363.76s)]
*  Now the Obamas and the Clintons are telling her no more talking. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=368.56s)]
*  The men are taking over. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=372.48s)]
*  They need to be sharp. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=375.24s)]
*  They need to be aggressive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=376.24s)]
*  They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=377.24s)]
*  I would put President Obama out to make that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=382.04s)]
*  He's only got a 92% approval with Democrats. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=384.48s)]
*  He only is the author, the father of 23 million people having insurance. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=387.62s)]
*  I would have President Clinton talking and going on these local TV stations talking about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=392.16s)]
*  how tariffs are going to destroy the economy of Wisconsin and Michigan. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=397.24s)]
*  The whole campaign needs to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=401.24s)]
*  This is a softer, gentler coup. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=407.04s)]
*  She's still the nominee, but Obama and Bubba are going to be taking charge. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=410.08s)]
*  They're letting Bill Clinton loose. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=414.08s)]
*  The comeback kid is hitting the campaign trail for Harris. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=416.04s)]
*  And the messiah, he is back. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=419.32s)]
*  Iraq's in Pittsburgh and the media's orgasmic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=421.6s)]
*  There probably isn't another human being on the planet right now capable of providing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=425.78s)]
*  more of an electric jolt to the Democrats' most winning coalition than President Barack Obama. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=431.34s)]
*  Barack Obama really has become the country's chief explainer in chief, the person who wants [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  to explain the moment we're in, the position we are, the stakes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=443.9s)]
*  He's obviously one of the best, if not the best, orators in politics that we've seen [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  in many years. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=453.82s)]
*  Barack is here to mansplain Harris to the country. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=455.58s)]
*  When the young lady says holistic, what she really means is here he was just moments ago. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=459.14s)]
*  This election's going to be tight because there are a lot of Americans who are still [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=467.58s)]
*  struggling out there. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=476.02s)]
*  So I get it why people are looking to shake things up. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=477.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I am the hope-you-change-you guy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=481.86s)]
*  So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=494.34s)]

*  He just said America's struggling and wants change from the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=506.34s)]
*  And Harris just said she doesn't represent change. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=515.1s)]
*  They don't have it this time, guys. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=519.02s)]
*  Obama once said Kamala Harris was the best-looking attorney general in the country. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=520.98s)]
*  He said she's Jamaican me crazy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=525.34s)]
*  Can he push his crush over the finish line? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  Feels like it's too late. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=530.86s)]
*  Everyone knows Kamala Harris is Joe Biden. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  past four years? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=542.5s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=545.22s)]
*  the decisions that have had impact. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=550.7s)]
*  After she said that, she went on Colbert and somehow made it worse. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=553.78s)]
*  Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be and what would stay the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=559.54s)]
*  same? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=565.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=566.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=567.5s)]
*  And so that would be one change in terms of... [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=570.1s)]
*  But also, I think it's important to say with, you know, 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=574.3s)]
*  And so when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=579.78s)]
*  looks like, were I to be elected president, it is about, frankly, I love the American [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  people and I believe in our country. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=594.58s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=597.1s)]
*  Kamala has had two months to come up with an answer to one question. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=599.34s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=604.42s)]
*  The best she could do was, I'm not Joe Biden and I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=606.14s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=610.18s)]
*  The core question of this election is, how is Kamala different than Joe? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=611.42s)]
*  They staged a coup because Joe is Joe and he couldn't win. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=616.38s)]
*  You can't say you're the same guy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=619.78s)]
*  She just said, I do all of the things that this terrible guy did, the same stuff, the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=622.06s)]
*  guy that was so terrible we couped him. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=626.7s)]
*  But I'm totally different from him. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=628.98s)]
*  But I can't put my finger on how. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=630.86s)]
*  Kamala just went on television and said she's running for president because she's not Trump [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=633.62s)]
*  or Biden. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=637.9s)]
*  I mean, we can go out on the street right here and pick anyone and they have the same [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=638.9s)]
*  qualifications. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=643.86s)]
*  CNN's not even convinced. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=644.86s)]
*  Vice President Harris has been asked repeatedly how she's different than President Biden. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=648.86s)]
*  And some people think she's been tripped up by answering that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=655.02s)]
*  How do you think she is different than President Biden? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=657.38s)]
*  Well first of all, whatever the differences is between them, it's not nearly as vast as [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=661.42s)]
*  the difference between her and Donald Trump. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=665.1s)]
*  She's obviously a woman. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=667.1s)]
*  She is a woman of color and she is of a new generation. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=668.18s)]
*  Kamala is not Joe Biden because she's younger, black and wears high heels. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=671.62s)]
*  That's the best Democrats can do. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=675.82s)]
*  He's a surrogate for the Harris campaign and the only difference he can point out are biological. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=678.02s)]
*  They can't answer the question because she's not different than Biden. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=683.86s)]
*  She's just a machine politician that supported party bosses to get promoted and she's been [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=687.62s)]
*  promoted all the way to the top. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=692.54s)]
*  And she's still loyal to the party boss because she doesn't know any better. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  It's the only thing she knows that works. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=699.86s)]
*  Blind loyalty. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=702.34s)]
*  She's never had to do anything on her own. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=704.66s)]
*  She's only had to say yes to get ahead. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=707.26s)]
*  She's no different than Joe. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=710.46s)]
*  They're just branding her differently. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=711.82s)]
*  The Democrats spent a billion dollars on turn the page, a new direction, millions of dollars [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=714.3000000000001s)]
*  on commercials, signs, t-shirts, and she just lit it on fire. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=720.1800000000001s)]
*  They say MAGA is a cult. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=726.46s)]
*  What do you call this? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=727.46s)]
*  She can't think of one thing she'd do differently than Joe Biden. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=729.24s)]
*  Not Afghanistan, spending the border. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=733.74s)]
*  I can think of a few things I would have done differently than Trump. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=736.82s)]
*  January 6th comes to mind. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=739.1800000000001s)]
*  I'd do that differently. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=740.66s)]
*  Kamala should try it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=743.06s)]
*  Pick something that didn't go well with Joe. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=744.38s)]
*  Look around. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=746.62s)]
*  There's plenty to choose from. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=747.62s)]
*  She's too afraid to pick because she's just a puppet. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=749.66s)]
*  The machine won't even tell her something to say about how she's different from Biden [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=752.54s)]
*  because it would make the machine look bad. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=756.3s)]
*  They'd have to admit that they screwed up because Biden's just a puppet too. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=759.26s)]
*  And Democrats can never admit they made a mistake because they've been lying about how [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=763.6999999999999s)]
*  great everything's been. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=766.98s)]
*  Kamala, who's been in power for four years, then said the American dream is gone. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=769.94s)]
*  The American dream right now is really elusive for far too many people in terms of even aspiring [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=776.34s)]
*  to own a home. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=782.2600000000001s)]
*  It's too expensive. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you're Obama, you have no choice but to step in. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=785.1800000000001s)]
*  You send her to do interviews, not in the lion's den. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=788.74s)]
*  You send her in to do The View, to do Colbert, and she says, I'm Joe Biden and I killed the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=791.74s)]
*  American dream. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=796.94s)]
*  The only thing different about Kamala was her accent. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=799.06s)]
*  Have you no empathy, man? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=804.18s)]
*  No, for the suffering of other people. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=806.66s)]
*  Have you no sense of purpose? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  Was that a leprechaun? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=816.02s)]
*  Was that Indian? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  Was that Jamaican? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  What was that? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm getting so... [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris has now reached the beer drinking stage. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=823.06s)]
*  Watch. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=826.54s)]
*  One of the old saws is they just want somebody they can have a beer with. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=828.02s)]
*  So would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=831.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  This was... [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=835.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, we asked ahead of time, because I can't just be giving a drink to the vice president [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=836.9399999999999s)]
*  of the United States, but I'd ask you... [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=841.98s)]
*  You asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=842.98s)]
*  You asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=843.98s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=844.98s)]
*  Okay, the last time I had beer was at a baseball game with Doug. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=847.98s)]
*  Okay, so cheers. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=853.98s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=854.98s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=855.98s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=857.4200000000001s)]
*  That tastes like the beautiful city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  The champagne of beers. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=867.4200000000001s)]
*  When female politicians start sipping beer on TV, that's when you know they know they're [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=868.9s)]
*  losing and they're especially losing men. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=874.34s)]
*  The bar is open. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=877.34s)]
*  So, that's kind of nice because it looks really dark in color, but it's very light in flavor. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=880.7s)]
*  It is. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=889.7s)]
*  It is. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=890.7s)]
*  That's young. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=891.7s)]
*  You get a lot of them. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=892.7s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=893.7s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=894.7s)]
*  That's good. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=895.7s)]
*  You can get in on that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=896.7s)]
*  You can get in on it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=899.7s)]
*  We've reached the pandering to the white working man phase. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=902.7s)]
*  Next, Kamala will be driving a pickup. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=906.7s)]
*  Shooting pheasants with walls. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  Probably throwing on an army helmet like Dukakis. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=910.98s)]
*  A politician sipped a beer on a late night show. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=913.86s)]
*  I've seen more edgier stuff on SpongeBob. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=916.1800000000001s)]
*  These aren't even interviews. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=919.94s)]
*  These are just opportunities to make Kamala look good, and it's not even working. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=921.26s)]
*  The media is just trying to manufacture a moment for Harris, but you can't fake a personality [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=927.0200000000001s)]
*  with beer and accents. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=932.0200000000001s)]
*  So they're turning to Obama. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=934.5400000000001s)]
*  And this. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=936.78s)]
*  Bill saw that and said, Hillary, get me some Doritos. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=946.78s)]
*  I'm going to Michigan. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=948.86s)]
*  Democrats are just throwing things at the wall, hoping it sticks now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=950.98s)]
*  While Trump's just doing his thing. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=954.0600000000001s)]
*  He went on a podcast with a bunch of comedians, and here's what he said about Biden. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=956.1s)]
*  He has one ability I don't have. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=961.82s)]
*  He sleeps. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=964.54s)]
*  He can sleep. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=965.7s)]
*  This guy goes on a beach and he lays down on one of those, you know, six-ounce, they [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=967.26s)]
*  weigh six ounces and he can't lift it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=973.5400000000001s)]
*  And somebody convinced him he looks good in a bathing suit. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=976.86s)]
*  And when you're 82, typically bathing suits aren't going to make you look great, but [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=979.46s)]
*  you're not going to be enhanced. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=984.22s)]
*  All right? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=985.22s)]
*  It's just one of those things. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=986.22s)]
*  I can't be sure about that, but typically you don't know. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=987.22s)]
*  Depends what he's packing. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=990.46s)]
*  He could have. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=991.46s)]
*  I don't know what the hell he's packing, but I don't want to know either. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=992.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=996.22s)]
*  What makes Trump interesting is that he's unpredictable. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=997.22s)]
*  Kamala, you can see what's coming a mile away. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1000.1s)]
*  I do a thing called a weave. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1004.74s)]
*  And there were those that are fair that say, this guy is so genius. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1006.82s)]
*  And then others would say, oh, he rambled. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1012.02s)]
*  I don't ramble. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1013.82s)]
*  If I start a story, what you do is you weave things and you do it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1014.82s)]
*  You have to have certain things. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1020.14s)]
*  You need an extraordinary memory because you have to come back to where you started. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1021.14s)]
*  A weave is only good if you come back. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1025.58s)]
*  You could go all the way over here and then get back. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1027.78s)]
*  I can go so far here or there. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1030.1s)]
*  And I can come back to exactly where I started. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1032.74s)]
*  Now, someday when you don't come back to where you started, then you're safe. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  Trump now ahead in Pennsylvania, Michigan. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1043.18s)]
*  He only needs to win one of those. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1046.42s)]
*  And then that's all she wrote. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1049.58s)]
*  He's a favorite in the betting markets and has the momentum. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1051.78s)]
*  It's close. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1055.58s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1056.58s)]
*  But you'd rather be Trump than Kamala right now. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1057.58s)]
*  His internal numbers must be really good because he's making a play for Virginia, Minnesota, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1059.94s)]
*  New Jersey. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1065.74s)]
*  And I don't even think this is possible. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1066.74s)]
*  I shouldn't even say it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1068.18s)]
*  But he said it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1070.22s)]
*  Even New York. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1071.7s)]
*  We just rented Madison Square Garden. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1073.58s)]
*  We're going to make a play. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1075.3s)]
*  We're going to make a play for New York. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1078.54s)]
*  It hasn't been done in a long time. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1080.3s)]
*  It hasn't been done in many decades. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1083.06s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1085.78s)]
*  So the porn industry has launched a $100,000 ad campaign in support of Kamala Harris. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1087.1s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1094.94s)]
*  They're both known for sucking. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1095.98s)]
*  But it does seem a bit ungrateful for porn stars to throw their support behind Harris. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1101.22s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing Trump gets after all the money he's given to them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1105.86s)]
*  The FBI thwarted an election day terror attack plot in the name of ISIS. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1117.4199999999998s)]
*  Evidently their destructive plan was to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1122.6599999999999s)]
*  Harris appeared on Stephen Colbert's show where the host asked if she'd drink a Miller [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1128.9799999999998s)]
*  High Life with him. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1133.54s)]
*  Normally when she sits down with a cold one, it's Joe Biden. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1135.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because he's dead. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1138.94s)]
*  Colbert asked her what she would do differently than Biden. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1148.02s)]
*  She said she's not Joe Biden or Donald Trump. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1151.22s)]
*  The sad part, she had to look at her driver's license first. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1154.82s)]
*  She also appeared on Howard Stern where he said he'd even vote for a wall over Trump. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1160.34s)]
*  Harris replied, I'm not a wall, but I am plaster. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1165.9399999999998s)]
*  New York Times opinion piece says we should abandon the idea of masculinity. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1174.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm way ahead of you, said one man. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1178.54s)]
*  Tampons! [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1185.54s)]
*  According to a poll, 80% of Americans believe World War III is just around the corner. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1188.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other 20% of Americans fear the possibility of this man around the corner. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1193.6200000000001s)]
*  And finally, a flight bound for Turkey had to make an emergency landing at JFK after [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1201.82s)]
*  the captain died on board. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1206.82s)]
*  Did someone say Turkey? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1210.26s)]
*  Asked one man. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1211.7s)]
*  All right, so the New York Times now claims that even this new so-called positive masculinity [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1218.22s)]
*  of progressive men sucks too. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1229.02s)]
*  The article is written by a feminist named Ruth Whipman. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1233.02s)]
*  Perfect name if you ask me. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1240.42s)]
*  I guess Sarah Ballcrusher was taken. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1242.22s)]
*  So we can forget toxic masculinity. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1248.22s)]
*  Now even positive masculinity is the problem. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1250.82s)]
*  Quote, after the cartoon supervillainy of Donald Trump and the smarmy misogyny of JD [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1254.22s)]
*  Vance, the positive masculinity of Waltz and his ilk is a joyful relief. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1259.62s)]
*  But, for the next generation of boys, we might do better to ditch the masculinity rhetoric [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1265.62s)]
*  altogether. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1271.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  She adds that the idea that boys must use masculinity as a constant reference point [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1274.6200000000001s)]
*  for their own value is harmful to them and others. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1279.8200000000002s)]
*  Whatever lady. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1283.22s)]
*  But look, what do you expect from the mindset that thinks women can sport a five o'clock [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1284.22s)]
*  shadow, but then mock women who want to be good wives and mothers? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1289.8200000000002s)]
*  They can no longer define a woman, so what the hell do they know about men? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  Sadly, the left's only real masculinity these days is coming from their admirals. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1298.82s)]
*  But look, having a liberal feminist write about masculinity is like having a vegan review [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1313.02s)]
*  the Outback Steakhouse. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1318.62s)]
*  She'll make everyone in the place miserable and you can't trust her with a knife. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1321.02s)]
*  But it is funny, after 300,000 years of functional biology featuring both male and female organisms, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1326.22s)]
*  in just the last few decades we have thoughtful experts deciding that all of that is wrong. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1333.6200000000001s)]
*  What an about face. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1339.22s)]
*  It's not unlike Howard Stern. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1341.22s)]
*  I mean, talk about a transition. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1344.22s)]
*  On Tuesday he conducted an interview with Kamala Harris that was so simpering and feminine [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1346.6200000000001s)]
*  I got my period while listening to it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1351.22s)]
*  You should hear what keeps him up at night. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1356.22s)]
*  This is what keeps me up at night. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1363.22s)]
*  I don't understand how my fellow Americans, I don't even understand how this election is close. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1365.22s)]
*  And yes, I'm voting for you, but I would also vote for that wall over there. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1371.22s)]
*  Well, he's half right. We do need a wall. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1377.22s)]
*  You know, to keep out gang members, fentanyl dealers, human traffickers and Anna Navarro. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1382.22s)]
*  What's funny though is that Stern actually thought that was a compliment. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1388.22s)]
*  Stern has become such a wussified sycophant he doesn't realize that telling Kamala that he'd vote for a wall [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1392.22s)]
*  is telling her that he knows she's as dumb as one. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1397.22s)]
*  I mean, not to mention Trump is the wall candidate, not Cackles McNeapads. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1401.22s)]
*  Stern got even more pathetic wondering how she doesn't nap. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1413.22s)]
*  When you said you don't nap, I get it because like what you've taken on is extraordinarily difficult. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1419.22s)]
*  And I mean, do you feel the pressure of the moment in the sense that like when I met you out in the hall, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1426.22s)]
*  I said, I'm really nervous because I want this to go well for you. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1431.22s)]
*  I want it to go well for the country. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1434.22s)]
*  Hold on. I need a minute. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1437.22s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1457.22s)]
*  Now, remember, Stern used to throw bologna slices at strippers' butts. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1459.22s)]
*  With accuracy, I might add. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1463.22s)]
*  Now he's worried the possible leader of the free world can't handle his verbal foot rub. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1466.22s)]
*  I wonder if he used to get this nervous for the strippers before he'd spank them on their bare asses with a dead fish. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1472.22s)]
*  Here's Stern on anyone daring to poke a little fun at Kamala. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1478.22s)]
*  Even when I watch them on Saturday Night Live with the where they have Maya Rudolph playing you, I hate it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1483.22s)]
*  I don't want you being made fun of. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1490.22s)]
*  I it is too much at stake. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1492.22s)]
*  I believe the entire future of this country right now. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1495.22s)]
*  I mean, as America landed the free home of the brave, I think it's literally on the line. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1498.22s)]
*  So a guy who's supposed to be funny for a living now claims her candidacy is too important to joke about. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1503.22s)]
*  This is a guy who once joked right after the Columbine massacre that the killers should have raped the students before killing them. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1509.22s)]
*  Not that I like that Stern, but this pendulum swing from saying the most tasteless thing in the universe to putting your balls in a tic tac container. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1516.22s)]
*  You got to wonder what's going on here. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1526.22s)]
*  It's striking that the king of the most misogynistic humor ever now turns into a breathless over a progressive, hopelessly shallow candidate. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1530.22s)]
*  But maybe that's the explanation. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1548.22s)]
*  This is Stern's self-imposed penance for subjugating women to demoralizing stunts, capitalizing on desperate females thirsting for attention, even if it's from an oily paddle striking their bare asses. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1551.22s)]
*  True, much of Stern's transformation is based mainly on a delusional hatred for Trump, but it's also coming from a bottomless hatred for himself and his past. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1564.22s)]
*  And he's projected his loathing onto Trump, which gains him accolades from his Hamptons neighbors and his new pal Jimmy Kimmel, who's also doing penance for his sins of the past. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1574.22s)]
*  But is Howard simply redefining masculinity? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1587.22s)]
*  And why isn't always the male lefties who are so desperate to get rid of masculinity entirely? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1590.22s)]
*  It's guilt and self-preservation. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1596.22s)]
*  Because scrape beneath the surface of any liberal male and what do you find? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1599.22s)]
*  A creep, terrified of his priggish past. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1603.22s)]
*  Piggish past, I mean, not priggish. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1607.22s)]
*  What is priggish? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1610.22s)]
*  And that fear turns them into obedient mouthpieces for a completely unqualified candidate. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1612.22s)]
*  They desperately forfeit logic and reason, and with that, all traces of masculinity. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1618.22s)]
*  And so Howard, you've been in therapy for what, 50 years? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1624.22s)]
*  And I just diagnosed your problem in one monologue. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1629.22s)]
*  No worries, the first visit is free. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDSdy3A8Qbs&t=1633.22s)]
