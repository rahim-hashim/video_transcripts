# Fox News Highlights - May 13th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto)
*  Deals, not war. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=0.0s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, we saw four different traits of Donald Trump on display today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=7.0s)]
*  The dealmaker, the peacemaker, the optimist, and the realist. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=12.64s)]
*  Let's start with the dealmaker. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  The deals announced by the White House totaled around $283 billion for the U.S. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=20.84s)]
*  The two biggest deals included Saudi Arabia's agreement to buy about $142 billion in military goodies from our defense industry, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  plus $20 billion for AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Good stuff. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  And the White House officials insist, look, they've only just begun. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  And organizers of the Saudi Investment Forum held today, attended by some of America's top CEOs, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=45.2s)]
*  also announced a total of 145 deals totaling more than $300 billion. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=50.88s)]
*  With this trip, we're adding over $1 trillion more in terms of investment and investment into our country and buying our products. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=57.88s)]
*  And, you know, nobody makes military equipment like us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=67.2s)]
*  We have the best military equipment, the best missiles, the best rockets, the best everything, best submarines. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=70.88s)]
*  The best salesman for America. Isn't that nice? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=77.2s)]
*  Especially compared to what we had during Biden's 2022 trip to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=80.28s)]
*  I know it's late, but thank you for being here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=86.16s)]
*  Had a good series of meetings, just finished more than two hours of meetings with Saudi leadership here in Jeddah, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=89.2s)]
*  meeting with the king for about a little over half an hour of working session with the crown prince and all the ministers from the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=95.6s)]
*  from the energy minister to the sports minister all the way down the line. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=103.36s)]
*  This trip is about once again, positioning America in this region for the future. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=106.64s)]
*  We are not going to leave a vacuum in the Middle East for Russia or China to fill. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=112.2s)]
*  And we're getting results. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=116.56s)]
*  Oh, really? Two whole hours he met with people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=118.52s)]
*  Well, Biden's results were evident from the minimalist backdrop he had. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=122.0s)]
*  Remember the greeting he received from the Saudi leadership, the fist bump? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=125.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Saudis treated Trump with the respect he deserved. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=129.4s)]
*  From the moment he walked down the stairs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=132.68s)]
*  I love the purple from Air Force One to the moment he departed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=135.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, he didn't come to lecture Saudi Arabia, but to treat them like a real economic power. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=141.0s)]
*  This is why the investment forum was such a masterstroke, because it benefits American workers by pushing more money into the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  And again, the gathering included the America's biggest corporate titans from Uber, Google, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  Open AI, Palantir and many others around the world like Jensen Wang from Nvidia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=161.28s)]
*  Where is Jensen, by the way? Where is he? He's standing here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=168.12s)]
*  Where is he? I just saw. Thank you very much, Jensen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=171.52s)]
*  I mean, Tim Cook isn't here, but you are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=174.72s)]
*  What a job you've done. He said he's got 99 percent of the chip market. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. That's a big that's that's not easy to beat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  But what a job you've done. Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=188.24s)]
*  We are proud to have you in our country. You know that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=189.92s)]
*  Thank you for the investment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  But it wasn't just Trump, the dealmaker. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=194.88s)]
*  It was Trump, the peacemaker. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=197.16s)]
*  Saudi Arabia may not have wanted to hear this, but Trump needed to say it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=199.64s)]
*  It's my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia will soon be joining the Abraham Accords. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=204.72s)]
*  I think it'll be a tremendous tribute to your country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=212.16s)]
*  And it will be something that's really going to be very important for the future of the Middle East. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=215.56s)]
*  I took a risk in doing them, and they've been an absolute bonanza for the countries that have joined. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=221.28s)]
*  And Trump even offered an off ramp to Iran with a warning. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=228.2s)]
*  If I can make a deal with Iran, I'll be very happy if we're going to make your region and the world a safer place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=233.68s)]
*  But if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=240.04s)]
*  then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure, drive Iranian oil exports to zero. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=245.44s)]
*  The choice is theirs to make. We really want them to be a successful country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=254.84s)]
*  We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=259.52s)]
*  But they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=263.68s)]
*  I love that. It's not going to last. Better act now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=269.12s)]
*  So in raging the forever war crowd, Trump has even said he'll meet with Syria's new leader. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, mind you, we haven't had normal diplomatic relations with Syria in over a decade. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  And since 1979, they've designated them a state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=283.68s)]
*  But President Trump announced an end to sanctions there in order to give peace a chance. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=289.12s)]
*  And that starts with a conversation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=294.68s)]
*  I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=297.4s)]
*  In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=304.52s)]
*  hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. That's what we want to see. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=312.0s)]
*  Now, as uncomfortable as this makes official Washington, people who can't think outside their bubbles, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=319.08s)]
*  I'm going to ask this tonight. What is the alternative for the United States? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=325.56s)]
*  Because we've had decades of war and interventionism and lectures and military tensions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=329.72s)]
*  None of it's worked. If anything, in many cases, we made matters worse, including for ourselves. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=335.8s)]
*  Trillions of dollars wasted, thousands of lives lost. Never get them back. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  And that brings us to Trump the realist. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=348.12s)]
*  Now, as much as we'd like to think that we have power and authority enough of it to order around the rest of the world, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=351.12s)]
*  it simply doesn't work. We end up offending potential allies that we may need down the road for our own security. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And because he's Trump, he couldn't resist reminding everyone of the failed strategies of his predecessors. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=366.08s)]
*  In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=372.88s)]
*  souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=380.04s)]
*  It is God's job to sit in judgment, my job to defend America and to promote the fundamental interest of stability, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=387.0s)]
*  prosperity and peace. That's what I really want to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, how can liberals be against this? They used to be anti-war and pro-peace. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=400.6s)]
*  But because Donald Trump is better at peace than they are, they're suddenly for war? What? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=407.8s)]
*  Again, we don't have to love everyone we work with. We're never going to. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=413.24s)]
*  But we do need to be realistic about meddling in other countries' affairs. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=417.32000000000005s)]
*  As I've shown repeatedly, I am willing to end past conflicts and forge new partnerships for a better and more stable world, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=422.12s)]
*  even if our differences may be very profound, which obviously they are in the case of Iran. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=429.72s)]
*  I have never believed in having permanent enemies. I am different than a lot of people think. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=436.12s)]
*  This is bold and it's refreshing. It's totally something we haven't seen before from an American president. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=443.56s)]
*  It makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but not I. Finally, undergirding all of this is Trump, the optimist. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=448.44s)]
*  Like, why condemn America to the unsuccessful policies and strategies of the past? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=457.08s)]
*  Why not chart a path that is uniquely focused on making America stronger, more prosperous, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=462.84s)]
*  and it would be nice, a little happier, get along a little bit better? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=469.96s)]
*  And that may require new partnerships for a better future. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  Before our eyes, a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts of tired [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=478.12s)]
*  divisions of the past and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=484.2s)]
*  where it exports technology, not terrorism, and where people of different nations, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=491.0s)]
*  religions and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=496.2s)]
*  We don't want that. Now, being an aggressive advocate for peace, it's always going to require [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=503.48s)]
*  optimism, but Trump's isn't blind because it's never, ever overridden by what's good for America [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  first. Most importantly for the people in this room, the days of economic misery under the last [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=517.48s)]
*  administration are rapidly giving way to the greatest economy in the history of the world. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  We are rocking. The United States is the hottest country with the exception of your country, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=528.76s)]
*  I have to say, right? I won't, I'm not going to take that on. No, Mohammed, I'm not going to take [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=533.32s)]
*  that on. Yeah, even with no sleep, you know, he doesn't sleep. A 12 hour flight, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=541.0s)]
*  Trump still flashed his sense of humor. So in the coming months, we're going to be checking to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=547.96s)]
*  confirm that deals promised are deals done. But for now, you're seeing the deal maker, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=553.0s)]
*  the peacemaker, the realist and the optimist at work. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=560.04s)]
*  Trump got an escort in Saudi Arabia. Not that kind, a military escort from the Saudi Air Force, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=564.44s)]
*  47 kicking off his first major international trip of the second term. Usually presidents go to Canada, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  Mexico or a NATO ally first. Trump picks Saudi Arabia because that's where the money is. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  The Saudis rolled out the lavender carpet over their lavenders, a symbol of generosity. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=585.32s)]
*  It represents the blossoming wildflowers in their deserts. Trump right on cue rocking a lavender [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  tie to match the Saudi crown prince breaking protocol and greeting Trump personally on the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=597.24s)]
*  tarmac. Usually they send an underling. Trump got a handshake. Remember, Biden gave the prince a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=602.52s)]
*  fist bump after calling him a pariah, then begged the kingdom to pump more oil. And the prince was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=608.6s)]
*  like, sorry, Joe, not happening. In Saudi Arabia, to quote the great Lil Kim, it's about money, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=614.44s)]
*  power and respect. That's Trump's language. A traditional welcome coffee ceremony followed, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=621.8800000000001s)]
*  but POTUS isn't a coffee drinker. So they gave him a cup and he held it like it was poison. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=627.8800000000001s)]
*  Trump over caffeinated. Can you imagine? They should have just given him a diet Coke. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=633.24s)]
*  The Saudis claim Trump later took a sip, but we think he faked it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=638.5200000000001s)]
*  The coffee ritual symbolizes hospitality, friendship, honor and respect. Back in the beast, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=643.16s)]
*  dozens of Arabian horsemen holding American and Saudi flags escorted them through the streets. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=649.72s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, horses represent beauty, nobility and pride. Whereas in America, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  they're just another thing we bet on. Then the honor guard welcomed the president, each holding [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=660.92s)]
*  golden swords. The Arab sword stand for justice, strength and sovereignty in Saudi culture. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=666.52s)]
*  But the most meaningful symbol of all, a mobile McDonald's truck, the way to a man's heart is [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=672.68s)]
*  through his stomach. But Trump didn't grab a Big Mac. He had other lunch plans. The Saudis hosted [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=678.52s)]
*  the whole cabinet, plus American business titans at the royal court. On the menu, miso beef with [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=684.28s)]
*  fermented vegetables and bacon crumbles to start. Main course, grilled black Angus and silky potatoes [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=691.0s)]
*  and an extra virgin olive oil parfait with strawberry salad for dessert. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=698.36s)]
*  But they barely had time to eat. They were too busy cutting deals. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=703.0s)]
*  Executives from Coca-Cola, Citigroup, IBM, Delta, United, BlackRock, Google and Amazon, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=721.08s)]
*  all in the desert with Trump. Also, Musk was there. Big Ball stayed in D.C. to watch the fraud. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=726.84s)]
*  But 47 is the main attraction. He managed to shake every hand in the kingdom. If you were a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=733.48s)]
*  Saudi citizen, you probably shook his hand. After a record rope line, the prince drove the president [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=738.92s)]
*  around in a golf cart before dinner, then played Trump's favorite song. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=745.16s)]
*  I don't think the village people would have survived too long in Saudi Arabia, but [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=759.56s)]
*  that's neither here nor there. Golf, McDonald's, Jets, swords in the YMCA. The Saudis are laying [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=763.0s)]
*  it on thick. But Trump came on a mission. Spread money and peace. The new generation of leaders [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=769.32s)]
*  is transcending the ancient conflicts of tired divisions of the past and forging a future where [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=776.6s)]
*  the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology, not terrorism. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=782.84s)]
*  We know the Saudis aren't the nicest guys, but the Middle East isn't what you'd call a nice [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=790.2s)]
*  neighborhood. When you go to a bad neighborhood, it's nice to have a friend. Biden called the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=794.52s)]
*  prince a killer. What'd that get us besides $5 gas? Not a lot. Trump took a different tack. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=799.48s)]
*  If I didn't like him, I'd get out of here so fast. You know that, don't you? He knows me well. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=807.0799999999999s)]
*  I do. I like him a lot. I like him too much. That's why we give so much, you know? Too much. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=813.96s)]
*  I like you too much. Great guy. After that, Trump was basically like, how do you sleep at night? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=820.76s)]
*  Well, how would you sleep at night? How do you sleep? Just thinking. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=832.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=837.96s)]
*  What a job. He tosses and turns like some of us. Tosses and turns all night. How do I make it even [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=844.2s)]
*  better all night? It's the ones that don't toss and turn. They're the ones that will never take [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=851.48s)]
*  you to the promised land, aren't they? But you have done some job. The point of the trip is to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=856.2800000000001s)]
*  tell the region, let's make money, not war. Nobody wants their legacy written in blood. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  Put down the sword and take out the checkbook. Just days ago, my administration successfully [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=867.08s)]
*  brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=873.0s)]
*  And I used trade to a large extent to do it. I said, fellas, come on, let's make a deal. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=879.88s)]
*  Let's do some trading. Let's not trade nuclear missiles. Let's trade the things that you [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=885.32s)]
*  make so beautifully. But if there's no respect, there's no mercy. I will never hesitate to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=892.52s)]
*  wield American power if it's necessary to defend the United States or to help defend our allies. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  And there will be no mercy for any foe who tries to do us or them harm. That was a message to the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=913.96s)]
*  Iranians and all their proxies in the region. And for that matter, anyone around the world who gets [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=921.24s)]
*  frisky. It's just day one of the Middle East tour and Trump's bringing home the bacon, the biggest [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  arms deal in history. Plus the prince signed over 600 billion in investments, but Trump wants a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  trillion. The investment in America was up an astounding 22 percent. More than 10 trillion [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=937.88s)]
*  dollars of new investments have been announced or are coming just since the election on November 5th. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=946.68s)]
*  Looks like the experts were wrong again. They said Trump couldn't bring back manufacturing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=953.4799999999999s)]
*  Now countries are paying us to make their chips. They said tariffs would trigger inflation. Well, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=958.68s)]
*  it just hit the lowest rate in four years. JP Morgan says there isn't going to be a recession [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=963.9599999999999s)]
*  and the stock market is up on the year. Oh, and eggs are cheaper. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=969.7199999999999s)]
*  Oil is down. Eggs are down. Food is down. We're seeing that reflected. So all that hysteria over [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=973.56s)]
*  tariffs is not showing up in these numbers. Why do they keep calling the experts the experts if [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=979.56s)]
*  they're wrong every time? Trump's telling Muslims to stop killing each other and instead make a [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=984.12s)]
*  killing here in America. And it's working. Do you think the Democrats will give him any credit? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=988.68s)]
*  Nah. California governor Gavin Newsom is now calling his city's homeless encampments unacceptable. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=995.72s)]
*  Which is odd since he's the guy who, you know, made them acceptable. Turning sidewalks into red [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  carpet events for drug addicts, thieves and unemployed CNN anchors. On Monday he urged [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  cities to ban the camps from sidewalks, parks and other public areas. So after years of denying the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1013.64s)]
*  problem, he's now pretending to fix it. Which is like putting on a condom as you're leaving a whorehouse. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  As you're leaving a whorehouse. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1024.52s)]
*  Who hasn't? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1029.08s)]
*  But as always, when a far left Dem runs for national office, he acts like a Republican. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1035.32s)]
*  This is where the left is really pro-trans. Suddenly they grow balls. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1041.4s)]
*  So Newsom is fed up with tent cities, the crime, the urban decay. No, he's not mad about that stuff. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1048.52s)]
*  He's mad you noticed. It's like a criminal telling a jury he's sorry he robbed 25 banks [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1054.04s)]
*  when he's just sorry he got caught on the 26th. Because this isn't some spontaneous crisis. It's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1059.56s)]
*  a man-made disaster like Chernobyl or Fox and Friends. And they like the show, okay? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1064.92s)]
*  And the man who made it acts like he had nothing to do with it. It's pure government grift, shoving [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1076.76s)]
*  you down a flight of stairs and then making you pay for the handrail. We've been lied to for years [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1081.96s)]
*  that homelessness is all about affordable housing. Fentanyl isn't the problem. It's that loan officer [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1086.68s)]
*  at the bank. Yet as we walk to work, we never saw families or kids, just men. So strung out on Fentanyl, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1091.72s)]
*  they look like they were playing Twister without a mat. Affordable housing won't change that. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1098.44s)]
*  Give them a house, they'll burn it down when they pass out holding a crack pipe. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1103.4s)]
*  Where do they think they are? The White House? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  See to the Dems, to the Dems, the homeless were always victims. And they are. Of Democrats. The [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1111.8s)]
*  people in these encampments are mentally ill, addicted, sometimes violent, often incapable of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1118.84s)]
*  basic hygiene, let alone stable living. Imagine a commune, but everyone works at MSNBC. You know, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1123.32s)]
*  it didn't used to be that way. When we were growing up, we called the homeless hobos. They were rare [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1131.32s)]
*  colorful characters carrying their prized possessions in a bindle, drinking Mad Dog 2020, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1136.84s)]
*  and wearing Michael Dukakis for President t-shirts. But then it changed. Hobos became the homeless, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1141.9599999999998s)]
*  a protected class given victim status, which became an incentive for people to migrate towards [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1149.32s)]
*  busy areas to mingle with the normies immune from the law, which made it worse. Contempt for these [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1154.36s)]
*  folks only grew with more contact. Have you ever taken your mom shopping at Embarquadero Center [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1159.9599999999998s)]
*  on her birthday and watched a man defecate in front of her? I did. And that man was Brian Kilmeade. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1165.64s)]
*  He cleaned himself up. But common sense says that you put these people in treatment [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1176.6000000000001s)]
*  and then returned the streets of San Fran to the folks who made them famous, cross-dressing hookers. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1182.76s)]
*  It's like the wildfires. Gavin blames climate change when it was his corrupt bureaucracy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1189.64s)]
*  Since the Palisades fire, which destroyed 6,000 buildings, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1194.6s)]
*  only four permits have been issued for rebuilding. Did climate change cause that? Hell no. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1198.04s)]
*  So like the fires, Newsom let homelessness run wild. They allowed tens of billions of dollars [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1203.8799999999999s)]
*  to be swallowed up by a maze of consultants, nonprofits, and bureaucrats who created poop [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1208.52s)]
*  mats. It's sad. Californians used to sell maps of celebrity homes, not landmines. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1213.7199999999998s)]
*  Now instead of sightseeing, tourists play hopscotch so their shoes don't get hepatitis. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1221.72s)]
*  And when residents complain, they're called cruel. And now we're supposed to believe Gavin? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1227.16s)]
*  Hell no. All the problems of the last decade were based on his and his party's lies. A man can grow [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1232.52s)]
*  his hair out and play girl sports. A gang banger can claim he's oppressed. That homeless junkie, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1238.44s)]
*  he's just an out-of-work artist. See, Newsom wasn't just ignoring the problem. He enabled it [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1243.48s)]
*  because Dems were in a woke crouch, terrified of their loony base. But now that he's seen the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1248.44s)]
*  White House, he's got a brand new act, a common sense centrist, just a soccer dad and khakis fed [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1252.76s)]
*  up with crime and chaos. It's all bulls**t. A costume, a political drag show, and the kids [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1258.76s)]
*  this drag queen is reading to are the gullible voters. He's the classic wolf in sheep's hair gel. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1263.96s)]
*  Just watch him answer the tough questions. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1269.88s)]
*  Any other questions here? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1273.48s)]
*  Yes, Governor. California has a terrible homeless problem. Why do you think that is? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1274.52s)]
*  You know, I appreciate that question. And I think it's a matter of perspective. Let's kind of flip [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1281.5600000000002s)]
*  the script on that, okay? Let's kind of put a new lens on that. I mean, you see a homeless man. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1287.3200000000002s)]
*  I see an outdoorsman. We got a lot of natural habitat in this state. And I'm not sure if [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1292.92s)]
*  outdoorsman. We got a lot of natural habitat in this state. And I'm just so proud that so [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1298.76s)]
*  many people in California can take advantage of that. All right. Next question. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, Governor. People are calling you Greasy Gavin. Why do you think that is? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1308.68s)]
*  I appreciate that question. I want to tell you, I've been taking fewer showers lately, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1314.92s)]
*  and I think people have been noticing that. All right. Fewer showers, shorter showers. We want to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1319.32s)]
*  save water here in California. We want to keep those reservoirs filled up because I don't know [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1323.8s)]
*  if you've noticed, but every once in a while, for no reason at all, California does tend to burst [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  into flames. That's it. Okay. I think we answered everything. Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  Fox makes him work so many hours as a personal favor to his wife. Fox and Friends co-host and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1348.04s)]
*  host of One Navistone, Brian Kilmeade. By being here tonight, he clearly had nothing going on. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1352.92s)]
*  Comedian Gerard Small. This former cheerleader will give you an H for headache. Co-host of [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1361.4s)]

*  author, comedian, and former NWB World Champion, Tyrus. Kilmeade, based on your low book sales, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1378.68s)]
*  you should be homeless. What do you think of the current state of California homelessness? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1388.2s)]
*  First, I'd like to address the crowd. You laughed at his monologue and you turned on me before I had [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1393.8s)]
*  a chance to say a word. I'll never forgive you. Number two, my book sales might be the best in the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1399.4s)]
*  company, but I know you're so jealous to bring that up. Stop it! Gavin Newsom wants to be president. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1403.96s)]
*  Yeah. But the problem is his track record, his performance as mayor, as lieutenant governor, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1413.0s)]
*  and governor, and your analogies are great. I think mine are better. And just hold on. And here's why. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1419.16s)]
*  He shows up at the fires and says, who the hell caused this? I'm going to crack down on the people [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1425.48s)]
*  responsible. He sees the homeless encampments blocking the sidewalks and said, you guys clean [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1430.6s)]
*  that up. He started it. He spent three billion dollars to fix it. And his opening words in 2020, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  when it got the job, is it's a disgrace. The richest state in the country and the richest nation [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1440.28s)]
*  of the world has a homeless problem. I will fix it. He spends a billion dollars. When it's not fixed, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1445.56s)]
*  he blames the mayors. And he also forced the movie industry and Silicon Valley out of the best state [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1450.1999999999998s)]
*  in the country by high taxes. I've never seen someone such a bad performance, but yet I think [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1455.96s)]
*  he's the front runner to get the nomination for the Democratic Party. Yeah, it's true. It's true. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1460.76s)]
*  They got nobody else. Sherrod, welcome back to my world. I love you. I missed you. I missed you too. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1465.32s)]
*  He dates back to red-eye. I watched him at three in the morning. Nobody cares about you, Brian. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1471.64s)]
*  I could. Stop stealing time from Sherrod. You got rid of Doocy. Now you want to get rid of Sherrod. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1475.48s)]
*  Are you saying this is a black-white thing? Yes. What the hell are you bringing race into it? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm kidding. Sherrod, you live in New York. Yes. Do you, when you, people tell you what homeless is, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1490.3600000000001s)]
*  you know what it is. Well, in New York it's cooler because they perform on the subways. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1497.4s)]
*  Yes. But I like how Gavin is pretending like he's not part of the four families that run California. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1501.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the Newsom's, the Browns, the Gettys, and the Pelosi's. Yeah. It's like this [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1507.4s)]
*  problem started way back and his family's a part of it. It's longer than his tenure as governor. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1512.84s)]
*  Yeah. So what else is new? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  There's no one shows, Greg. I missed you though. I missed you. Yeah, that's good. I love the jacket. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1522.04s)]
*  Thank you. It's yours after the show. Thank you. Emily. Now you get it altered. Yes. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1525.72s)]
*  Don't laugh, Emily. You won't be on the show anymore. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1536.4399999999998s)]
*  They have one like that's a baby gap. I'll get you that one. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1538.36s)]
*  Do they even have baby gap anymore? Oh, thank you. I just want to save a trip. Like he didn't know. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1546.04s)]
*  You know what, Emily, what drives me always crazy living in the city is when a tourist in my [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1554.4399999999998s)]
*  neighborhood would give money to a homeless guy and then they go back to Nebraska or Arizona and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1558.36s)]
*  feel good about themselves. But that just made sure that that homeless guy is going to stay on [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1564.4399999999998s)]
*  my street. They don't understand that you're feeding the problem. And ironically that you said [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1568.12s)]
*  that because when I was subjected to Newsom as mayor, when I lived in San Francisco, remember he [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1573.24s)]
*  had the care not cash program. Yes. And his whole point was, no, that's actually not spending money. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1579.1599999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. It was actually in concept, a brilliant plan because he didn't think of it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1583.6399999999999s)]
*  It was his campaign manager's idea. And that was before Gavin Newsom then slept with his wife. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1587.7199999999998s)]
*  That's why he, so he, like people who have memories, who remember his decades tenure of [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1593.8s)]
*  being born with a silver spoon, pretending he's not sharing all the donor monies of the five [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1599.32s)]
*  families and then leaving an imprint of colossal feces in California. Those of us who grew up with [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1603.8799999999999s)]
*  him, colossal feces. Yes. We've been subjected to it this whole time. I heard them open for blue oyster [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1610.04s)]
*  cold. But he has spent, historically there is no one that has spent more money on the homeless. And [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1615.08s)]
*  yet with such a meteoric rise on the homeless, but he's the thing. Here's the thing. He, this entire [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1621.56s)]
*  time has been obviously playing, he's been reading the room. So when his world was just California, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1626.84s)]
*  it was just San Francisco. Yes. It was as radical as it gets, just California, radical as it gets. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  But now that he's eyeing the whole full geography of the United States, then he's like, okay, I gotta [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1636.12s)]
*  be mainstream. But it's the mainstream media that is paving the way for that. That's, oh yes, we'll [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1641.32s)]
*  forgive you. Yep. So now Newsom is the centrist. Like they will forget the past even though we [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1646.04s)]
*  won't. Yes. Tyrus, don't you miss the hobos? Don't you miss hobos? No. With the tinnabines? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1650.84s)]
*  My mom was pretty clear what stranger danger meant, Greg. So you didn't go hang out and the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1659.32s)]
*  guy in the van for lollipops, she ran the other way. That's how I supplemented my allowance. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1664.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, speaking of full of ****, isn't it, I'm sorry, I'm confused. He's still governor, right? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1672.9199999999998s)]
*  So he could do something about it. That's the most irritating thing is that why did anyone say with [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1680.84s)]
*  a follow-up where he's like, the homeless situation is ridiculous. A follow-up question, aren't you the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1687.08s)]
*  **** governor? Yeah. That's the difference between the radical left and President Trump. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1691.8s)]
*  He'll talk about something as it's being taken care of. He's going to go up and say, listen, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1700.1999999999998s)]
*  we're going to, I'm going to sign an executive order to stop homelessness and here's how we're [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1704.6s)]
*  going to do it. Bam, bam, bam, done. The border, done. Five days later, 99% no one's crossed. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1707.4s)]
*  They're standing at the border like, you go, no ****, you go. No one wants to go. Newsom goes on [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  there and says, oh, there's a problem. This is what we saw this in New York when he put, what's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1719.72s)]
*  his name, Belasio, the guy you really hate? Yeah, Bill De Blasio. He put his wife in charge of the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1723.96s)]
*  homeless and there's what, $50 million still missing? Yeah. So this is another one of the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1729.0s)]
*  left's money schemes where the guy who's in charge is saying, we need help. We need to figure out [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1732.68s)]
*  a way to do this. So they're going to make a committee. They already have bubonic plague in [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1737.64s)]
*  California. I remember Dr. Drew was going, there's bubonic plague back in California. I grew up in [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1741.72s)]
*  California. I will not bring my kids back to my neighborhood because I don't feel like walking [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1746.6000000000001s)]
*  through, as you will affectionately call hobos, drug addicts and pedophiles and criminals who [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1750.3600000000001s)]
*  hide there because it's a great place to hide and commit crimes. So he could do something. He [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1755.72s)]
*  doesn't want to do something. He's just saying to see if the American people are stupid enough [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1759.56s)]
*  to fall for his. Yeah. You know, we used to call, uh, gotta move on. We had hobos. You know, we [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1763.32s)]
*  used to call the female hobos. Hoblos. Up next, the black pope. I came up with that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1770.6s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFb6xiKuto&t=1789.56s)]
