# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 7, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y)
*  But first, Trump in charge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2.16s)]
*  He commanded the room for over an hour on complex matters of foreign and domestic policy, on trade, on regulatory matters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=6.04s)]
*  And he's already announcing huge new foreign investment in the United States. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=14.48s)]
*  And that's going to create jobs and, of course, boost our GDP. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  But the media's take on Trump today was, well, more proof that they've learned nothing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=23.96s)]
*  One of the biggest things that stood out to me from that press conference, from moments when Trump got out there before he even started taking questions, is the level of anger. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=30.56s)]
*  He's really agitated. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=38.44s)]
*  He had a long list of grievances. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=39.8s)]
*  This should be someone who is upbeat and happy to come in, but he is still full of grievances. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's what they took from today. That's it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=46.44s)]
*  These people are as clueless as they were when they thought that Taylor Swift and good vibes and a billion dollars could drag Kamala across the finish line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=50.32s)]
*  If Trump was anything today, he was Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=58.96s)]
*  Confident, determined, candid, and, yeah, unafraid to call it as he sees it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=62.88s)]
*  If you were looking for optimism, he offered plenty of that today, too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=68.8s)]
*  We are at the beginning of a great, beautiful golden age of business. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=72.88s)]
*  And I think we're also at a golden age of common sense. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=78.72s)]
*  Great respect is being shown to our country again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=81.8s)]
*  And we have a great country, but we have to run it properly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=84.84s)]
*  It's going to be run properly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=88.72s)]
*  And again, unlike Biden, unlike Harris, Trump took questions from reporters. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=89.56s)]
*  He didn't hesitate to take questions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=94.48s)]
*  Most of the reporters, by the way, who never gave him a chance four years ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=96.76s)]
*  On the May trail, you vowed to bring down the prices at grocery stores very fast. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we won't do it fast. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=106.16s)]
*  But then you recently told Time magazine that bringing down prices would be very hard. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=107.16s)]
*  So what can the American people expect when you get into offices? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=111.12s)]
*  It's always hard to bring down prices when somebody else has screwed something up like they did. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=113.88s)]
*  But we'll bring them down. We'll get them down. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  Energy is going to bring down prices. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=119.56s)]
*  I think you're going to see some pretty drastic price reductions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=121.28s)]
*  So finally, we have a president who is focused on putting the American people first, not the global climate control freaks who've dominated us under Biden. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=124.52s)]
*  But on every issue today, issue after issue, he was clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=134.76s)]
*  Other countries aren't going to dictate our policies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=140.0s)]
*  And just because a policy has been in place for decades doesn't mean he won't be open to changing that policy, even when our allies are concerned. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=142.08s)]
*  Because when Trump is president, no one, not even our friends, are going to take advantage of us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=150.64s)]
*  We are not treated well, as you know, by Canada. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=156.76s)]
*  Canada is subsidized to the tune of about 200 billion dollars a year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=160.28s)]
*  They have a very small military. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=166.24s)]
*  They rely on our military. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=168.08s)]
*  It's all fine. But, you know, they got to pay for that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=170.4s)]
*  It's very unfair. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=173.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's refreshing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=175.32s)]
*  It's refreshing to hear a president standing up for America's interests again, taking a pragmatic approach to protecting the American economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=176.72s)]
*  But again, of course, the backbenchers who literally missed Trump's rise in 2016 and then again in 2024, always underestimating him, could only resort to the role playbook. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=186.44s)]
*  That was a trailer. That was an hour long trailer for the next four years in that he tells a lot of lies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=198.52s)]
*  He tells a lot of lies. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=203.96s)]
*  Now, this from a media that doggedly refused to report on what was obvious for four years, thinking of lies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, that, you know, look, we all saw Biden was not in charge, all the big defenders of democracy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=213.36s)]
*  We didn't have a president for the last four years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=218.88s)]
*  And we certainly didn't have someone living at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, who isn't was mentally fit for the job. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  So when they accused Trump of lying, I say consider the source. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=231.08s)]
*  The fact is, Trump was speaking inconvenient truths today, truths about issues that the talking heads don't bother to even think about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=235.28s)]
*  As usual, he's five steps ahead of them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  The Panama Canal is vital to our country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=248.28s)]
*  It's being operated by China, China. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=251.84s)]
*  And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=255.44s)]
*  We didn't give it to China. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=257.6s)]
*  And they've abused it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=259.48s)]
*  They've abused that gift. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=260.56s)]
*  It should have never been made. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=261.72s)]
*  Well, Trump was again, refreshingly un-Washington when he didn't even shy away from the subject, despite Jimmy Carter's lying in state today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=263.76s)]
*  Remember, he was the president who presided over the handover. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=273.6s)]
*  I liked him as a man. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  I disagreed with his policy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  So, hey, he thought giving away the Panama Canal was a good thing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=280.12s)]
*  I think it cost him the election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  This was a question that was asked of me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=284.88s)]
*  I didn't bring it up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  I didn't want to bring up the Panama Canal because of Jimmy Carter's death. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  But people don't bring it up. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, it wasn't about disrespecting Carter and the press knew exactly what it was saying when it brought it up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  It's about putting our security first. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=301.24s)]
*  Now, remember Congressman Mike Gallagher? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=305.0s)]
*  He was then chair of the select committee on the CCP. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  He laid it all out in stark terms, saying in 2023, a visitor to the Panama Canal might think they were in China. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  Ports at both ends of the canal are managed by companies from the People's Republic of China, while Huawei dominates the country's telecom system. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=317.4s)]
*  Yeah, pretty important, don't you think? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=325.88s)]
*  Since 2018, Panama has been a member of China's Belt and Road Initiative as well. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  And Xi's plan to dominate all global trade is part of this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=333.68s)]
*  So do we really want China dominating a canal that's central to our trade? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=338.4s)]
*  If they take control of enough of Panama, could China ultimately use it as a station for its military? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=344.32s)]
*  These are valid questions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  But again, even raising this issue is somehow an affront to official Washington. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=353.68s)]
*  How dare you stand up for the United States? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=360.2s)]
*  You're threatening the global order, Donald Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=362.8s)]
*  And if Trump can make a deal for strategically important Greenland, why wouldn't that be a good thing? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=366.6s)]
*  We need Greenland for national security purposes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  I've been told that for a long time, long before I even ran. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, people have been talking about it for a long time. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=381.8s)]
*  I'm talking about protecting the free world. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=383.8s)]
*  You look at, you don't even need binoculars. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  You look outside, you have China ships all over the place. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=389.0s)]
*  You have Russian ships all over the place. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=393.64s)]
*  We're not letting that happen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=396.24s)]
*  Again, this is something that's at the media's hair on fire, but Trump's right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  Back in August, a piece in the Harvard International Review explained how China has tried to take hold of Greenland's iron and uranium mining industries. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=402.2s)]
*  And even has Russia involved in the project to establish what they're calling a polar Silk Road. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  That would create Arctic dominance. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=420.24s)]
*  So why is this never mentioned in the media's coverage of Greenland and Trump's desire to perhaps make a deal for it? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=424.2s)]
*  Well, I'll say it's for the same reason. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=432.8s)]
*  They never addressed the fact that NATO is still taking advantage of U.S. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=434.64s)]
*  taxpayers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  NATO is taking advantage of us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=440.28s)]
*  And one of the problems that I have, and I've said it openly, I said it to President Zelensky, Europe is in for a tiny fraction of the money that we're in. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=442.11999999999995s)]
*  Why are we in for billions and billions of dollars more money than Europe? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  Excellent question. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=458.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's a question that makes all the right people uncomfortable, as does Trump's approach to dealing with Russia and his desire to end this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=461.23999999999995s)]
*  horrible war that Biden's incompetence set the stage for. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  Somewhere along the line, Biden said, no, they should be able to join NATO. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=474.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep and I could understand their feeling about that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=478.04s)]
*  But there were a lot of mistakes made in that negotiation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=483.68s)]
*  And when I heard the way that Biden was negotiating, I said, you're going to end up in a war. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=486.72s)]
*  And it turned out to be a very bad war. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=491.6s)]
*  And it could escalate. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=493.16s)]
*  Trump, the peacemaker, wants it to end. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=495.72s)]
*  And of course, he's spot on. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  And in response, the press tiptoed toward Russia collusion again. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  He took Vladimir Putin's side about Ukraine and NATO, saying, I understand why Russia would be mad that some country on its doorstep would join NATO. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  Let me just stop right there, John. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=511.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=513.04s)]
*  Just that quote alone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=514.0s)]
*  Russia's mad and I understand that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=516.6s)]
*  That Russia invaded a democratic nation within Europe. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=519.8s)]
*  And he understands why. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  Imagine that a leader who actually tries to convey an understanding of both sides to reach a peace deal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=526.3599999999999s)]
*  It's called negotiation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=536.0s)]
*  It's called laying the groundwork for a deal. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  Has Biden tried this? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=540.88s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=542.8s)]
*  He's not capable of it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=543.56s)]
*  Biden hasn't even been able to negotiate the release of hostages from the Hamas terrorists. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  He's never scared Hamas. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=551.16s)]
*  They're not worried about Biden. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=553.16s)]
*  What about Trump? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they are. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=556.48s)]
*  When you say all hell must be paid, they don't release the hostages. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=557.92s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=564.0s)]
*  And it will not be good for Hamas. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=569.88s)]
*  And it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=572.4s)]
*  All hell will break out. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=574.28s)]
*  I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=575.68s)]
*  Yeah, he's not going to give you battle plans, but he's conveying his point. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=578.36s)]
*  And I bet Hamas gets it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=582.68s)]
*  Now, Trump displayed this kind of strength. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  Some would call it bravado, but I think it's pragmatic throughout the entire press conference, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  just as he has during his entire life. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=591.84s)]
*  It's why he won the election. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=594.68s)]
*  It's why the media hates him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=596.28s)]
*  So let's be clear what's really going on here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  They're the one, they accuse him of being angry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=601.64s)]
*  They're livid that he's going to be back in office. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=604.68s)]
*  They can't get past themselves in their own anger. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=607.52s)]
*  And apparently the press and some Democrats, most Democrats, expect our leaders [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  to just roll over and to submit to the demands of the elites. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  And any resistance is just met with lies and smears. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=621.76s)]
*  It's dangerously similar to the kind of leadership that we see in places like [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=625.96s)]
*  Russia or Hungary or other places where we have strongmen and oligarchs making [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=631.08s)]
*  decision as opposed to the American people. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=635.64s)]
*  And that's often accompanied by not just corruption, but also oppression of people. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=637.9599999999999s)]
*  They're back to the same thing. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=643.76s)]
*  He's a dictator. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  He just won the election. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  And the Boston Globe columnist, oh no, he's just an autocrat. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  It's not going to work anymore. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  They've learned nothing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=654.88s)]
*  The American people saw through this. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=656.56s)]
*  That's why Trump's going to be back in office in just a week or so. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=659.28s)]
*  Trump's going on a shopping spree. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=662.92s)]
*  He's got his eye on a country, an island and a canal. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=664.56s)]
*  But before he whips out the checkbook, he's rebranding bodies of water. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=672.24s)]
*  which has a beautiful ring that covers a lot of territory. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=680.2s)]
*  The Gulf of America. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=683.6400000000001s)]
*  What a beautiful name. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=684.76s)]
*  And it's appropriate. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  It's appropriate. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=688.44s)]
*  Congress is already drafting a bill to rename the Gulf. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=689.84s)]
*  And why not? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=692.88s)]
*  Democrats renamed Columbus Day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=693.88s)]
*  After that, it's time to buy some real estate. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  The Panama Canal is a disgrace. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=699.4s)]
*  What took place at the Panama Canal? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  We gave it away for a dollar. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=703.0s)]
*  But the deal was that, you know, they have to treat us fairly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=705.24s)]
*  They don't treat us fairly. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=708.92s)]
*  They charge more for our ships than they charge for ships of other countries. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=709.88s)]
*  They charge more for our Navy than they charge for navies of other countries. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=713.96s)]
*  They laugh at us because they think we're stupid, but we're not stupid anymore. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  The canal just jacked up prices. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=723.64s)]
*  And since our ships are the biggest and use it the most, we're the hardest hit. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=725.56s)]
*  We're the victim. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=730.04s)]
*  Like Ronald Reagan said about the canal, we bought it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=732.04s)]
*  We paid for it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=735.16s)]
*  We built it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=736.2s)]
*  The least they could do is give us a discount, but it's not just Panama that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=737.64s)]
*  needs to get it together. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=741.72s)]
*  Canada and the United States, that would really be something. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=744.24s)]
*  You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=748.88s)]
*  looks like. And it would also be much better for national security. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=753.24s)]
*  Don't forget, we basically protect Canada. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=756.5200000000001s)]
*  But here's the problem with Canada. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=759.24s)]
*  So many friends up there. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=761.44s)]
*  I love the Canadian people. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  They're great. But we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=766.0400000000001s)]
*  We have more than they have. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=770.48s)]
*  We don't need anything. So why are we losing $200 billion a year and more to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  protect Canada? And I said that to, as I called them, Governor Trudeau. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=777.48s)]
*  I said, listen, what would happen if we didn't subsidize you? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=782.32s)]
*  Governor Trudeau stepped down yesterday. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=786.76s)]
*  Like Biden, his party turned on him. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=789.84s)]
*  He's not running for reelection and he's being roasted on late night TV. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=792.04s)]
*  Now I want to see you eat it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=796.96s)]
*  Excuse me? The hamburger? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  The Big Mac, the president of all burgers. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=802.04s)]
*  I'm going to make you eat it like a dog with no hands. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=805.4s)]
*  Mon amie, I come to you not on bended knee, but as an equal. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=809.32s)]
*  30% tariff. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=813.12s)]
*  My father taught me to never... [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=814.52s)]
*  50% tariff. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=816.24s)]
*  We Canadians are a heartbeat lot. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=817.68s)]
*  60% tariff. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=819.48s)]
*  For Canada! [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=820.68s)]
*  I'm a hungry little puppy. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=825.52s)]
*  I'm so hungry for my puppy child. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=827.48s)]
*  Trump already picked a replacement for Trudeau. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=830.36s)]
*  I have so many great friends. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  One of them is the great one, Wayne Gretzky. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=836.64s)]
*  I said run for prime minister, you'll win and it'll take two seconds. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=839.64s)]
*  But he said, well, am I going to run for prime minister or governor? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=843.64s)]
*  You tell me. I said, I said, I don't know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=847.08s)]
*  Let's make it governor. I like it better. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=849.4s)]
*  Gretzky has four Stanley cups. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=851.76s)]
*  Trudeau, zero. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not even a question. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=855.84s)]
*  But the governor's trying to hold on to his dignity. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=857.84s)]
*  Today he said there isn't a snowball's chance in hell [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=860.48s)]
*  that Canada would become part of the United States. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=863.24s)]
*  Other Canadian politicians are making counteroffers. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=866.68s)]
*  Hey, Donald, have we got a deal for you? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=870.0s)]
*  You think we want to be the 51st state? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=873.32s)]
*  But maybe California would like to be the 11th province. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=875.88s)]
*  How about it? California? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=879.28s)]
*  Oregon? Washington? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=882.52s)]
*  You know something to the president? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=884.92s)]
*  I'll make him a counteroffer. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=886.44s)]
*  How about if we buy Alaska and we'll throw in Minnesota, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=887.84s)]
*  Minneapolis at the same time? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=890.4s)]
*  No deal. But if you want to take Minneapolis off our hands, she's yours. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=892.2800000000001s)]
*  She's kind of, you know, we're going to interview that Canadian [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=897.24s)]
*  politician in a few minutes, make him an offer he can't refuse. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=901.52s)]
*  But before Trump scoops up Canada, he's scoping out Greenland. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, we need Greenland for national security purposes. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=909.44s)]
*  I've been told that for a long time, long before I even ran. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=912.84s)]
*  I mean, people have been talking about it for a long time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=916.24s)]
*  You have approximately 45000 people there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=918.84s)]
*  People really don't even know if Denmark has an illegal right to it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=922.24s)]
*  But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=927.12s)]

*  You have Russian ships all over the place. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=941.76s)]
*  We're not letting that happen. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=944.36s)]
*  Trump's saying we need Greenland to protect Denmark and the rest of the free world. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=946.36s)]

*  How do you think Denmark would feel then? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=963.48s)]
*  Today, Trump force one took an expeditionary flight to Greenland, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=966.36s)]

*  47 even called in to greet our new family members. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1000.28s)]
*  I just want to say that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1004.64s)]
*  it's a very special place. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1007.32s)]
*  It needs security for itself, but it also needs security very much for the world. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1009.12s)]
*  The location really. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1013.6s)]
*  You see the people and the ships sailing around and they're not the right ships [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1015.36s)]
*  and they're not the ships you want to know about. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1019.92s)]
*  So we need security. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1022.28s)]
*  Our country needs it at all. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1024.36s)]

*  Denmark just doesn't see the potential in Greenland that Trump does. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1029.4s)]
*  He knows what Greenland is capable of, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1033.2800000000002s)]
*  and Greenland will never be able to achieve what it's capable of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1035.5600000000002s)]
*  under the thumb of the Danes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1038.96s)]
*  And the Greenlandians are excited, but the Danish are not. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1041.76s)]
*  I will make it very clear that seen with the eyes of the Danish government, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1047.3200000000002s)]
*  Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  It is a proud people. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1054.68s)]
*  It is a proud people, a language and culture that is their own. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1057.52s)]
*  Greenland is not for sale. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1062.56s)]

*  Denmark can be at the negotiating table, but it's really not their call. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1069.36s)]
*  It's up to the people of Greenland. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1073.56s)]
*  If they hold a vote to come with us, what's Denmark going to do about it? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1075.6s)]
*  We can do things the easy way or the hard way. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1079.76s)]
*  And sometimes Trump prefers the hard way. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1082.48s)]
*  The king of Denmark is posturing to, he changed the royal coat of arms [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1086.0s)]
*  so that the polar bear, which represents Greenland, is much bigger. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1090.08s)]
*  There are also a couple of shirtless guys holding clubs [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1094.56s)]
*  the king made them bigger to. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1097.16s)]
*  Is that a threat? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1099.48s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1101.0s)]
*  Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1102.76s)]
*  you are not going to use military or economic coercion? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1109.8400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1113.24s)]
*  We're not at the stage of gunboat diplomacy yet. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1115.28s)]
*  We're just window shopping. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1119.52s)]
*  The president-elect's a real estate tycoon and he's in a deal-making mood. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1121.4s)]
*  The strategy is to get a better deal for America [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1124.88s)]
*  and create a North American security, energy and trade network [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1127.56s)]
*  that keeps everyone safe, rich and happy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1131.28s)]

*  Geopolitical strategist and friend of the show, Peter Zion, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1137.24s)]
*  says America is not a tiny European power [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1140.48s)]
*  We're not looking to gobble up large chunks of land [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1143.04s)]
*  to feed their pride and empire. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1145.24s)]
*  We're just looking for strategic islands and choke points, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1147.24s)]
*  not to occupy, but to project power from. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1150.24s)]
*  Think of Greenland as a cold Mexico, with barely any population, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1154.24s)]
*  right off the coast of Maine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1159.76s)]
*  Greenland has minerals that China's trying to mine. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1162.0s)]
*  We're not crazy about that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1165.44s)]
*  And we'd like to expand our basing there to compete against Russia [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1167.44s)]
*  in the Arctic and elsewhere. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1170.72s)]
*  Only problem is the Scandinavians aren't going to love this move. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1172.72s)]
*  And we need their help in the Baltics and the North Sea. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1175.96s)]
*  So we're going to have to wheel and deal. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1178.8s)]
*  What about Panama? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1181.24s)]
*  I don't really want to have to occupy a poor, corrupt country [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1183.08s)]
*  run by cartels, but I don't like getting ripped off [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1185.76s)]
*  with high fees every time we sail through. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1188.4s)]
*  So maybe this flex will force them to drop the price. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1190.4s)]
*  I used to love the idea of gobbling up Canada. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1195.0s)]
*  Vast energy reserves doubling our geography. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1198.2s)]
*  We'd never lose another Winter Olympics. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  But do we really want to add that many liberals to our population? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1203.6399999999999s)]
*  Even if we split it into two states, a conservative West and a liberal East, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1207.6s)]
*  because Eastern Canada is so populated, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1212.6s)]
*  it'd be an electoral disaster for Republicans. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1215.0s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  But the Canadians need to shape up when it comes to trade energy and timber. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1219.8s)]
*  I'd still like to add stars to our flag, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1225.28s)]
*  and Canada does seem ripe for the picking. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1227.56s)]
*  Maybe we just take Saskatchewan and Alberta. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1231.04s)]
*  Because the fact that they don't want to become part of America [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1234.72s)]
*  makes me want to make them. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1237.92s)]

*  But first, more from today's wide-ranging press conference, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1304.4s)]
*  including a big new plan to rebrand the Gulf of, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1307.64s)]
*  well, while holding our neighbors to the south and to the north accountable. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1312.44s)]
*  Take a look. You decide. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1316.76s)]
*  We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1318.12s)]
*  to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1322.48s)]

*  And it's appropriate. It's appropriate. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1332.52s)]

*  Donald Trump, he was only getting started. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1364.92s)]
*  It was the president-elect's message to Panama, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1367.24s)]

*  The Panama Canal is a disgrace, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1379.04s)]

*  They violated every aspect of the agreement, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1386.56s)]

*  I said, well, why don't you get the money from China? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1403.8s)]

*  China's at both ends of the Panama Canal. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1408.6s)]

*  They've overcharged our ships, overcharged our Navy. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1413.2s)]
*  And then when they need repair money, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1417.8s)]
*  they come to the United States to put it up. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1419.28s)]

*  Donald Trump also had a message [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1479.88s)]
*  for the current president, Joe Biden, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1481.8s)]

*  America's oil and gas industry. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1486.56s)]

*  the single most energy-rich country on the face of the Earth [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1491.72s)]

*  the incoming administration. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1497.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1498.56s)]
*  They take 625 million acres [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1499.8s)]
*  and they essentially landmark it [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1502.96s)]
*  so you can't ever drill there again. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1505.24s)]

*  Couldn't believe the size of it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1508.24s)]
*  I mean, you put down a map and put this up, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1509.6s)]
*  it's just massive. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1511.8799999999999s)]
*  And remember that that's worth probably, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1514.12s)]
*  I mean, I've had estimates, 40 to $50 trillion. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1518.6000000000001s)]

*  he's taken $50 trillion of value [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1534.4s)]
*  and thrown it right out the window. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1538.16s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1540.8s)]
*  Trump will take it back. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1541.64s)]
*  You'll pay less for gasoline. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1542.72s)]
*  Diesel prices will come down. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1544.28s)]

*  everything you buy and every store you go to [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1548.88s)]

*  That will help inflation. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1551.68s)]
*  That will help the economy. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1552.88s)]
*  That will lower interest rates [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1553.96s)]

*  Are you that small? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1572.44s)]

*  Take a look. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1577.8s)]

*  for five cents on the dollar, by the way. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1581.8s)]
*  And we had fortunately a judge that stopped that, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1584.56s)]
*  but they were already discarding the wall. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1588.6s)]

*  And guess what? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1708.04s)]
*  Forget the doubters, the naysayers, the Trump haters, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1709.52s)]
*  in the media mob, they are irrelevant [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1713.0s)]
*  because legacy media is dead, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1715.6s)]
*  and right now the sky's the limit. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1717.6s)]
*  Yeah, who's your daddy? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1719.16s)]

*  of the Gulf of Mexico to the United States. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1732.76s)]

*  he wants to change New Mexico to the Gulf of America. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1747.76s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1752.76s)]
*  That's not all. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1753.76s)]
*  He also wants to change New Mexico to even better Mexico. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1756.76s)]
*  As for Canada, he plans on renaming it North North Dakota. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1761.76s)]
*  He also suggested changing the Bermuda Triangle [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1769.76s)]
*  to that big, beautiful, sexy triangle [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1772.76s)]
*  in the gorgeous blue Atlantic. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1774.76s)]
*  Finally, he wants to change Samoa to thin mints. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1777.76s)]
*  That was really stupid, but I'm glad you laughed. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1784.76s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1787.76s)]
*  So New York City saw a staggering 146% spike [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1788.76s)]
*  in felony assaults by repeat offenders. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1793.76s)]
*  They also saw a 146% increase in assaults with spikes. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1798.76s)]
*  I'm leaving it in. I don't care. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1808.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, New York City's Transit Chief [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1813.76s)]

*  See, it was worth it, you jerk-offs. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1829.76s)]
*  A group of feral hogs has been terrorizing Irving, Texas, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1833.76s)]
*  tearing up yards and rooting through garbage. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1837.76s)]

*  Yeah, we're back to that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1847.76s)]
*  A massive tuna sold for $1.3 million at a Japanese auction. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1850.76s)]

*  He's a friend. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1859.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1860.76s)]
*  700 former employees are suing McDonald's [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1862.76s)]
*  because their managers demanded sex in exchange for extra hours. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1864.76s)]
*  One thing's for sure, the next time I go to McDonald's, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1869.76s)]
*  I'm going to ask them to hold the special sauce. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1871.76s)]
*  I know. Disgusting. Disgusting. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1876.76s)]
*  Speaking of McDonald's, they're the latest corporation [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1882.76s)]
*  to roll back DEI policies. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1885.76s)]
*  It's a shocker, given they were the first fast food place [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1887.76s)]
*  to hire a person of colour. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1890.76s)]
*  Finally, a Canadian woman experienced rapid breast growth [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1898.76s)]
*  going from a B cup to a triple G [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1903.76s)]
*  due to an adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID shot. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1907.76s)]
*  I think we have a picture of the woman. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1912.76s)]
*  I'm back. It took me two days. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1914.76s)]
*  We tried. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1918.76s)]
*  So it's clear that MAGA may be the most consequential [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1919.76s)]
*  political movement in a century, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1922.76s)]
*  but right now we're experiencing another movement. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1924.76s)]
*  And unlike MAGA, this one really stinks. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1927.76s)]
*  Biden's last PM. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1945.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1953.76s)]
*  You won't see that on the Faulkner Focus. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1955.76s)]
*  So, he's crapping on us, OK? Follow me. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1962.76s)]
*  You saw that Biden just released 11 detainees [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1967.76s)]
*  with suspected al-Qaeda ties from Gitmo, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1970.76s)]
*  including two of Bin Laden's bodyguards. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1972.76s)]
*  I believe we have a picture of the bodyguards right here. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1974.76s)]
*  But wait. As Joy Behar once said [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1980.76s)]
*  after her doctor sawed off a dozen skin tags, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1982.76s)]
*  there's more. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1987.76s)]
*  Joe just banned all drilling offshore, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1991.76s)]
*  and it has nothing to do with Epstein's Island. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1994.76s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1998.76s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=1999.76s)]
*  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Joe. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2001.76s)]
*  Let's make energy prices skyrocket [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2003.76s)]
*  when people are already having a hard time economically. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2005.76s)]
*  He understands the nation like P. Diddy [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2008.76s)]
*  understands the age of consent. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2010.76s)]
*  And yet another bold move guaranteed [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2014.76s)]
*  to restore American greatness, the White House decided [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2016.76s)]
*  to ban natural gas-fired water heaters. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2018.76s)]
*  And here I thought these dipshits loved to gaslight. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2022.76s)]
*  But I don't understand why Joe despises fossil fuels, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2025.76s)]
*  since that's what Joe's gonna be when they cremate him. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2029.76s)]
*  This on top of Biden's commutation [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2036.76s)]
*  of federal death row inmates, ensuring that taxpayers [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2038.76s)]
*  are on the hook for the lifelong care and feeding [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2041.76s)]
*  of murderers and child rapists. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2044.76s)]
*  F***ing Democrats. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2047.76s)]
*  They look at murderers on death row [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2049.76s)]
*  like starving children in Africa [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2051.76s)]
*  for just a few dollars a month. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2054.76s)]
*  You can keep them fed in clothes. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2056.76s)]
*  I'm surprised they don't send us a picture of them every month [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2059.76s)]
*  and a letter telling us how well they're doing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2061.76s)]
*  Dear Greg, I only shanked two guards today, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2064.76s)]
*  and me and the boys are hosting a toilet wine tasting [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2067.76s)]
*  in Cell Block C. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2069.76s)]
*  Think about it, the money that would go to feeding your kid [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2072.76s)]
*  goes to feed a heinous criminal. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2075.76s)]
*  But enough about Liz Cheney's pension. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2078.76s)]
*  Then there's the pardons, including the one he promised us [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2080.76s)]
*  was never coming. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2083.76s)]
*  If you believe that, I've got an MSNBC to sell you. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2085.76s)]
*  We already talked about his medals of freedom. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2089.76s)]
*  What a joke. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2091.76s)]
*  What's next? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2092.76s)]
*  Hunter getting a Purple Heart for getting crabs in the Navy? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2093.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2096.76s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2099.76s)]
*  First, Biden and the Democrats are truly bad at everything, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2101.76s)]
*  including losing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2104.76s)]
*  They've been in the White House for a long time. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2106.76s)]
*  They've been in the White House for a long time, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2108.76s)]
*  including losing. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2110.76s)]
*  They lost, and instead of maybe asking, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2112.76s)]
*  hey, did we misread the room? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2114.76s)]
*  They decided the problem isn't them, it's the room. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2116.76s)]
*  And so what do they do? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2120.76s)]
*  They trash the room, i.e. our country. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2121.76s)]
*  They're like the bitter ex you just dumped [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2124.76s)]
*  who keys your car, poisons the fish in your koi pond, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2127.76s)]
*  burns all your copies of penthouse letters. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2131.76s)]
*  It's the last time I date anyone from Outnumbered. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2134.76s)]
*  And like any bitter ex, they believe we just didn't understand [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2139.76s)]
*  how much they cared about us. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2142.76s)]
*  And we really didn't show the kind of empathy and concern [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2144.76s)]
*  to average, or show enough of it, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2149.76s)]
*  to average working families who didn't realize [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2152.76s)]
*  how much we had done and how much we care for them. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2156.76s)]
*  Really, Penguin? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2161.76s)]
*  What have you done to show that you cared? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2164.76s)]
*  Release criminals, destroy the border, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2167.76s)]
*  defend the butchery of kids? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2169.76s)]
*  The last time somebody cared about me that much, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2171.76s)]
*  I was on Valtrex for three years. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2174.76s)]
*  You want to know the worst part? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2178.76s)]
*  We still don't know who's calling the shots. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2180.76s)]
*  You think Joe actually knew who the killers were? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2182.76s)]
*  Whose sentences he commuted? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2185.76s)]
*  You think he really knew what he was signing [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2187.76s)]
*  when these orders on drilling came through? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2189.76s)]
*  No, he thought he was ordering tapioca pudding for dessert. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2192.76s)]
*  Right now, the White House is essentially a bunch [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2197.76s)]
*  of sullen brats fighting to get daddy to sign a will [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2199.76s)]
*  that gives them all the goodies they ever wanted. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2202.76s)]
*  Out of anger, arrogance, and disbelief [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2205.76s)]
*  that they didn't outsmart all of America, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2208.76s)]
*  they're grabbing what they can as they go out the door [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2210.76s)]
*  like a smash and grab at K. Jewelers. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2213.76s)]
*  Now, they could reflect on what they did wrong and do better, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2216.76s)]
*  but they're not interested in changing, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2219.76s)]
*  only destroying. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2221.76s)]
*  And by doing so, they remind Americans [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2223.76s)]
*  why they went with the other guy. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2225.76s)]
*  It's quite a disparity. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2227.76s)]
*  In this transition, it's a contrast unlike any I've ever seen. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2229.76s)]
*  Have you? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2232.76s)]
*  The incoming guy is determined to do the job for Americans, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2234.76s)]
*  to reciprocate your trust in him. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2237.76s)]
*  You defended him, you fought for him, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2240.76s)]
*  now he's doing what you expect him to do. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2242.76s)]
*  The outgoing guy, he's a cardboard corpse [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2244.76s)]
*  employed by unnamed radicals [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2247.76s)]
*  not to save America, but to punish it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2249.76s)]
*  And you, the American voter, have no impact on their desires. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2251.76s)]
*  But wasn't that always the case with Democrats? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2256.76s)]
*  It's just that now, everyone sees it. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2259.76s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2262.76s)]
*  She was the perfect defense lawyer, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2267.76s)]
*  because she was always appealing. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2270.76s)]
*  Go host about number and everything about Joe. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2272.76s)]
*  He never has to win. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2274.76s)]
*  He never has to worry about reading fan mail. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2278.76s)]
*  Comedian Joe Mackey. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2281.76s)]
*  She's expanding and demanding. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2287.76s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2290.76s)]
*  Kat Jue. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2292.76s)]
*  And he's like a mobility scooter, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2296.76s)]
*  versatile, sturdy, and old ladies want to ride him. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2298.76s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author and comedian, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2302.76s)]
*  and the new A World Senate, Tyrone! [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2306.76s)]
*  Emily, doesn't it feel like Joe Biden's White House [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2311.76s)]
*  is like an ex that is like just burning everything down [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2314.76s)]
*  because of the rejection? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2318.76s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2320.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2322.76s)]
*  It's so patently obvious. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2323.76s)]
*  In a way, look, this sounds terrible, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2325.76s)]
*  but in a way, I sort of like it, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2327.76s)]
*  because for the .0001% of the population [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2329.76s)]
*  that maybe was undecided, that wasn't persuaded, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2332.76s)]
*  that didn't see the light yet, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2334.76s)]
*  can't they see the self-serving destruction [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2336.76s)]
*  that is only because he has said, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2339.76s)]
*  I don't care about anyone anymore. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2342.76s)]
*  I only care about myself. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2343.76s)]
*  But the reality is that hallmarked his entire administration, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2345.76s)]
*  his entire service, and for anyone that was watching, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2347.76s)]
*  the full tenure of service. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2349.76s)]
*  But frankly, all we are seeing is the filter come off, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2351.76s)]
*  the frontal lobe being finally sort of decimated, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2353.76s)]
*  but this guy served himself the whole time. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2356.76s)]
*  He always had a chip on his shoulder. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2358.76s)]
*  But now the thing that I feel also [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2360.76s)]
*  that I have a semblance of like, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2362.76s)]
*  all right, go ahead, have the tantrum. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2364.76s)]
*  You know, you're watching the kid in the corner [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2366.76s)]
*  break the toys. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2367.76s)]
*  Go ahead, because I know that actual dad [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2368.76s)]
*  is going to come in and fix it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2370.76s)]
*  I have such faith and confidence [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2371.76s)]
*  in the people that President Trump has amassed [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2373.76s)]
*  at the people that he is continuing to put [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2375.76s)]
*  in these positions. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2377.76s)]
*  There is no way this final temper tantrum [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2378.76s)]
*  will have lasting results. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2381.76s)]
*  Even with the gulf madness, the drilling madness, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2382.76s)]
*  there will be a way to restore America back to normal. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2385.76s)]
*  So he can go ahead and have his tantrum all he wants, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2388.76s)]
*  because come January 20th, then we're coming back. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2390.76s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope you're right, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2393.76s)]
*  but that's probably a false hope. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2399.76s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2401.76s)]
*  Joe, who's doing this? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2402.76s)]
*  You know, this is what kills me, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2406.76s)]
*  is that the media now admits Joe's not in charge. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2407.76s)]
*  Well, if Joe's not in charge, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2410.76s)]
*  don't you want to know who's doing this stuff? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2411.76s)]
*  Greg, that's a great question. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2413.76s)]
*  Before I get to it, I want to quick fact [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2415.76s)]
*  check on your monologue. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2417.76s)]
*  You said you used Valchex for three years. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2418.76s)]
*  That is a herpes suppression drug, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2421.76s)]
*  which means you are ripe for an outbreak, my friend. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2423.76s)]
*  No more wrestling me in the green room. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2426.76s)]
*  That's how we got it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2428.76s)]
*  Okay, I shouldn't have mentioned that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2433.76s)]
*  But I think it might be Hunter Biden [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2439.76s)]
*  calling the shots right now. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2441.76s)]
*  Like, who would ban oil heaters? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2443.76s)]
*  You know, because they're always sweating. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2446.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2448.76s)]
*  Someone who uses cocaine, maybe? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2449.76s)]
*  But I'll say this. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2452.76s)]
*  The fascinating aspect of all this is that Joe Biden quit. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2454.76s)]
*  We all know he didn't really quit, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2458.76s)]
*  so he's acting like he got fired. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2460.76s)]
*  And as someone who acts horribly when they get fired, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2462.76s)]
*  I can relate to this totally. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2466.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to leave terrible reviews [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2468.76s)]
*  at this steakhouse. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2470.76s)]
*  You're going to wish you never heard the name Axel Mackey. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2471.76s)]
*  Mackey? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2475.76s)]
*  I was during my Beverly Hills cop phase. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2477.76s)]
*  Did you really work at a steakhouse? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2479.76s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2483.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2484.76s)]
*  Yes, I was a waiter. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2485.76s)]
*  Quite a good one, if you ask me. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2486.76s)]
*  I bet. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2488.76s)]
*  But if you asked them, they'd say no. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2489.76s)]
*  They always wanted that the soda they asked for was diet [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2491.76s)]
*  because they were diabetic. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2494.76s)]
*  Wow, Kat, what a comparison. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2498.76s)]
*  I'm much older than you, not by much, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2501.76s)]
*  but I've never seen this kind of transition where it's so stark [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2503.76s)]
*  and just like we're going from... [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2506.76s)]
*  It's almost like we're not going from a president to another president. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2508.76s)]
*  We're going from a type of thinking or a type of living to another. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2511.76s)]
*  It's just hard for me to listen to Joe Biden at this point. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2517.76s)]
*  I mean, not at this point. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2520.76s)]
*  It's been hard for a while, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2521.76s)]
*  but when he was talking about the oil drilling, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2523.76s)]
*  when he was like, you know, in balancing the many uses and benefits, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2525.76s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you lost me there. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2529.76s)]
*  You lost me there. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2531.76s)]
*  I don't think you did that. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2532.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2535.76s)]
*  I don't think you were balancing anything. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2536.76s)]
*  I don't think he was in the library. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2538.76s)]
*  I don't think he was looking at spreadsheets. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2540.76s)]
*  I don't think he was in the laboratory running tests. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2542.76s)]
*  I think someone told him to say it. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2545.76s)]
*  And why are we still wheeling him out there? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2547.76s)]
*  None of it's really believable. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2549.76s)]
*  And why do it? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2552.76s)]
*  Because you can just flip it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2553.76s)]
*  It could just be flipped again. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2554.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2555.76s)]
*  And he's not even bothering to, I don't know, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2556.76s)]
*  hide the fact that he's going to destroy the place. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2559.76s)]
*  That's why I think he's just not there. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2563.76s)]
*  No, he's certainly not. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2565.76s)]
*  I'm starting to think that as well. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2566.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2568.76s)]
*  I think right now Jimmy Carter has more on the ball than him. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2569.76s)]
*  And that's not a joke about Jimmy Carter. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2573.76s)]
*  So send your letters to Joe Mackey. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2576.76s)]
*  Tyrus. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2579.76s)]
*  Axel Mackey. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2580.76s)]
*  Tyrus, do you feel like Trump is starting in a deeper hole because of this? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2581.76s)]
*  No, because, well, here's the sad thing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2585.76s)]
*  Poor Joe never got to be president. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2588.76s)]
*  His entire four years, someone else has been calling the shots. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2591.76s)]
*  And this is, and he's cover. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2595.76s)]
*  He's the shield. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2597.76s)]
*  Because to say with any degree of intelligence that look what Joe is doing to us after watching for three and a half years, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2598.76s)]
*  you need to have your head examined because it's not him. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2605.76s)]
*  And they don't understand because they weren't elected. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2608.76s)]
*  They don't understand the job. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2611.76s)]
*  So they sat around in their little meeting with their chai teas outside of a Starbucks and said, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2614.76s)]
*  what we're going to do is we're going to shut down all the drilling with an executive order. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2619.76s)]
*  And no one says, yeah, but the other guy can come in and just change it. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2623.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2626.76s)]
*  They don't think it's like watching bad villains in like in the Austin Powers. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2627.76s)]
*  There's no Scott telling them, hey, this is stupid. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2631.76s)]
*  They're just going to reverse it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2636.76s)]
*  No, you just don't get it, Carl. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2638.76s)]
*  All right, let's move on then. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhV64waDz4Y&t=2640.76s)]
