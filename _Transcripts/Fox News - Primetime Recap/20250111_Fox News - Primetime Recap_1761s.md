# Fox News Highlights - Jan. 10, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you very much for spending some time with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. Tonight, Trump gets the last laugh against the Democrats. Pathetic lawfare campaign. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=7.0s)]
*  It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election. And obviously that didn't work. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=14.0s)]
*  And Joe Biden is still as delusional as ever. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=21.0s)]
*  I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump. And I think that Kamala could have beaten Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=24.0s)]
*  That's funny for a Friday night. Plus, in moments, legendary actor and director Mel Gibson joins me live after his home was destroyed in the California wildfires. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=31.0s)]
*  And it's another day of wreckage and ruin in Southern California. As the fires continue to decimate the areas around L.A., the infernos have covered more than 35000 acres. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=44.0s)]
*  That's more than twice the size of Manhattan. Now, the Palisades fire has destroyed more than twenty thousand acres. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=55.0s)]
*  It's only eight percent contained. North of that is the Kenneth fire that spans over a thousand acres. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=61.0s)]
*  And then there's the Eaton fire that's out in Pasadena. And that's taken out more than five thousand structures and caused at least two deaths. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=67.0s)]
*  And that's covered more than thirteen thousand acres. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=76.0s)]
*  It's a disaster. It's Armageddon. I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=80.0s)]
*  We're so heartbroken for our neighbors. These were newlyweds just bought this home six months ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=85.0s)]
*  This is honestly probably the worst I've ever seen it. We just don't have enough personnel and whatnot to really contain this one. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=92.0s)]
*  It's not a war zone. It's just a tragedy. These poor people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=98.0s)]
*  And for those whose homes did not burn down, they're at risk of being looted. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=103.0s)]
*  More than 20 people have been arrested so far for doing the unthinkable during a time of such horrific tragedy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=108.0s)]
*  Now, things have gotten so bad that local officials have put a curfew in place. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=115.0s)]
*  It's going to be in effect tonight at six p.m. We are not screwing around with this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=120.0s)]
*  We don't want anyone taking advantage of our residents that have already been victimized. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=125.0s)]
*  They don't put up with that nonsense in Florida. And this was the headline in Sunday's L.A. Times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=131.0s)]
*  L.A. and Ventura counties will see strong winds this week as major risks of fires. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=138.0s)]
*  And now, what is it, four or so days later, the fires that were predicted have killed 11 and destroyed more than 10,000 homes, businesses and schools. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=146.0s)]
*  We've seen the video. The residents, their days, they're confused. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=157.0s)]
*  Many are furious with former officials asking why, given the wind warnings and the dry conditions that Newsom and Karen Bass did not pre position sufficient firefighting resources in the most at risk areas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=161.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, the fire department budget cuts did not help. And the dimwitted DEI hires are way out of their league. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=178.0s)]
*  But even they can see how much the city's liberal leadership has failed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=187.0s)]
*  Fire department needs to be properly funded. And it's not. It's not at this point. Did the city of Los Angeles fail you and your department and our city? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=192.0s)]
*  It's my job to stand up as a chief and exactly say justifiably what the fire department needs to operate to meet the demands of the community. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=200.0s)]
*  Let's get us what we need so our firefighters can do their jobs. Do they fail you? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=210.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=214.0s)]
*  Well, I'm sure she's doing her best. And just when you think you understood the depths of this incompetence, we learned that yesterday the L.A. Emergency Management Office mistakenly started sending out hundreds of thousands of immediate evacuation notices to residents. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=215.0s)]
*  Some of my friends were telling me about this at the time. Residents, by the way, who were not themselves in any danger. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=235.0s)]
*  This happened twice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=241.0s)]
*  I can't express enough how sorry I am for this experience. As these alerts are being issued, they are not being activated or initiated by a person. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=244.0s)]
*  Don't look at me. The machine did it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=257.0s)]
*  Now imagine the panic. Being awakened in the middle of the night with the buzzing on your phone kept buzzing going off, warning you to evacuate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=260.0s)]
*  So some of my friends in the Encino area were in their pajamas throwing whatever they could grab, throw it into their vehicles, only to get another message saying, oops, sorry. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=268.0s)]
*  Do any of these people reassure you? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=281.0s)]
*  Right now, our number one priority is to establish how we can work with our coordination with our federal and state partners, how we can stop the messages that are going out right now that are not being initiated by a human action. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=284.0s)]
*  I can't believe I just heard that. Our priority is to establish, communicate. You still can't master the messaging? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=306.0s)]
*  Now this led to infighting in the city government after the top emergency management officials urged citizens to check in online or to dial 211 if they indeed got these false evacuation alerts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=317.0s)]
*  So it was on you to kind of contact them? Well, this didn't go over so well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=333.0s)]
*  I think that's absolutely ridiculous. And I told Kevin McGowan that to tell people to go on a website when they may not have access to an Internet is absolutely absurd. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=339.0s)]
*  I'm not going to tell people if you get the alert, go on and check. I'm not making any excuses. It's unacceptable. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=349.0s)]
*  A colossal understatement, but yeah, unacceptable. The incompetence almost across the board here is breathtaking. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=355.0s)]
*  But of course, our incompetent president does what he always does. He claims that legitimate questions are just politically motivated. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=365.0s)]
*  Look, you know, I think you're getting a bad rap. I mean, this is complicated stuff. You're going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it, but you're doing the right thing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=373.0s)]
*  Now, the victims need immediate help and we need a lot of answers, including to the question, why was the Pacific Palisades Reservoir offline and empty when the firestorm initially exploded? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=387.0s)]
*  Apparently, we learned today that it was closed for repairs, leaving the area with a deficit of 117 million gallons of available water. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=404.0s)]
*  It's such a calamity that even Gavin Newsom is now calling for an investigation into the water issue that a few days ago we were told wasn't an issue. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=414.0s)]
*  And despite there being zero proof that manmade carbon dioxide caused these fires, Democrats toss out climate change, of course, to deflect responsibility. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=423.0s)]
*  Climate change is real, fundamentally all over, and not just here, but around the world, around the world. What's going on? And we've got to adjust to it. We've got to adjust to it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=433.0s)]
*  And we can't. We have the capacity to respond to it if we in fact exercise our good judgment. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=447.0s)]
*  Good judgment? Coming from a guy who thinks he just attended Nixon's funeral. We're going to listen to him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=454.0s)]
*  But still, believe them when they tell you what their plans are. You heard him say, we've got to adjust to this climate change. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=461.0s)]
*  Now, beware when the media also starts citing unnamed climate experts. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=471.0s)]
*  I've been speaking to a lot of people this morning and they say basically this whole fire should be a wake up call of how we construct our cities. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=477.0s)]
*  Right now we're still under the misapprehension that the climate is the same as it was in the last century. It's not. They say for this century we need a radical rethink of how we structure our cities, how we build our homes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=485.0s)]
*  I fully expect that the same buffoons who got us into this mess will try to use this catastrophe to rezone certain residential neighborhoods. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=500.0s)]
*  And then to burden rebuilding with more red tape. The red tape should be cut here and you should streamline the permitting process, but that's not going to be done. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=510.0s)]
*  But perhaps this reimagining cities will work to achieve this epic dream of theirs for more high density housing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=520.0s)]
*  Putting single family homes out of reach for victims and everyone, but really the super rich. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=529.0s)]
*  All to protect us. It's for your own good from the ravages of climate change. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=534.0s)]
*  But instead Californians and all Americans need to protect themselves from these incompetent woke officials. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=540.0s)]
*  Their radicalism and their ineptitude has devastated a great state and now it's actually destroying lives. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=547.0s)]
*  Dei as Elon Musk said can actually mean D I E. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=554.0s)]
*  These people cannot rebuild the trust they lost. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=559.0s)]
*  Don't let them tell you how to rebuild your homes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=563.0s)]
*  Oh, we had a whole house. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=568.0s)]
*  Now we have nothing. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=573.0s)]
*  That was our chimney where Santa comes and goes. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=575.0s)]
*  Now we have nothing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=578.0s)]
*  That was our chimney where Santa comes and now it's gone. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=580.0s)]
*  Everything that we built here to just be gone. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=587.0s)]
*  Everyone has lost everything here. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=593.0s)]
*  I have to start all over again. I can't. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=598.0s)]
*  We have fire up Hays and his ranch. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=602.0s)]
*  The family is the most important thing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=604.0s)]
*  A nightmare that no one can wake up from. That's what they're saying in L.A. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=610.0s)]
*  At least 11 people are dead and even more missing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=615.0s)]
*  A chunk of land the size of San Francisco has been destroyed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=618.0s)]
*  Some of the most beautiful land in the world. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=622.0s)]
*  Parts of Pacific Palisades look like Hiroshima after the atomic bomb. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=624.0s)]
*  Entire communities decimated. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=629.0s)]
*  And now the Dino at about a dozen homes are left in a neighborhood of five thousand people. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=631.0s)]
*  Three major fires are still uncontained as crews are bracing for another weekend of the powerful Santa Ana winds. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=637.0s)]
*  On the streets it's turning into the wild wild west looters on scooters ransacking homes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=644.0s)]
*  Thieves are dashing through rubble and ash with flat screens. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=651.0s)]
*  Some of them disguised as fire officials and utility workers. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=654.0s)]
*  The looting is so out of hand that some residents are scared to leave their burned out homes. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=657.0s)]
*  The governor Newsom says looting will not be tolerated. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=663.0s)]
*  These communities have suffered enough. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=667.0s)]
*  Well unless they loot less than nine hundred and fifty dollars then Gavin doesn't mind. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=669.0s)]
*  One of the Winklevoss twins called out Newsom saying this quote. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=674.0s)]
*  You and your party have been tolerating looting for years. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=678.0s)]
*  You normalize this behavior and lawlessness. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=682.0s)]
*  You are a disgrace. Resign now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=683.0s)]
*  It's a free for all in L.A. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=685.0s)]
*  Every man for themselves literally. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=687.0s)]
*  Yesterday local residents had to take down a vagrant with a blowtorch. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=690.0s)]
*  They witnessed him setting fire to old Christmas trees and garbage cans. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=694.0s)]
*  Neighbors called 9 1 1 and before the police arrived they detained them with zip ties and a rope. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=698.0s)]
*  A good old fashioned citizens arrest. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=704.0s)]
*  Here's LAPD. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=707.0s)]
*  What we know right now is that the. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=709.0s)]
*  Incident occurred started here and about 20 minutes 30 minutes later a suspect was detained over in Willing Hills area by citizens. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=710.0s)]
*  So someone purposely set the kind of fire. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=720.0s)]
*  At this time that's what we believe. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=723.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=725.0s)]
*  Do you know how or why they did that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=726.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=728.0s)]
*  Is this a crime scene right now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=730.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=732.0s)]
*  So everything's closed off. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=734.0s)]
*  It's being yes it's being investigated as a crime. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=736.0s)]
*  Police brought him down to the station and a few hours later released him back onto the streets. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=737.0s)]
*  They said there was no probable cause to charge him with arson. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=743.0s)]
*  Even though there was a half a dozen witnesses who saw him setting things on fire and the guy to blowtorch on him when they arrested him. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=746.0s)]
*  That's not probable cause. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=753.0s)]
*  So what was he doing with the blowtorch lighting a blunt. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=755.0s)]
*  If this wasn't. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=759.0s)]
*  A homeless guy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=761.0s)]
*  A homeless guy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=762.0s)]
*  I'm not sure because homeless accounted for over half of the fires in L.A. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=763.0s)]
*  Based on that statistic there's a strong probability that a homeless guy burned the city down. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=769.0s)]
*  But we're waiting for the investigation to play out. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=773.0s)]
*  Homes have been completely toasted and some people say it feels intentional. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=776.0s)]
*  Here's Mel Gibson. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=781.0s)]
*  It's very sad and there were many things you know gone in the blaze that you know I've thought about since I thought oh damn you know that's that's too bad. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=783.0s)]
*  But you know works of art photographs rare books you know old books. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=790.0s)]
*  Some as old as you know 1600 you know like crazy. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=798.0s)]
*  Irreplaceable. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=801.0s)]
*  And irreplaceable stuff. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=803.0s)]
*  California has a lot of problems that sort of baffled the mind as far as why they do things. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=806.0s)]
*  And then in the events like this you sort of look. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=813.0s)]
*  Is it on purpose. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=817.0s)]
*  All these fires should have been contained within 24 hours. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=820.0s)]
*  It's the duty of a politician to prepare for the worst. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=823.0s)]
*  And everyone saw this fire coming. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=826.0s)]
*  I talked to a fireman once. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=829.0s)]
*  This is one of the reasons it freaked me out. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=831.0s)]
*  He goes dude one day he goes it's just going to be the right wind and fires going to start in the right place and it's going to burn through L.A. all the way to the ocean and it's not a thing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=833.0s)]
*  We can do about it. I go really. He goes yeah we're just we just get lucky. He goes we get lucky with the wind. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=843.0s)]
*  He goes with the wind hits the wrong way. It's just going to burn straight through L.A. and it's not going to be a thing we could do about it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=850.0s)]
*  So how well was California prepared. Last week the reservoir and Pacific Palisades was completely empty. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=855.0s)]
*  There was no water. It could have been filled with one hundred and seventeen million gallons of water. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=863.0s)]
*  Instead it was dry and closed for repairs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=869.0s)]
*  They closed the Pacific Palisades reservoir during the season when the Santa Ana winds blow the hardest and now the whole town's barbecued and L.A.'s waters are new it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=871.0s)]
*  She basically watched them drain it. That's according to the Daily Mail. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=883.0s)]
*  Janice Keone's gets paid three quarters of a million dollars a year. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=887.0s)]
*  Wonder how she got that job. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=892.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom also cut the fire budget by a hundred million dollars last year and then vetoed a bill that would have given fire department more seasonal workers when they were short staffed like now. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=894.0s)]
*  L.A. Mayor Karen Bass cut her fire department's budget to L.A. couldn't even get a simple evacuation alert right. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=906.0s)]
*  Last night the whole county panicked. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=914.0s)]
*  We're just mapping out here are under mandatory evacuations and obviously you can hear all of our phones are going off some type of alert evacuation warning it looks like. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=917.0s)]
*  Yeah my alert reads this is an emergency message from the L.A. County Fire Department and evacuation warning has been issued in your area. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=928.0s)]
*  Yeah. Remains is what this looks like. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=937.0s)]
*  Remain vigilant of any threats and be ready to evacuate gather loved ones pets and supplies continue to monitor local weather news and the Web page alert L.A. dot org for more information. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah. So these alerts come based on where you are like on my phone. Yeah. And here we are in West L.A. and we're getting an alert. We'll have to look into why. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=950.0s)]
*  Guess what. False alarm. No need to evacuate. The city said sorry it was an accident. They're going to get people heart attacks. People are leaping into their EVs and speeding out of town. Oops. Never mind. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=959.0s)]
*  Nothing. I mean nothing has gone right. The fire chief of L.A. Kristen says the mayor's failed her. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=974.0s)]
*  Did the city of Los Angeles fail you and your department and our city. It's my job to stand up as a chief and exactly say justifiably what the fire department needs to operate to meet the demands of the community. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=983.0s)]
*  That is our job. And I tell you that's why I'm here. So let's get us what we need so our firefighters can do their jobs. Did they fail you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=998.0s)]
*  Yes. Over the last three years been been clear that the fire department needs help. We can no longer sustain where we are. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1006.0s)]
*  But for some reason and I think we know why the mayor and the governor are still getting a pass for most of the legacy press. Listen to a governor who's grappled with his share of disasters. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1016.0s)]
*  If Newsom was a Republican you guys would go try that you would have it nailed to the wall for what they're doing over there. When we had the Surfside tower collapse I had people from the Washington Post trying to blame me for it immediately without having any facts. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1027.0s)]
*  That mayor of L.A. If that were a Republican mayor I could only imagine what that would do. I mean you know the fires are at high risk and you try to go to Africa. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1043.0s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom says none of this is my fault. The real battle we need to wage here is against the people blaming me. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1053.0s)]
*  We've got to deal with this misinformation. There are hurricane force winds of mis and disinformation lies. People want to divide this country and we have to address that as well. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1062.0s)]
*  And it breaks my heart as people are suffering and struggling that we're up against those hurricane force forces as well. And that's just a point of personal privilege that I share that with you because it infects real people that are out there. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1073.0s)]
*  People I meet every single day. People the mayor has been meeting with and they're having conversations that are not the typical conversations you'd have at this time. And you wonder where this stuff comes from. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1089.0s)]
*  And it's very damaging as well. This is what Democrats do. They screw up and then call their critics liars. But this time that's hard to do when your whole city is still on fire. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1100.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear politicians whine about misinformation during a crisis. People have lost their homes and everything in it. Their most cherished belongings their great grandfathers watch their mother's wedding ring. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1112.0s)]
*  Priceless family heirlooms. Some have no insurance. The home is all they had and they turn on TV and the governor is complaining about his approval rating and what someone wrote in the comments section. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1126.0s)]
*  This fire has unleashed a fury in Hollywood. Actors and actresses who would never dare attack a Democrat because it could cost them their jobs are lacing into Gavin. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1140.0s)]
*  Here's actress Sarah Foster quote We pay the highest taxes in California. Our fire hydrants were empty. Our vegetation was overgrown brush not cleared. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1153.0s)]
*  Our reservoirs were emptied by our governor because tribal leaders wanted to save fish. Our fire department budget was cut by our mayor. But thank God drug addicts are getting their drug kits. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1162.0s)]
*  L.A. Mayor and Gavin Newsom resign. Your far left policies have ruined our state and also our party. Even Morning Joe can't defend us. And they've defended everything. I mean everything. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1174.0s)]
*  We don't know the exact causes for the complete failure of government to be able to protect these homes. I don't think we can say it's a smelt alone. We don't know what it is. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1187.0s)]
*  But I do think it's going to be like Hurricane Katrina. I mean there's that infrastructure has been slashed. It's hard to hear people say in the richest cities in the world that we just we don't have enough water to protect people. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1201.0s)]
*  We're witnessing the collapse of liberal society. Everything's on fire falling apart at the same time because of stupidity corruption and radical priorities. Reservoirs are bone dry but California Democrats are spending millions on D.E.I. migrants and drug addicts. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1212.0s)]
*  Now primetime tried to save California. Remember the last couple of years. We finally threw up our hands and said we can't save it if they don't want to be saved. After 30,000 acres have been torched and the fire is still not contained in the capital of Sacramento. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1227.0s)]
*  They just called an emergency session to battle Trump. Is now the time to call for a vote. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1244.0s)]
*  This is a historic event. These wildfires as I mentioned are going to be quite possibly a big event. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1251.0s)]
*  This is a historic event. These wildfires as I mentioned are going to be quite possibly some of the worst wildfires and disasters in the state. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1257.0s)]
*  While people are trying to understand what's going on and are worried about disaster relief, worried about the ability to get homeowners insurance, your chamber gabbled into a special legislative session to prepare for Donald Trump. Again, is now the right time for that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1284.0s)]
*  So certainly our focus right now is speaker Ashley. At this moment my colleagues and I we are acting with great urgency, great urgency to ensure that we're providing much needed relief. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1298.0s)]
*  Liberal society has gone mad. People have been institutionalized for less. California has been trying for years to destroy Western civilization. Well, this is what it looks like. They finally did it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1307.0s)]
*  Prime time's calling for a federal takeover of California. When a state becomes this dangerous and the government becomes this reckless, where the lives of millions of American citizens are being destroyed, their homes obliterated, their infrastructure [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1321.0s)]
*  annihilated. We can't wait for a recall election. This is an issue of national security. This is a public health emergency. We know they have public health emergency powers. Remember the pandemic? Invoke them. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1336.0s)]
*  The elected officials in California can't be trusted. They're criminally negligent. Look at what we're seeing. This is a war scene. And if anyone thinks that people who are responsible for this catastrophe are going to somehow rebuild, you're out of your mind. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1351.0s)]
*  If they're left in charge to rebuild L.A., they're going to steal the money. Nothing's going to get rebuilt. Everyone's going to get screwed. This is biblical level destruction. And the city of L.A. is hosting the Olympics in four years. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1367.0s)]
*  There's no way we can showcase L.A. to the world. A full federal takeover is needed. Invoke the Stafford Act. The state's overwhelmed. Martial law might have to be declared. Prime time praise for the poor people of L.A. and hope we can put out this fire before it's too late. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1382.0s)]
*  We begin with good news tonight. Against all odds, after years of sketchy warrants, subpoenas, early morning raids, dozens of cooked up charges one after another, far left judges and Trump hating juries, Donald Trump has eviscerated the left's lawfare campaign. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1401.0s)]
*  Today, New York Judge, Democratic donor Juan Mershon, announced that Trump would receive no jail time, no fine, no probation after a Manhattan jury convicted Trump on what is a novel, bizarre legal theory surrounding a case that had no victims. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1421.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a legal NDA put together by a lawyer and it was chronicled as a legal expense. Judge Mershon told Trump, sir, I wish you Godspeed as you assume your second term in office. It was almost laughable. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1437.0s)]
*  But despite no penalty at all, Donald Trump will rightly appeal this bogus conviction. At his sentencing, the president-elect blasting the left their attempts to weaponize our system of justice. Take a look. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1451.0s)]
*  This has been a very terrible experience. I think it's been a tremendous setback for New York and the New York court system. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1464.0s)]
*  This is a case that Alvin Bragg did not want to bring. He thought it was from what I read and from what I hear, inappropriately handled before he got there. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1472.0s)]
*  A gentleman from a law firm came in and acted as a district attorney. And that gentleman, from what I heard, was a criminal or almost criminal in what he did. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1489.0s)]
*  It was very inappropriate. It was a somebody involved with my political opponent. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1502.0s)]
*  I think about legal expenses are down as legal expenses. And and I get indicted for business records. Everybody should be so accurate. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1509.0s)]
*  It's been a political witch hunt. It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election. And obviously that didn't work. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1518.0s)]
*  And the people of our country got to see this firsthand because they watched the case in your courtroom. They got to see this firsthand. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1526.0s)]
*  And then they voted and I won and got the largest number of votes by far of any Republican candidate in history and won, as you know, all seven swing states, one conclusively, all seven swing states and won the popularity, the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1533.0s)]
*  And they've been watching your trial. So they understood it with all that's happening in our country today with a city that's burning to the ground. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1554.0s)]
*  One of our largest, most important cities burning to the ground with with wars that are uncontrollably going on with all of the problems of inflation and attacks on countries and all of the horrible things that are going on. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1562.0s)]
*  I got indicted over calling a legal expense a legal expense. And the people of this country understand what's going on. This has been a weaponization of government. They call it lawfare. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1578.0s)]
*  Never happened to any extent like this, but never happened in our country before. And I just like to explain that I was treated very, very unfairly. And I thank you very much. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1588.0s)]
*  All right. Trump hating Democrats. They tried to throw the former president in prison. They wanted to send him to Rikers Island. They wanted to ruin his life. They did try to destroy his reputation all in order to block him from winning an election. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1600.0s)]
*  This is a massive scandal, one of the biggest in modern American history and the media. They're perfectly fine with it. These Democrats utterly failed. And now it's time for reckoning at the DOJ, the FBI and the clown shows that are going on in Atlanta and New York. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1616.0s)]
*  Now, I don't mean that Republicans should follow suit. No, they should end the weaponization of justice. They should adhere to equal justice and application of our laws return to constitutional order. They shouldn't do to them. And they're scared to death that that would happen. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1634.0s)]
*  That which was done to Donald Trump. The left tried to turn our courts, the FBI, our intelligence community into a Soviet style political enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. Thankfully, that'll end in what? 12 days, whatever it is on January 20th. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1650.0s)]
*  If you are a Democrat and you're watching tonight, pay close attention. In this country, crimes get prosecuted, not people in this country. Justice is supposed to be blind. We're supposed to have equal justice under the law without political bias. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1667.0s)]
*  Far left bureaucrats that live in D.C. do not get to anoint our leaders and make our laws. And American presidents are supposed to lead and not take orders in between their naps from a group of unelected, overeducated socialists that have an agenda. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1685.0s)]
*  This is a Democratic Republic. It must remain one. It's supposed to be by, of and for the people. And our rights are enshrined by a creator. Not the thing, Joe. Anyway, the left tried to criminalize Donald Trump's free expression in the whole process. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKzI3Yo1yZk&t=1703.0s)]
*  Block is right to participate in our elections. And in the process, they ended up putting Donald Trump and his supporters through hell. This can never happen again.
