# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 19, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s)
*  And that brings us to swamp games. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=2.0s)]
*  Now, as I just said, we've seen this spending charade before. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=4.0s)]
*  And the DC corruptocrats, they usually win. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=9.0s)]
*  But let's look at the good side tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=12.0s)]
*  The swamp creatures, they always scatter and scream when they're under a spotlight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=15.0s)]
*  May not actually win this time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=19.0s)]
*  It may not be able to ram through the usual last-minute bloated yuletide spenderoo. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=22.0s)]
*  Even after all the messiness of today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=28.0s)]
*  But I think the swamp has to have forgotten along the way that Donald Trump and Doge, his crew, could actually read the bill. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=31.0s)]
*  They were betting on everyone just wanting to rush to the doors for Christmas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=38.0s)]
*  But what happened was social media, as Elon Musk noted tonight, social media was used for its best purpose, to reveal the truth to the American people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=44.0s)]
*  In this case, the horrors that Chip Roy was talking about within that bill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=54.0s)]
*  It was teeming with non-essential junk. We talked about it last night. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=58.0s)]
*  But of course, the Democrats, when this was all unraveling, they didn't respond by defending the bill itself because it's indefensible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=62.0s)]
*  All they could do is find a new villain. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=71.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Elon Musk presidency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=74.0s)]
*  Clearly what Elon Musk wants, Elon Musk is going to get. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=76.0s)]
*  For President Musk to come in at the last moment and blow up the deal is just intolerable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=80.0s)]
*  A non-elected billionaire, Elon Musk, has weighed in now and has put forth a message on Twitter from his phone that it's okay to shut the government down and to disregard the bipartisan deal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=87.0s)]
*  The public is not going to tolerate that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=104.0s)]
*  Of course, none of that, none of that holds at all. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=107.0s)]
*  And I'll say this, when you're going after one private citizen, even if it's Musk with all of his money, for exercising his First Amendment rights, you have no argument. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=110.0s)]
*  And any attempt to pit Musk against Trump is just stupid. It's goofy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=122.0s)]
*  The truth is the Democrats have lost control of this narrative and the purse strings. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=127.0s)]
*  And when you've lost that, you've lost everything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=132.0s)]
*  The world playbook of intimidating Republicans to blow billions on wasteful projects. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=135.0s)]
*  It hasn't worked despite their best attempts today. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=140.0s)]
*  Republicans are in shambles over in the House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=144.0s)]
*  The only way to get things done is through bipartisanship. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=147.0s)]
*  The only way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=152.0s)]
*  Let me repeat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=154.0s)]
*  The only way to get things done is through bipartisanship. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=155.0s)]
*  Well, those lines of attack, though, are no longer potent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=159.0s)]
*  When Americans are kept in the loop on the dirty details of legislation or what they claim to be the best thing for the American public, we saw it also happen during covid. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=164.0s)]
*  What eventually happens and sometimes now faster than than everyone would like. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=175.0s)]
*  But the American people start ignoring the liberal spin and then they reject the shakedown. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=180.0s)]
*  That is awesome. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=186.0s)]
*  Now, viewers of the angle were familiar with this con, even from establishment Republicans when they tried to pull it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=189.0s)]
*  Remember, they went after us at the angle and Donald Trump after that for targeting that disastrous bipartisan infrastructure bill. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=196.0s)]
*  It was supported by the likes of Republican Senator from Louisiana, Bill Cassidy, a total disaster. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=204.0s)]
*  And then remember the Horrid Langford Schumer immigration bill that we fought against? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=211.0s)]
*  Well, the establishment, they've always, always feared the dissemination of the truth. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=217.0s)]
*  And Trump, they hate him because he's an outspoken leader. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=223.0s)]
*  He's a truth teller and a truth seeker. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=227.0s)]
*  Had he not spoken out against the spending bill last night and Elon Musk and Vance and Vivek not revealed what was in that bill for just regular people who don't have time to focus on this? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=229.0s)]
*  It would have surely been, you know, I think charged to the tab of the taxpayer right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=242.0s)]
*  It would already be a done deal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=247.0s)]
*  So that in itself is a victory. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=249.0s)]
*  So this process is ugly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=252.0s)]
*  It's very ugly. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=254.0s)]
*  You heard Chad describing it early on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=255.0s)]
*  Spending is not supposed to happen this way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=257.0s)]
*  Congress is supposed to pass 12 discrete spending bills. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=260.0s)]
*  Not this nonsense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=265.0s)]
*  But what does this episode show us? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, it shows us that this is the way they like it because then there's no transparency. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=269.0s)]
*  They don't want any transparency. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=273.0s)]
*  They like it this way. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=275.0s)]
*  At least most of them do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=276.0s)]
*  But it also shows us that from sanctuary cities to Fulton County to more on Fannie. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=278.0s)]
*  We'll also talk about later in the show the frauds who've been running the country and running its institutions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=284.0s)]
*  They're on their heels now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=291.0s)]
*  And it's all because of Donald Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=293.0s)]
*  Without Trump at the helm, and he'll be at the helm in just a month or so, they get away with all of this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=296.0s)]
*  They get away with Fannie Willis is a great patriot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=303.0s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=307.0s)]
*  The charges against Trump are serious. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=309.0s)]
*  You know, they get away with the border is secure. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=311.0s)]
*  They get away with saying that sanctuary cities are just and fair. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=313.0s)]
*  They get away with saying we have to we have to pass this bill even if we don't know what's in it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=318.0s)]
*  They get away with all of that because of no transparency. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=323.0s)]
*  But Donald Trump says, no, no, no, it's time to save the country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=327.0s)]
*  And you save it first with an educated electorate. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=331.0s)]
*  And that's forceful. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=335.0s)]
*  That's powerful to do that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=337.0s)]
*  That is the way to turn things around. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=339.0s)]
*  That is a recipe for success. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=342.0s)]
*  From the border to restoring trust in the courts to restoring the proper legislative process. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=344.0s)]
*  We got to do it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=352.0s)]
*  Sunlight is the best disinfectant. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=354.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=356.0s)]
*  Let me tell you a little story about Washington case. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=357.0s)]
*  You missed it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=359.0s)]
*  This is what's been happening in the last 24 hours. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=360.0s)]
*  The 1500 page spending bill that Congress tried to jam in yesterday just got hacked down to 116 pages. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=363.0s)]
*  Congress just cut 1400 pages of spending. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=370.0s)]
*  I've never witnessed that before, but I've been doing this for over 20 years. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=373.0s)]
*  Kamala's electric bus program, gone. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=377.0s)]
*  The $15 million to make recycling more accessible, that's gone. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=380.0s)]
*  The 12 bio labs, vax mandates, gain of function, gone. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=385.0s)]
*  The law that puts them above the law, you know, so you can't look at Congress's emails, gonezo. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=390.0s)]
*  The Obamacare exemption for members of Congress, that's gone too. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=395.0s)]
*  Oh, and the $6,000 pay raise they were going to try to give themselves. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=400.0s)]
*  No more. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=404.0s)]
*  But they did keep the $3 million to inspect the molasses inspectors. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=406.0s)]
*  Nothing's worse than bad molasses. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=410.0s)]
*  Can't take that risk. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=412.0s)]
*  Huge loss for the molasses lobby. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=414.0s)]
*  Big molasses, not happy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=416.0s)]
*  Either way, it was a big win for Trump and Doge. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=418.0s)]
*  And this is the best Congress is going to do. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=422.0s)]
*  The plan that's on the table currently to keep our government open, but also the promise from the only president in my lifetime [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=425.0s)]
*  who's ever followed through on all of his campaign promises to the American people. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=433.0s)]
*  Excuse me, I'm not done talking. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=437.0s)]
*  Give me the same respect we give you guys. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=439.0s)]
*  The deal on the table will keep the government open for the American people, and if you guys so choose to shut it down, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=441.0s)]
*  it will be on you but not the Republican Party. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=447.0s)]
*  We will not be going back to the table. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=450.0s)]
*  This deal stands as it is, so let you go back home on Christmas and explain to your people why you shut down the government, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=452.0s)]
*  because we won't be doing it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=458.0s)]
*  When Democrats found out the news that they weren't going to get a raise and they weren't going to be able to opt out of Obamacare, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=461.0s)]
*  they started chanting, hell no, inside of their little meeting room. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=467.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're chanting when they don't get their way. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=472.0s)]
*  They're chanting. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=474.0s)]
*  Grown-ups are chanting. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=475.0s)]
*  The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=478.0s)]
*  It's laughable. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=484.0s)]
*  Extreme mega-Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=486.0s)]
*  Not serious? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=491.0s)]
*  Democrats wanted to spend $100 million on migrant farm workers, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=492.0s)]
*  so Gavin Newsom didn't have to pay people to step on his grapes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=496.0s)]
*  Axios calls it a breathtaking preview of the new power centers that will rewire Washington, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=500.0s)]
*  beginning with Trump's inauguration 32 days from now. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=507.0s)]
*  The Trump team says it's the new playbook. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=511.0s)]
*  We don't have to wait that long to figure out what's in these secret spending bills anymore. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=514.0s)]
*  We can read it on the Internet, and Musk can use his megaphone to blast out what's in it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=518.0s)]
*  The American people don't have to be held hostage anymore to backroom deals the week before Christmas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=522.0s)]
*  Taxpayers shouldn't get stuck up and have our money wasted on donor pet projects so politicians can get re-elected. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=528.0s)]
*  We're catching these shady politicians in the act now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=536.0s)]
*  Vance barged into Mike Johnson's office in the middle of the night, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=539.0s)]
*  and in 48 hours, the bill died and a new one was born, and the American people had more of a say. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=543.0s)]
*  And this just did. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=551.0s)]
*  The new bill is dead. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=554.0s)]
*  Only two Democrats voted for it, and 38 Republicans voted against it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=556.0s)]
*  The Republicans didn't like that it raised the debt ceiling without enough spending to make up for it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=562.0s)]
*  Hey guys, the debt ceiling is going to get raised. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=567.0s)]
*  Everybody knows it, and if you want spending cuts, which we all do, you've had a month to hash it out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=570.0s)]
*  You're supposed to go into a room together, outline the cuts, outline the spending, and stick together. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=576.0s)]
*  That's what political parties are supposed to do. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=582.0s)]
*  But you're leaving this all to the last second like a bunch of kids. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=585.0s)]
*  So if they can't get it done, they're going to shut down the government. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=589.0s)]
*  The Democrats are about to shut the government down unless they get a raise. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=593.0s)]
*  Democrats just voted against disaster relief, aid for farmers, pay for the military, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=597.0s)]
*  and to keep the government open because the bill didn't have their pork and a pay raise. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=603.0s)]
*  Our friend Newt Gingrich has said that there have been 21 shutdowns since 1976. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=608.0s)]
*  Anyone remember any of those? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=614.0s)]
*  Country survived all of them. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=616.0s)]
*  Something tells me we're going to see a lot more shutdowns during the second Trump term. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=618.0s)]
*  It was a bipartisan agreement. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=624.0s)]
*  This is done. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=626.0s)]
*  Everyone's packing up their offices, making their Christmas travel plans, and all of a sudden it wasn't done. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=627.0s)]
*  Buckle up, everyone. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=633.0s)]
*  This is probably what governing looks like in 2025. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=635.0s)]
*  Both parties cooked up an ugly $100 billion bill in the back room, and it got blown up because it was full of trash. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=638.0s)]
*  And the media's mad. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=645.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=647.0s)]
*  Because Congress might have to change their Christmas travel plans? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=649.0s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=652.0s)]
*  This is their job. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=653.0s)]
*  What does Jen Psaki care that a congressman had to reschedule their flight back to Michigan? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=655.0s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=660.0s)]
*  MSNBC's worried that things are not going smoothly, so we should just keep doing what we've been doing for the last four years. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=662.0s)]
*  That hasn't worked, Jenny. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=669.0s)]
*  That's why Biden lost? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=671.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's checked out and he's not even negotiating the spending bill. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=673.0s)]
*  Every day more and more. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=677.0s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=679.0s)]
*  It is shocking Biden's absence. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=681.0s)]
*  Like, part of me wonders, like, where's your manhood? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=683.0s)]
*  Like, I can't see George W. Bush or Bill Clinton allowing the incoming president to dominate. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=686.0s)]
*  Where's Biden's pride? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=695.0s)]
*  Democrats have the White House and the Senate, and Trump, Musk, and Johnson are calling the shots. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=697.0s)]
*  And Democrats know it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=702.0s)]
*  The media isn't even reporting what's in the bill. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=704.0s)]
*  The media, just like they hid Biden, just like they hid the laptop, they're covering this whole thing up. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=707.0s)]
*  And the Democrats are mad that Musk put a spotlight on the spending that caused this inflation. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=712.0s)]
*  This is an unelected oligarch who appears to be running our government. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=717.0s)]
*  He's not just Trump's co-president. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=724.0s)]
*  I think that's way too low a title. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=726.0s)]
*  He's the head dude in charge. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=729.0s)]
*  And eventually they're going to have to get together and decide who the president is. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=732.0s)]
*  These guys are just trying to pit Trump and Musk against each other like a little soap opera because they have nothing else to do. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=736.0s)]
*  Trump and Musk are working on behalf of the American people, unlike Nancy and Joe, who haven't spoken since the coup. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=742.0s)]
*  And Soros has been running the Democratic Party for two decades. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=748.0s)]
*  Musk hasn't spent a fraction of what Soros has. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=752.0s)]
*  And he's not electing prosecutors to spark a crime wave. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=756.0s)]
*  And what do you mean decide who the president is? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=759.0s)]
*  Democrats let Clooney, an actor, decide Biden isn't president anymore. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=763.0s)]
*  And the view just hatched a new conspiracy theory. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=768.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=772.0s)]
*  I think Elon Musk believes he's president. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=773.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=776.0s)]
*  Well, you've been calling him vice president. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=777.0s)]
*  I've called him vice president. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=778.0s)]
*  I called him president because I don't know what JD is doing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=780.0s)]
*  I hardly ever say. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=783.0s)]
*  I don't remember last time we even talked about JD. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=784.0s)]
*  He's planning the presidency when they get rid of Trump. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=787.0s)]
*  So you think it's Musk and Musk Vance? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=791.0s)]
*  Possible. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=793.0s)]
*  Hey, you know who? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=794.0s)]
*  Stay away from the stairways. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=798.0s)]
*  You know, people put their leg out to trippy boy down the stairs. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=800.0s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=806.0s)]
*  So Vance and Musk are going to gang up and knock out Trump. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=807.0s)]
*  Ladies, we don't do coups. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=811.0s)]
*  You do coups. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=812.0s)]
*  Musk knows his place. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=813.0s)]
*  A source from the Trump team says Musk's power flows only from the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=815.0s)]
*  president-elect. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=819.0s)]
*  There are things Elon doesn't agree with us on that he ain't getting. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=821.0s)]
*  Trump's running the show. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=825.0s)]
*  And the world's richest man wants us to get out of debt. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=826.0s)]
*  They think that's a problem? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=830.0s)]
*  How about thank you, Mr. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=832.0s)]
*  Musk. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=834.0s)]
*  We could have used you $35 trillion ago. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=835.0s)]
*  Democrats just blew through 2 billion bucks and left their party out of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=838.0s)]
*  power and in debt. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=841.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is puppeteering Donald Trump right now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=843.0s)]
*  He bought that presidency. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=847.0s)]
*  You said that Elon bought the presidency, right? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=849.0s)]
*  Elon spent what? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=852.0s)]
*  How much did he spend on Trump's campaign? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=853.0s)]
*  Like a couple hundred million dollars? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=855.0s)]
*  No, 250 million dollars. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=857.0s)]
*  250 million dollars. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=860.0s)]
*  So how does that get you a presidency but the over a billion dollars that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=861.0s)]
*  the VP raised doesn't? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=867.0s)]
*  Good question. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=869.0s)]
*  Democrats just tried to buy the White House and lost. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=871.0s)]
*  Trump won with half as much money. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=874.0s)]
*  Remember, Trump's a billionaire too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=877.0s)]
*  He's not easy to bribe like Joe Biden, whose family got caught with their [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=879.0s)]
*  handout looking for diamonds in Porsche panoramas. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=883.0s)]
*  The media is not curious why Biden's AWOL, not at all, Trump's giving [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=886.0s)]
*  Congress a public spanking. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=891.0s)]
*  And no one's stopping it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=893.0s)]
*  The American people voted for a complete upheaval. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=895.0s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=898.0s)]
*  Democracy's messy. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=900.0s)]
*  So it gets a little messier. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=902.0s)]
*  It's going in the right direction. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=904.0s)]
*  That we know. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjTRKfFc7s&t=906.0s)]
