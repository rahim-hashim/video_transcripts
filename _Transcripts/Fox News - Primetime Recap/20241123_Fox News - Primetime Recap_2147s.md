# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 22, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY)
*  Fanatics won't learn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2.0s)]
*  All right, it's a Friday before Thanksgiving. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  So it's 2024. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=8.6s)]
*  So of course, we're looking forward to 2028. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=10.8s)]
*  All right, now bear with me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=14.8s)]
*  It's clear to us that a growing number of never Trumpers, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=16.92s)]
*  the anti-Trump media, neoliberals, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=20.12s)]
*  are trying to convince themselves, and you, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=22.52s)]
*  that Trump's victory wasn't as significant [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=25.72s)]
*  as conservatives would have you believe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=28.56s)]
*  If you look at the raw vote from 2020, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=31.36s)]
*  he's still off of what Biden got by a good long ways. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=34.6s)]
*  Donald Trump won the presidency with 49% of the vote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=39.68s)]
*  48% of the vote. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=43.84s)]
*  We lost with 47% of the vote. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=45.28s)]
*  Did he win an election? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=48.2s)]
*  Yes. Did he win a mandate? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=49.36s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=50.92s)]
*  The New York Times pinged out the same message today [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=52.28s)]
*  in a column by Peter Baker titled [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=55.08s)]
*  The Landslide That Wasn't. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=57.16s)]
*  Baker pointed out that Trump won [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  with one of the smallest margins of victory [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  in the popular vote since the 19th century, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  and that Trump world is selling the illusion of a landslide [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=65.28s)]
*  in order to ram through Trump's agenda. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=68.92s)]
*  Well, first, what incoming president doesn't use his victory [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=71.84s)]
*  as a reason to enact his policies? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=76.64s)]
*  Isn't that the entire point of running and winning? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=78.4s)]
*  Second, and the press knows this, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=80.8s)]
*  it's not just the number of votes that Trump received, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=83.24s)]
*  which is impressive, it's where he got them, from whom, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=86.44s)]
*  and what he had to overcome to get them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  He's expanded demographically the Republican coalition. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=94.88s)]
*  The coalition that elected Trump in this election, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  it is younger, it's more blue collar, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=101.96s)]
*  and it's more diverse than any Republican coalition, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=104.6s)]
*  really, in modern political history. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=107.6s)]
*  Yeah, modern political history. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=110.52s)]
*  And as independent journalist Glenn Greenwald noted on X, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=112.32s)]
*  Trump won a higher percentage of votes in New York City [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=115.28s)]
*  than any Republican candidate [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=119.92s)]
*  since George Herbert Walker Bush in 1988, 36 years ago. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=122.64s)]
*  Now, that is huge. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=126.88s)]
*  It turns out issues actually mattered to these Trump voters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=128.72s)]
*  And we all know the problems that New York is facing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=133.2s)]
*  because of Democrat policies. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=135.08s)]
*  You take a look at outside the battleground [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=137.48s)]
*  where Trump made some of his biggest gains. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=139.36s)]
*  They were in states like New Jersey, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=141.32s)]
*  in New York, in California, big blue states. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=142.76s)]
*  He didn't win any of them, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=145.16s)]
*  but he made big gains because of this kind of a shift. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=146.64s)]
*  Democrats can continue with their fantasy thinking, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=150.12s)]
*  minimizing the shift toward the GOP among Latinos [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=153.04s)]
*  and African Americans, among even young people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=156.84s)]
*  and urban voters, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=159.0s)]
*  but Democrats are just hurting their own party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=160.56s)]
*  And we can never forget that Trump did all of this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  while being outspent three or four to one, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=167.04s)]
*  and while he was being pummeled by venal, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=170.12s)]
*  agenda-driven journalists with the most defamatory slurs [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=173.04s)]
*  that were then amplified by other leftists [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=176.92s)]
*  who are rarely right, but never in doubt. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=179.64s)]
*  And perhaps most impressive was Trump's victory [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=183.2s)]
*  despite being relentlessly hounded by political hatchet men [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=185.28s)]
*  and women in our legal system. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=189.0s)]
*  More on the big news from Judge Mershon later in the show. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=191.04s)]
*  But again, the key here is why they're trying to ride [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=194.04s)]
*  the idea that, well, they didn't lose by that much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=198.12s)]
*  Because that narrative suggests [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=202.32s)]
*  that Democrats really don't believe [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=204.44s)]
*  they need to make big changes to their approach. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=206.72s)]
*  Certainly not to the issues that people care about most. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Why should they? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  The victory wasn't that big for the Republicans. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=213.28s)]
*  If they only lost because Biden dropped out late [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  or because Trump's appeal is sui generis [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  or because Harris wasn't a good communicator, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=223.28s)]
*  then what they face as a party is really, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=226.64s)]
*  if that's their thinking, just a personality [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=229.68s)]
*  or maybe a comms problem. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=232.72s)]
*  Well, the problem, of course, with that is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=235.68s)]
*  they were wrong on substance, wrong on the economy, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=237.96s)]
*  wrong on war, wrong on the culture, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  and wrong on the border. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=243.12s)]
*  And the results for innocent Americans [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=244.84s)]
*  have been heartbreaking. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=247.4s)]
*  Do you think that Lakin Riley's mother [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=249.56s)]
*  thinks Democrats just have a comms problem [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  given what happened to her daughter? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=254.28s)]
*  This is how a mother reacts when she learns [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=256.64s)]
*  that something horrible has happened [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=259.0s)]
*  to her beautiful daughter. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=261.92s)]
*  Okay, let's step over here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=264.32s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=266.24s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=271.4s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=272.98s)]
*  You have to answer what happened. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=274.48s)]
*  I'll hang it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=275.84s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=277.28s)]
*  I don't wanna tell you yesterday [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=281.24s)]
*  because I don't have names. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=283.88s)]
*  I don't know who anybody is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=285.08s)]
*  This is pretty serious. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=287.64s)]
*  This is one of the main reasons Trump won. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=294.24s)]
*  He felt their pain. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=297.8s)]
*  He felt their rage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=300.4s)]
*  Riley was murdered by an illegal alien, Jose Ibarra, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=302.4s)]
*  and the incoming borders are, he knows the anguish as well [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=306.04s)]
*  because he's seen this play out too many times, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=309.48s)]
*  courtesy of politicians who don't give a damn. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=312.24s)]
*  I've seen so much tragedy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=315.86s)]
*  I've talked to hundreds of angels and moms and dads [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=317.22s)]
*  who buried their children [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  because they were killed by illegal alien. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=321.54s)]
*  This is just the latest. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=323.38s)]
*  I've talked to little girls as young as nine years old [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=324.98s)]
*  that were raped multiple times by members of cartel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=327.82s)]
*  When you look in her eyes and everything innocent and pure [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=330.94s)]
*  has been ripped from her soul [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  and her life will never be the same. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's just, I'm tired of it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=337.42s)]
*  Now Democrats can't respond to this story [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=340.34s)]
*  or any others like it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=345.06s)]
*  because they've become so accustomed to standing up [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=347.06s)]
*  for the rights of the illegals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungeri, Rachel Moran, Lakin Riley, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=353.14s)]
*  they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  by some of the men who were released [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  at the beginning of the administration. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=362.14s)]
*  This is a specific policy decision by your administration [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=363.73999999999995s)]
*  to release these men into the country [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  so what I'm saying to you, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=369.18s)]
*  do you owe those families an apology? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=370.42s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=374.18s)]
*  But let's talk about what is happening right now [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=378.5s)]
*  with an individual who does not want to participate [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  in solutions. Let's talk about that as well. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=386.06s)]
*  Those are tragic cases, but there is no but. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=389.94s)]
*  And there's no apology forthcoming now, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=394.7s)]
*  not from her and not from the Democrat party. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=397.14s)]
*  Their so-called post-November 5th autopsy [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=401.34s)]
*  should include a close examination of the autopsy reports [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=405.02s)]
*  of the Americans savagely murdered by illegals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=409.46s)]
*  But instead, their sanctuary leaders [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=412.78s)]
*  will proudly protect the migrants. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=414.62s)]
*  That's not gonna happen on my watch. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=418.02s)]
*  We will not be participating in misguided efforts [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=419.86s)]
*  that harm our communities. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=423.46s)]
*  We're not gonna ask our police force to serve as ICE agents. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=424.98s)]
*  I'm not, we're not cooperating with that madness. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=429.42s)]
*  The city of Los Angeles will not participate [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  in any collaboration with ICE. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  And Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, is among the worst. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=436.98s)]
*  We do not need the federal government's help [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=441.38s)]
*  in stepping in to cause mass fear. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=443.26s)]
*  We have laws on the books that ensure [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=445.38s)]
*  that we do not cooperate on civil immigration detainers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=447.38s)]
*  Safer? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=451.98s)]
*  Now these rapist migrants terrorized children, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=453.3s)]
*  as you heard Holman say, destroyed their innocence, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  ripped it from them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  Look at them, Mayor Wu, read the police reports, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=461.54s)]
*  read the charging documents. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=464.74s)]
*  For open borders Democrats, this isn't about safety. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=468.14000000000004s)]
*  It's not about safety of the migrants, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  the migrants are being brutalized too. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=473.3s)]
*  It's not about the safety of the American people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=475.3s)]
*  It's about politics and their own fanaticism. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=477.66s)]
*  And even child rape, even a nursing student out for a run [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=481.98s)]
*  getting her head bashed in, it doesn't matter. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=485.94s)]
*  Even migrant gangs terrorizing formerly quiet neighborhoods, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  none of it matters. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=492.54s)]
*  Trump's approval rating is already at an all time high of 54%. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  And it's only gonna go higher if Democrats refuse to learn [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=499.86s)]
*  the real lessons of 2024. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=502.90000000000003s)]
*  Their policies were destroying America's economy, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=506.14000000000004s)]
*  our sovereignty and our peace of mind. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=510.06s)]
*  But if Democrats won't learn the obvious, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=513.4200000000001s)]
*  they're not only stupid, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=515.22s)]
*  oh, they're giving great news to the Republican party [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=517.1s)]
*  in 2026 and for JD Vance in 2028. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=519.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  Red alert, Democrats are sending out a holiday warning. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=525.46s)]
*  Don't go to Thanksgiving dinner this year. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=528.82s)]
*  Your conservative uncle might rat you out to the MAGA police. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  People are rightfully alarmed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=535.6600000000001s)]
*  They have a reason to be alarmed. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=537.0200000000001s)]
*  If this thing goes way south, autocracies go south real fast [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=538.22s)]
*  and things get ugly and people get asked to do things [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=543.22s)]
*  and turn people in and point people out and turn on them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=546.5s)]
*  If you think that you can vote for what people see [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  as their destruction and then demand [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=554.58s)]
*  that they still are cool with you and kiki with you [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=556.94s)]
*  and have Thanksgiving with you, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=559.58s)]
*  like I think you're kind of missing the point. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  Jerry, pass the stuffing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=565.7s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  What sign did you have on your lawn? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=568.58s)]
*  No one's getting turned in unless you're here illegally. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=571.1s)]
*  Trump said his revenge will be success, not liberal work camps. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=574.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump got some pretty bad news this week [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  and he didn't react like a dictator. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  The Senate wasn't gonna confirm Matt Gaetz. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=583.7800000000001s)]
*  So did Trump thrash about and dissolve the Senate? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=586.46s)]
*  No. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=589.38s)]
*  He respected the check and balance [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  and picked a new attorney general. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=591.9000000000001s)]
*  Not something Hitler would have done. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=595.5s)]
*  We don't have a king, we don't have an autocrat, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=597.74s)]
*  we don't have a dictatorship. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=600.14s)]
*  The framers were very clear that we have separate [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=602.0200000000001s)]
*  and co-equal branches of government, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  we've got checks and balances. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  The Senate, I think, held, it did its job [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=610.1s)]
*  in terms of advice and consent [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=613.38s)]
*  and that is a good thing for America [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  in terms of how we move forward. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=617.74s)]
*  Trump swapped out Gaetz with someone [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  who has a much better chance of getting confirmed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=620.94s)]
*  Former Florida AG, Pam Bondi. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=623.26s)]
*  JD Vance says attorney general's the most important job [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=625.66s)]
*  in the government, only behind the president. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=628.46s)]
*  Trump's had his eye on Bondi for a while. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=631.14s)]
*  I'd consider Pam Bondi for anything. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=634.7s)]
*  She's doing a very good job, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=636.74s)]
*  she's always done a very good job. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  But in some form, in some form, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=640.26s)]
*  I'd love to have her in the administration. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=642.06s)]
*  Just like with every nomination, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=645.7s)]
*  they're gonna try to dig up dirt on Bondi. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=647.42s)]
*  But all they've found so far is she's got a great resume. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=649.7s)]
*  One reaction I got from inside the Justice Department [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=653.3s)]
*  last night was this is Matt Gaetz [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=655.62s)]
*  with a better legal resume. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=657.66s)]
*  She will be every bit the loyalist [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=659.58s)]
*  that Matt Gaetz would have been, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=661.42s)]
*  just with a little more legal experience [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=663.26s)]
*  and a little less baggage, or so it seems. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=665.7s)]
*  Pam Bondi is, without a question, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=668.86s)]
*  qualified to be attorney general. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  That level of experience is on par with or better [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=672.38s)]
*  than most United States attorneys general [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=675.5s)]
*  that we've seen over the past 50 years or so. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=677.62s)]
*  You know Bondi's a winner [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=680.7s)]
*  because the deep state sounds awfully nervous. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=681.82s)]
*  Pam Bondi is one of those smart women. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=684.7s)]
*  Mark Cuban said Trump avoids. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=686.5400000000001s)]
*  Add her to the list. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=689.0200000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Stefanic, Suzy Wiles. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=690.46s)]
*  Cuban's eating his words. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=695.46s)]

*  from all of us here tonight. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=699.9000000000001s)]
*  Underestimate us. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=702.94s)]
*  This is gonna be fun. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=704.46s)]
*  They underestimated MAGA, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=705.94s)]
*  now it's time for a little fun. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=709.46s)]
*  The legal cases against Trump are withering away. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=711.34s)]
*  The sentencing for the porn star shakedown [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=714.06s)]
*  has been indefinitely delayed [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=716.18s)]
*  and the Fannie Willis trials on its last legs. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=718.38s)]
*  So the law fair's on ice [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=720.9s)]
*  and the attorney general confirmation's looking smooth. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=722.46s)]
*  Now Trump can focus on the rest of his administration. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=725.5s)]
*  President Trump just filled a position [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=728.7s)]
*  very close to his heart, Treasury. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=730.5s)]

*  Besant's openly gay. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=736.7s)]
*  I guess the gays aren't going to get no. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=739.34s)]
*  Next, Trump's gonna shake up the FBI and the Secret Service. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  Former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino's [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=745.54s)]
*  being considered for director. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=747.82s)]
*  Bongino's been very critical of the agency's top brass [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=749.7s)]
*  after Trump was almost assassinated twice over the summer. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=752.58s)]
*  If Bongino gets in there, I guarantee you [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=756.42s)]
*  he's gonna put an end to the cover-up [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=759.22s)]
*  and we'll finally find out what really happened [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=760.9s)]
*  in Butler and West Palm. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=763.18s)]
*  And former Congressman Mike Rogers's name [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=765.18s)]
*  was being tossed around for FBI director. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=767.86s)]
*  Not sure why. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=770.86s)]
*  And then this happened. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=772.62s)]
*  Mike Rogers is a totally reasonable, logical [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=774.78s)]
*  selection for FBI director. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=779.62s)]
*  If in fact that's the decision a president like Trump makes. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=781.54s)]
*  Andrew McCabe endorsing Rogers, that's the kiss of death. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=785.58s)]
*  Not long after that, Dan Scavino said this, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  just spoke to President Trump regarding Mike Rogers [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=791.94s)]
*  going to the FBI, it's not happening. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=794.46s)]
*  In his own words, I have never even given it a thought. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=796.7800000000001s)]
*  Not happening. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=800.1s)]
*  FBI director's a position Trump's thinking a lot about. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=801.74s)]
*  He needs to get this one right. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=804.5s)]
*  This is the same agency that wiretapped his campaign, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=806.5400000000001s)]
*  cooked up the Russia hooks, covered up the laptop [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=809.22s)]
*  and raided his house. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=811.82s)]
*  Its current director, Ray, said he wasn't sure [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=813.46s)]
*  if Trump actually got shot in Butler. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=816.7s)]
*  Ray still has time left on his term, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=819.46s)]
*  but he's either gotta resign or make Trump fire him. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=821.22s)]
*  It's his choice. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=824.38s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting that Trump's gonna fire [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=825.98s)]
*  Jack Smith's entire team. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=828.5400000000001s)]
*  They'll resign too if they had any dignity. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=830.5400000000001s)]
*  We need the FBI and the DOJ to stop criminals and terrorists [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=833.3000000000001s)]

*  It'd also be nice to tighten up [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=839.5s)]
*  some of the agency's spending. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=840.86s)]
*  You ready? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=843.0200000000001s)]
*  Whistleblower says the FBI blew your money [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  on stupid little office activities like a painting class [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=846.3000000000001s)]
*  where agents could get to know colleagues [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  and unleash their creativity. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=852.86s)]
*  Oh, and they also did office yoga. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=855.38s)]
*  Not sure why they just can't stretch on their free time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=858.06s)]
*  And there was lunch and coloring. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=860.86s)]
*  They described it as a fun series of coloring sessions [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=863.58s)]
*  during lunch that you will get to see [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=866.7s)]
*  your colleagues artistic sides. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=869.62s)]
*  Elon, we found some government waste there. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=872.5s)]
*  Trump's FBI director's gonna have their work cut out for him. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=875.06s)]
*  And so is every other person Trump picks. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=878.26s)]
*  Trump wants to radically transform the government. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=880.7s)]
*  It's what he campaigned on. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=882.98s)]
*  It's what Americans voted for. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=884.02s)]
*  In 2016, his agenda got swallowed up [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=885.9s)]
*  by DC bureaucrats and rabid Democrats. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=888.34s)]
*  But Politico reports all the forces that were coming for him [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  have been kind of defanged and obliterated. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=895.54s)]
*  This time, it feels like Trump found his footing in Washington [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=898.42s)]
*  and has his people around him. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  They believe in his plan. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=903.66s)]
*  Reporters who've been covering Trump for a decade [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=905.38s)]
*  say after two assassination attempts, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=907.9399999999999s)]
*  four indictments, and a landslide, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=909.78s)]
*  Trump has a, quote, different sort of confidence and nerve. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=911.78s)]
*  Trump's carrying the momentum from the election [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=915.9s)]
*  all the way to the inauguration. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=918.38s)]
*  Then it's time for him to execute his vision without delay. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=920.38s)]
*  All right, please make sure to keep the deep state [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=924.38s)]
*  in your thoughts tonight. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=927.9s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden's State Department, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=929.42s)]
*  reportedly they had a therapy session. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=931.02s)]
*  Why? To help government workers cope with the election results [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=933.9s)]
*  and Donald Trump's big win. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=938.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure emotions are running very high. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=940.62s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to bring in comfort animals any day now. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=943.5s)]
*  But tonight, we end the week with more good news for Donald Trump. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=946.7s)]
*  The lawfare against the president-elect in New York [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=949.82s)]
*  has officially fallen apart. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=952.7800000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, Judge Juan Mershon canceled [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=954.7800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's sentencing, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=957.62s)]
*  granted his request to proceed with a motion [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=959.1s)]
*  to dismiss all charges, which they should have done, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=961.5400000000001s)]
*  and they never should have been brought in the first place. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=964.5400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, while Trump appears to be in the clear, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=967.0200000000001s)]
*  you just never know, though, with this judge and DA Bragg. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=969.78s)]
*  You don't know. Now, coming up, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=973.74s)]
*  we're going to show you how New York's politicized [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=975.3s)]
*  and weaponized system of justice is putting everybody in danger. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=978.26s)]
*  But we begin with something very interesting [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=982.6999999999999s)]
*  you might not have noticed after the election. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=985.3399999999999s)]
*  All across the country, there were many devout Democrats [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=987.78s)]
*  who were not just angry that Donald Trump won, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=991.26s)]
*  they were also in a complete state of shock. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=993.38s)]
*  Many totally, completely blindsided [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=996.8199999999999s)]
*  by Donald Trump's resounding win [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=999.98s)]
*  in both the Electoral College and the popular vote. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1002.14s)]
*  Now, despite the disastrous last four years, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1004.8199999999999s)]
*  the terrible approval numbers of Kamala and Joe, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1008.14s)]
*  a wave of polls we had pollsters on regularly [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1011.98s)]
*  in favor of Donald Trump, the Democrats, what? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1016.5s)]
*  They didn't see it coming? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1019.5s)]
*  The legacy media didn't see it coming? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1020.78s)]
*  Probably because the primary source of news is legacy media, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1023.2199999999999s)]
*  where, look, I said in 2007, journalism in America is dead. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1028.06s)]
*  It's been dead and buried, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1033.1799999999998s)]
*  with a few exceptions like Fox News for some time, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1034.58s)]
*  and it's become a far-left echo chamber. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1037.58s)]
*  That is what has emerged, political hacks at the AP, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1040.7s)]
*  Reuters, nearly every single major newspaper, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1044.58s)]
*  New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times, USA Today, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1047.62s)]
*  the other two cable news outlets [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1051.34s)]
*  all repeat the same Democratic talking points [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1053.22s)]
*  day in and day out. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1055.78s)]
*  Most Americans, including most of you watching tonight, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1056.94s)]
*  you have known this for years, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1060.34s)]
*  and most Americans now have tuned out the noise. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1062.58s)]
*  Now people have choices. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1066.3s)]
*  First, they had talk radio, Fox News. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1067.9s)]
*  Now they have social media. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1070.5s)]
*  Then they have podcasting. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1072.3s)]
*  They are very selective [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  in where they're getting their information. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1075.3s)]
*  Democrats, they just have their heads in the sand. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1077.34s)]
*  Legacy media is refusing to change course, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1080.06s)]
*  even as their numbers decline, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1083.42s)]
*  their influence is totally evaporated. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1085.3s)]
*  Now take a look at this headline published just yesterday, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1087.86s)]
*  this on MSDNC, quote, this makes me so angry. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1091.1s)]

*  Lakin Riley's killer never stood a chance. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1098.42s)]
*  The guy was caught red-handed, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1103.5s)]
*  a young nursing student with a whole life ahead of her, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  and he was out stalking, looking for somebody to rape. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1109.7s)]

*  Oh. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1968.06s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1968.9s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1969.74s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1970.58s)]
*  But. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1971.42s)]
*  But. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1972.26s)]
*  But. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1973.06s)]
*  But. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1973.9s)]
*  Everybody's scared. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1974.74s)]
*  They're scared. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1975.78s)]
*  They're scared. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1976.6200000000001s)]
*  She made sure everybody knew that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1977.46s)]
*  Yeah, people were frightened. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1978.94s)]
*  But who made them so scared? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1980.5s)]
*  You, you dip. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1982.78s)]
*  You convinced, you convinced your audience [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1984.14s)]
*  that Trump wanted to destroy democracy and kill women. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1987.1000000000001s)]
*  Even Randy Weingarten is hysterical [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1990.6200000000001s)]
*  and he's no shrinking violet. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1993.02s)]
*  You know, if you really believed the stuff [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=1995.46s)]
*  you actually said, you'd be fleeing the country, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2003.06s)]
*  not groveling at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2005.38s)]
*  Fact is your viewers revile you [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2007.74s)]
*  because your motivations were exposed. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2010.1000000000001s)]
*  The fear mongering was strictly business. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2012.74s)]
*  And now that your job is in jeopardy, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2015.38s)]
*  the fear mongering has gone away. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2017.14s)]
*  You went from telling them Trump was evil [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2019.06s)]
*  to Trump's not so bad. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2020.9s)]
*  It's like your spouse telling you [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2022.82s)]
*  how much she hates her boss [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2024.26s)]
*  before running off with him to Jamaica. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2025.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, Rachel Maddow's salary [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2031.42s)]
*  has been slashed by $5 million a year. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2033.18s)]
*  It sounds like a lot, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2037.26s)]
*  except she was making 30 million a year [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2038.54s)]
*  for one show a week. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2042.86s)]
*  So if she does 50 shows a year, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2046.3s)]
*  her pay went from 600,000 an episode to 500,000. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2049.06s)]
*  That's like five bucks per viewer. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2055.1000000000004s)]
*  But one MSNBC executive justifies it [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2060.1000000000004s)]
*  calling Maddow quote, ratings viagra. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2064.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry, she couldn't even give Chris Matthews a semi. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2068.5800000000004s)]
*  And he's a horny little devil. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2073.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2079.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2082.9s)]
*  So what's next for MSNBC? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2084.06s)]
*  Well, they're gonna try to redefine themselves [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2086.34s)]
*  as a startup, but that's impossible [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2088.42s)]
*  because the product is nothing new [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2091.06s)]
*  and it's hopelessly contaminated. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2092.7799999999997s)]
*  It's radioactive. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2094.74s)]
*  It's like closing Chernobyl, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2096.2999999999997s)]
*  throwing on a coat of paint, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2098.1s)]
*  and reopening it as a glow in the dark cracker barrel. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2099.54s)]
*  Oh, be sure and check out the petting zoo [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2104.02s)]
*  for animals with eight legs. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2105.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2107.66s)]
*  But they're hoping that their viewers [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2112.02s)]
*  are so addicted to lies that they'll come back. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2113.42s)]
*  Please come back, MSNBC will say to their betrayed lovers. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2116.94s)]
*  I'll promise I'll do better. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2120.34s)]
*  You need me. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2121.9s)]
*  And they probably will go back. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2123.66s)]
*  There's always a market for terrible ideas. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2125.02s)]
*  Even when the mocha smoothie they're being served [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2127.86s)]
*  is actually full of. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV96FdYQvlY&t=2130.42s)]
