# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 16, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78)
*  Attack of the five foot four inch woman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2.04s)]
*  He has talked about turning the American military [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=5.68s)]
*  on the American people. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  He has talked about going after people [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=9.24s)]
*  who are engaged in peaceful protest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=11.88s)]
*  He has talked about locking people up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=14.0s)]
*  because they disagree with him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=16.72s)]
*  This is a democracy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=18.6s)]
*  And in a democracy, the president of the United States [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=20.48s)]
*  in the United States of America should be willing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  to be able to handle criticism [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=28.16s)]
*  without saying he'd lock people up for doing it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=30.64s)]
*  Well, she was raging in that interview [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=34.4s)]
*  at the top with Bret Baer. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=36.28s)]
*  Well, I think she probably sees what all of us see, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=38.4s)]
*  that beating Trump is a lot harder than they thought. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=42.04s)]
*  And they're beginning to lose ground in key places. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=44.84s)]
*  So now they're going back to what didn't work [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  every other time they tried it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Obsessing over Trump's language in the hyperbole [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=52.28s)]
*  over the last 24 hours, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=56.4s)]
*  as tired as the dinosaurs spewing it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=58.32s)]
*  Putin is the 20th century's Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=61.4s)]
*  What's Putin trying to do? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=67.44s)]
*  He's trying to play Donald Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=69.4s)]
*  So I think we are in such a dangerous position [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=72.68s)]
*  that Trump might become president again. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=78.64s)]
*  President again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=82.68s)]
*  Going back to the Russia collusion nonsense. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=84.72s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's easier than grappling [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=87.44s)]
*  with one incontrovertible fact. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=90.48s)]
*  Bob, Putin didn't dare invade Ukraine [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=94.52s)]
*  when Trump was president. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=97.6s)]
*  But look, this final inning smearing of Trump [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=99.56s)]
*  is just more the same. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=101.8s)]
*  This feels like what you read in history [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  are the last days of a dictatorship. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=106.92s)]
*  To me, this would be like if there was an iPhone [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=109.24s)]
*  in the bunker in 1945, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=111.12s)]
*  this is the kind of things you would hear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=113.08s)]
*  The stuff he's saying on stage in the course of this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=114.96s)]
*  And it's, you know, obviously it's incredibly dangerous. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=117.72s)]
*  Okay, they're back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=121.24s)]
*  Now they're in Hitler's bunker. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=122.08s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=123.6s)]
*  Trump's tough talk is dangerous to these people? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Now what about the 10 million migrants, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=128.28s)]
*  including violent criminals, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=131.24s)]
*  that Biden and Harris let waltz right into America? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=132.52s)]
*  Is that incredibly dangerous? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=134.68s)]
*  Nah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=137.28s)]
*  Now when they say dangerous, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=138.52s)]
*  let me tell you what they really mean. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=139.68s)]
*  They mean that another Trump presidency [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=141.36s)]
*  will be dangerous to their grip on influence and power. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  And even casual political observers [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=150.08s)]
*  notice the obvious message coordination happening here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=152.28s)]
*  From the New York Times claiming that Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  is escalating threats [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=159.12s)]
*  and offering a far less democratic form of government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=164.4s)]
*  Of course, Kamala's ever trusty friends at Axios, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  they add onto the pig pile, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  revealing the blueprint for Kamala Harris's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=170.56s)]
*  campaign's closing argument. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=173.52s)]
*  In a nutshell, let me tell you what it is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=175.88s)]
*  Joy and love didn't do the trick. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=178.32s)]
*  No one brought her freedom and change narrative. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=180.88s)]
*  They weren't buying that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  And now her brat summer is just a fear-mongering fall. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=184.8s)]
*  Axios says that she's countered Trump's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=189.52s)]
*  increasingly dark grievance-filled rhetoric [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=191.72s)]
*  with warnings of what could happen if he's elected. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=193.96s)]
*  A move that some former Biden aides say [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=197.36s)]
*  sounds like their own strategy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=199.28s)]
*  Yeah, because it's all been done before [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=201.48s)]
*  by Biden and it didn't work. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=202.92s)]
*  Well, look, it's not the first time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=205.12s)]
*  that she's been accused of copying others' work [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=206.44s)]
*  without attribution, is it? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=208.72s)]
*  She even went on a tirade today [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=211.0s)]
*  trying to play to the squad and people like Rachel Maddow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=212.52s)]
*  You know, the woman whose party tried to put Donald Trump [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=216.48s)]
*  in jail is now claiming in lie after lie [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=219.24s)]
*  that he is the anti-democratic force to fear. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=223.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=227.4s)]
*  He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=234.08s)]
*  and he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=238.72s)]
*  He considers any American who doesn't support him [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=244.52s)]
*  to be an enemy to our country. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=250.28s)]
*  And further, he says that as commander in chief, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=252.96s)]
*  he would use our military to go after them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=256.92s)]
*  Lie, lie, lie, lie. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=262.44s)]
*  Go peacefully to do your march to the Capitol. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=264.48s)]
*  Isn't that what he said? Something like that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=269.16s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=270.76s)]
*  Now, seriously, of course, reverting to Biden's old strategy, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=271.76s)]
*  which is Charlottesville, January 6, an enemies list, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=274.6s)]
*  Hitler, Putin, the end of the Constitution. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=277.4s)]
*  I mean, I gotta say, what else do they have? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=279.84s)]
*  They have to go back to it because they sure as heck [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  don't want to talk about the massive layoffs [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  happening across America. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=287.44s)]
*  And yet none of the anti-Trump smears, I think, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=289.44s)]
*  are going to change the public views on any of this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  The issue that matters most in this country is the economy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=295.44s)]
*  But again, Kamala's team thinks that scaring voters [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=301.23999999999995s)]
*  about Trump is the only card they have to play. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=303.55999999999995s)]
*  Yet how can it possibly make Americans vote [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=307.04s)]
*  against their own pocketbooks, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=310.04s)]
*  which they'll obviously be doing if they vote for her? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, the polling is consistently terrible for Harris, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=315.64000000000004s)]
*  saying that 59% say the economy is getting worse. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=318.24s)]
*  More than twice as many say it's getting better [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=322.24s)]
*  than they say it's getting better. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=325.24s)]
*  Only 23% say it's getting better. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=327.04s)]
*  And among registered voters who say the economy is worsening, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=329.24s)]
*  Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 50%. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=332.04s)]
*  Harris by a sweeping 53 points. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=335.64s)]
*  So the spinmeisters and the messaging gurus in Kamala's camp [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=340.44s)]
*  are trying to bluff Americans. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  They have a bad card and they're playing a losing hand [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=347.44s)]
*  with a losing argument made by a woman [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=351.44s)]
*  who's never won a national primary, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=354.44s)]
*  a woman who warns about Trump's rhetoric [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  while they casually spew the worst insults at Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=359.84s)]
*  I don't even think she really believes [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=364.84s)]
*  what she's saying, none of them do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  They never really have. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=369.14s)]
*  It's all just a talking point in the absence [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=371.14s)]
*  of a real record to run on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  All right, coming up, Kamala's campaign [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=377.64s)]
*  plagued by incompetence in a key swing state [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=379.44s)]
*  will bring you all the details next. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=383.64s)]
*  Covering the Kamala campaign's been disorienting. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=385.84s)]
*  First, she was the most unpopular VP in history. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Then she's Mrs. Messiah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Her record's radical left. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=394.24s)]
*  Then she agrees with Trump, but her values haven't changed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=396.44s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=400.44s)]
*  Her VP's wooing white dudes [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=401.64s)]
*  and Obama's scolding the brothers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=403.44s)]
*  She hid from CNN for five weeks. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=406.04s)]
*  Then she turned down the Fox debate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=408.54s)]
*  Now she's playing footsie with Rogan [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=410.64s)]
*  and begging to come on Fox. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=412.64s)]
*  Well, be careful what you wish for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=415.04s)]
*  because Kamala Harris just sat down with Bret Baer [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=417.64s)]
*  for a half hour and she was roughed up so badly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=420.04s)]
*  Pelosi's asking Joe to get back in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=423.24s)]
*  How many illegal immigrants would you estimate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=426.44s)]
*  your administration has released into the country [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=430.24s)]
*  over the last three and a half years? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=433.44s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=435.54s)]
*  because I agree with you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=437.44s)]
*  It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=438.44s)]
*  And you know what I'm gonna talk about. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=443.64s)]
*  Yeah, but just a number. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=446.04s)]
*  Do you think it's one million, three million? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=447.24s)]
*  Bret, let's just get to the point, okay? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=449.44s)]
*  The point is that we have a broken immigration system [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=451.84s)]
*  that needs to be repaired. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  So your Homeland Security Secretary [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  said that 85% of apprehensions... [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=459.14s)]
*  I'm not finished. I'm not finished. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  We have an immigration system... [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  It's a rough estimate of six million people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=463.23999999999995s)]
*  that have been released into the country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=465.23999999999995s)]
*  And let me just finish. I'll get to the question. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  I was beginning to answer. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=469.64s)]
*  And when you came into office, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=470.84s)]
*  your administration immediately reversed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=472.84s)]
*  a number of Trump border policies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=474.44s)]
*  So looking back, do you regret the decision [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=476.84s)]
*  to terminate Remain in Mexico [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=480.54s)]
*  at the beginning of your administration? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  The first bill, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=485.04s)]
*  practically within hours of taking the oath, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=486.94s)]
*  was a bill to fix our immigration system. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=489.94s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. It was called the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=492.14000000000004s)]
*  It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the... [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=497.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  May I finish responding, please? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=501.24s)]
*  But you have to let me finish, please. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=503.04s)]
*  You had the White House and the House and the Senate, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  and they didn't bring up that bill. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=506.74s)]
*  I'm responding to the point you're raising. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=508.14s)]
*  And I'd like to finish. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=511.74s)]
*  We recognized from day one [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=514.14s)]
*  that to the point of this being your first question, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=517.34s)]
*  it is a priority for us as a nation [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=520.24s)]
*  and for the American people. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=523.54s)]
*  And our focus has been on fixing a problem. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=525.74s)]
*  This was the first time the vice president [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=529.34s)]
*  and the Democrat nominee had ever had to answer for herself. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=532.14s)]
*  She spent more time defending herself with Brett [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=536.44s)]
*  than she has defending the actual border. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=538.84s)]
*  Then it got personal. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  Former President Clinton actually referred to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=543.74s)]
*  Lake and Riley Sunday, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=545.24s)]
*  campaigning for you in Georgia, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=546.34s)]
*  saying if those men had been properly vetted, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=547.6400000000001s)]
*  Lake and Riley probably would not have been killed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=549.94s)]
*  So if it wouldn't have happened, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=552.6400000000001s)]
*  this is well before any negotiation. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=554.84s)]
*  This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=557.5400000000001s)]
*  This is a specific policy decision by your administration [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=560.0400000000001s)]
*  to release these men into the country. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=563.74s)]
*  So what I'm saying to you, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=565.54s)]
*  do you owe those families an apology? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=566.8399999999999s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=570.54s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=574.74s)]
*  There is no question about that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  And I can't imagine the pain [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=579.54s)]
*  that the families of those victims have experienced [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=582.3399999999999s)]
*  for a loss that should not have occurred. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=586.74s)]
*  So that is true. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=590.04s)]
*  It is also true that if a border security [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=593.34s)]
*  had actually been passed nine months ago, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=596.64s)]
*  it would be nine months that we would have had [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=599.14s)]
*  more border agents at the border, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=602.84s)]
*  more support for the folks who are working around the clock, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=604.84s)]
*  trying to hold it all together. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=608.74s)]
*  Brett Baer is giving Kamala an opportunity [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=610.84s)]
*  to say if she were president, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=613.44s)]
*  Lake and Riley would have been alive. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  Kamala should have said, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=617.94s)]
*  that's something I would have done differently than Biden. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=618.94s)]
*  I would have secured the border much earlier, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=621.94s)]
*  but I was just the VP [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=624.34s)]
*  serving at the pleasure of the president. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=625.5400000000001s)]
*  And if you vote for me, I promise I'll protect women [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=627.44s)]
*  like Lake and Riley. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=629.5400000000001s)]
*  At this stage of the campaign, saying, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=631.84s)]
*  I'm sorry about the dead woman on my watch, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=634.34s)]
*  it's all Trump's fault, it's not gonna fly. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=636.5400000000001s)]
*  Harris has never been pressed this hard [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=639.74s)]
*  on her border policies. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=641.74s)]
*  And it continued. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=643.84s)]
*  Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=645.94s)]
*  in the early part of your administration. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=648.44s)]
*  I will let one of the mothers talk about it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=650.14s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=652.84s)]
*  Because of the Biden-Harris administration [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=654.64s)]
*  open border policies catch and release, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  they were enrolled in the alternatives [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=660.04s)]
*  to detention program. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=662.04s)]
*  This meant that they were released into the United States. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=663.54s)]
*  It was not even a full three weeks later [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=666.54s)]
*  that they would take my daughter Jocelyn Nungare's life. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=668.64s)]
*  I believe the Biden-Harris administration [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  open border policies are responsible [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=674.04s)]
*  for the death of my daughter. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=676.04s)]
*  That's the early days. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=678.34s)]
*  So do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=680.44s)]
*  I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=683.14s)]
*  I'm so sorry for her loss. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=686.74s)]
*  Sincerely. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=688.74s)]
*  But let's talk about what is happening right now [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=691.14s)]
*  with an individual who does not want [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=695.14s)]
*  to participate in solutions. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=698.04s)]
*  Let's talk about that as well. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=700.14s)]
*  But do you want to answer that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=702.24s)]
*  In all fairness, I told you, I feel awful [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=703.14s)]
*  for what she and her family have experienced. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=706.74s)]
*  During that time, you said repeatedly [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=708.84s)]
*  that the border was secure. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=710.84s)]
*  When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=712.74s)]
*  I think we've had a broken immigration system [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=716.34s)]
*  transcending by the way [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=718.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration even before. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=719.84s)]
*  Let's all be honest about that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=722.64s)]
*  I have no pride in saying [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=724.74s)]
*  that this is a perfect immigration system. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=727.24s)]
*  I've been clear, I think we all are, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=729.14s)]
*  that it needs to be fixed. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=732.04s)]
*  Kamala just said the border has always been broken, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=733.94s)]
*  but it was secure for three years [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=736.94s)]
*  when Lake and Riley was murdered. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=741.44s)]
*  How did Trump break the border that you said was secure? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  You can't follow Kamala's logic because there is none. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=747.24s)]
*  She doesn't know anything about the border. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=750.44s)]
*  She doesn't care about the border. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=752.0400000000001s)]
*  She just doesn't want anyone talking about it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=753.44s)]
*  Her whole interview was a continuation of a cover-up. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=759.24s)]
*  Madam Vice President, you called Donald Trump. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=760.24s)]
*  What's the significance of that? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=762.64s)]
*  You called Donald Trump, he's misguided. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=764.14s)]
*  You say now he is unstable. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=767.64s)]
*  He is unstable, but. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  He's not well. You say he's mentally not stable. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=771.14s)]
*  He's not stable. Let me ask you this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=774.04s)]
*  You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=775.64s)]
*  that ran around circles on his staff. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=779.54s)]
*  When did you first notice [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=781.9399999999999s)]
*  that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=783.34s)]
*  Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=786.34s)]
*  to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=793.34s)]
*  and the experience to do exactly what he has done [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=797.5400000000001s)]
*  in making very important decisions [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=801.64s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=803.94s)]
*  There were no concerns raised? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=805.44s)]
*  Joe Biden is not on the ballot. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=807.14s)]
*  I understand. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=808.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is. But you talked about it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump is. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=811.84s)]
*  After George Clooney said within a few minutes [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=812.84s)]
*  of talking to President Biden at a fundraiser [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=814.74s)]
*  that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=816.74s)]
*  that we saw on the debate stage. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=819.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is on the ballot. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=821.24s)]
*  I understand. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=822.44s)]
*  You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=823.84s)]
*  You didn't have any concerns? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=826.94s)]
*  I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=830.14s)]
*  So Kamala Harris didn't want to talk about Kamala Harris, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=833.44s)]
*  and she definitely didn't want to talk about Joe Biden. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=836.74s)]
*  She never once touted the accomplishments [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=839.84s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=841.94s)]
*  Not a single one. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=843.34s)]
*  She just wants to prosecute Donald Trump. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=845.34s)]
*  But America doesn't want to prosecute her. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=847.74s)]
*  We want a president. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=849.5400000000001s)]
*  At one point, she just snapped. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=851.1400000000001s)]
*  This is a democracy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=853.84s)]
*  And in a democracy, the president of the United States, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=859.74s)]
*  should be willing to be able to handle criticism [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=861.94s)]
*  without saying he'd lock people up for doing it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=865.94s)]
*  And this is what is at stake, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=869.44s)]
*  which is why you have someone like the former chairman [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=871.34s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=874.0400000000001s)]
*  about Donald Trump being a threat [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=879.0400000000001s)]
*  to the United States of America. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=882.14s)]
*  Why didn't we see anger like that about the border? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=884.44s)]
*  About prices? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=887.34s)]
*  About crime? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=888.94s)]
*  Never kind of showed that flash of anger [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=889.74s)]
*  when it was affecting millions of Americans? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=891.94s)]
*  She wasn't likable. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=895.14s)]
*  She wasn't charming. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=896.24s)]
*  She was never funny. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=897.34s)]
*  She wasn't warm. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=899.24s)]
*  There was nothing gracious. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=900.24s)]
*  She wasn't eloquent or reassuring about this performance. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=901.24s)]
*  Then Brett asked her the question that she's had a week, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=904.94s)]
*  actually the whole campaign to think about. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=907.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=909.54s)]
*  So you're not Joe Biden, you're not Donald Trump, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=910.84s)]
*  but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=913.54s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=916.34s)]
*  My presidency will not be a continuation [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=917.84s)]
*  of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=920.24s)]
*  And like every new president that comes into office, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=922.24s)]
*  I will bring my life experiences, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=926.14s)]
*  my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=929.34s)]
*  I represent a new generation of leadership. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=932.14s)]
*  I, for example, am someone who has not spent [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=934.74s)]
*  the majority of my career in Washington, D.C. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=938.74s)]
*  She spent eight years in Washington, D.C. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=941.64s)]
*  That's twice as long as Trump. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=944.14s)]
*  And what would you do differently? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=946.64s)]
*  She said she'd bring fresh new ideas. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=948.54s)]
*  Then she never said what the ideas were. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=951.44s)]
*  Your campaign slogan is a new way forward [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=954.84s)]
*  and it's time to turn the page. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=957.14s)]
*  You've been vice president for three and a half years. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=959.14s)]
*  So what are you turning the page from? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=961.54s)]
*  Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=965.04s)]
*  in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=969.74s)]
*  coming from Donald Trump that has been designed [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  and implemented to divide our country [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=976.64s)]
*  and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  Madam Vice President, more than 70% of people [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=983.04s)]
*  tell pollsters... That is about turning the page [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=986.14s)]
*  on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Brett. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=987.64s)]
*  If you're turning the page, you've been in office [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  for three and a half years. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=993.54s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  But you've been the person holding the office. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=999.04s)]
*  Come on. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1000.64s)]
*  Madam Vice President. You and I both know [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1001.54s)]
*  what I'm talking about. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1002.54s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1003.64s)]
*  I actually don't. What are you talking about? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1006.34s)]
*  people have become... But you're the lever of power. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1010.74s)]
*  But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1012.14s)]
*  and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  the former chief of staff to the president, Donald Trump, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1020.5400000000001s)]
*  former defense secretaries, national security advisor, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1025.54s)]
*  and his vice president, one that he is unfit to serve, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1028.94s)]
*  that he is unstable, that he is dangerous. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1032.54s)]
*  So turning the page isn't turning the page from Biden. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1036.24s)]
*  She's going to do everything the same. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1039.04s)]
*  She's just turning the page from Trump, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1041.14s)]
*  who wasn't in office. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1044.24s)]
*  Her slogans don't even make sense [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1046.04s)]
*  because 79% of the country wants to turn the page from her. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  This is what an actual Kamala Harris interview [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1053.24s)]
*  should look like. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1056.24s)]
*  Brett gave her the same treatment [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1057.84s)]
*  as he gave Trump in the spring. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1059.54s)]
*  Respectful, firm, and persistent. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1061.24s)]
*  We didn't swap her answers to make her look better like CBS. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  We didn't invite little Timmy along to hold her hand like CNN. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1068.84s)]
*  This was a big-girl interview. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1072.24s)]
*  And she flopped. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  And Hannity and, well, desperate times. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1075.64s)]
*  They call for desperate measures at the Harris campaign. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1077.74s)]
*  Only hours ago, Kamala Harris sat down [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1080.64s)]
*  for a very tough, live-to-tape interview right here on the Fox [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  News channel with our very own Brett Baer. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1086.8400000000001s)]
*  Coming up, Brett Baer will join us [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1088.8400000000001s)]
*  with an exclusive recap of that interview. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1090.64s)]
*  Now, unlike the pro-Kamala, state-run fake news media [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1093.3400000000001s)]
*  and other people that call themselves journalists, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1097.94s)]
*  he asked tough, fair questions. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1100.64s)]
*  He insisted on real answers. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1103.5400000000002s)]
*  In a short period of time, a short window [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1105.34s)]
*  that they gave him about very important topics, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1107.24s)]
*  he didn't let Kamala off the hook. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1110.54s)]
*  He pressed her. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1112.24s)]
*  He pressed her repeatedly. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1113.04s)]
*  Needless to say, I'd say the joy is gone in the Harris campaign [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  tonight. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  And her obvious anger, that was on full display. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1119.4399999999998s)]
*  The one she's notorious for. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1122.24s)]
*  That was on full display during the interview. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1124.1399999999999s)]
*  Kamala appeared agitated, obsessively [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1126.34s)]
*  tried to simply avoid answering basic, fundamental questions. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1129.1399999999999s)]
*  She took zero responsibility for anything that has happened [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1133.54s)]
*  during the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1137.24s)]
*  And when all else would fail, she'd either flat out lie [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1139.3400000000001s)]
*  or go to the default campaign mode. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1142.64s)]
*  If the dog bites, if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1145.64s)]
*  just blame Donald Trump for everything. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1148.74s)]
*  Even the border crisis that she and Joe Biden caused. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1151.3400000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1154.94s)]
*  How many illegal immigrants would you estimate? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1156.24s)]
*  Your administration has released into the country [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1160.04s)]
*  over the last three and a half years. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1163.24s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1165.34s)]
*  because I agree with you. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1167.34s)]
*  It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1168.24s)]
*  And you know what I'm going to talk about. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1173.54s)]
*  Yeah, but do you just a number. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1175.74s)]
*  Do you think it's one million, three million? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1177.04s)]
*  Brett, let's just get to the point. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1179.34s)]
*  OK, the point is that we have a broken immigration system. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1181.34s)]
*  When you came into office, your administration immediately [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1185.54s)]
*  reversed a number of Trump border policies. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1187.84s)]
*  Most significantly, the policy that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1190.9399999999998s)]
*  required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1192.54s)]
*  either in the US or in Mexico. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  And you switched that policy. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1199.4399999999998s)]
*  They were released from custody awaiting trial. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1200.84s)]
*  So instead, included in those were a large number [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1203.9399999999998s)]
*  of single men, adult men, who went on to commit heinous crimes. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1207.4399999999998s)]
*  So looking back, do you regret the decision [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1211.9399999999998s)]
*  to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1215.54s)]
*  of your administration? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  At the beginning of our administration, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1220.04s)]
*  within practically hours of taking the oath, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1222.14s)]
*  the first bill that we offered Congress, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1227.04s)]
*  before we worked on infrastructure, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1230.14s)]
*  before the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1233.54s)]
*  before the Chips and Science Act, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1236.3400000000001s)]
*  before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1238.74s)]
*  the first bill practically within hours of taking the oath [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1243.04s)]
*  was a bill to fix our immigration system. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1247.94s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1250.14s)]
*  It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1250.54s)]
*  Well, here's the truth. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1256.3400000000001s)]
*  And let us not have revisionist history, shall we? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1257.74s)]
*  Because on day one, simply with the stroke of a pen, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1261.54s)]
*  not an act of Congress, the Harris-Biden White House, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1264.44s)]
*  they reversed all of Donald Trump's border protections [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1267.74s)]
*  with executive orders. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1271.74s)]
*  And then they bragged about it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  And they lied about the border being secure for three years. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1275.04s)]
*  But take a look at this. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1277.54s)]
*  So we have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1278.94s)]
*  it would take so much time to list them. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1284.94s)]
*  We rescinded the Remain in Mexico policy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1287.34s)]
*  We rescinded, of course, the public charge rule [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1291.54s)]
*  that deprived vulnerable migrants [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1295.04s)]
*  from accessing certain critical life benefits. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1298.54s)]
*  We have restored the Deferred Action [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1305.84s)]
*  We have rescinded so many and have restored so many [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1309.24s)]
*  that he really dismantled. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1314.84s)]
*  That's what they did on day one. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1318.9399999999998s)]
*  And she didn't answer Brett Baer's question [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1320.54s)]
*  on how many illegal immigrants unvetted [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1322.74s)]
*  did they allow into the country. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1325.34s)]
*  Well, the answer is over 12 million unvetted. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1326.9399999999998s)]
*  Harris-Biden illegal immigrants allowed inside of our country, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1330.24s)]
*  all with the stroke of a pen. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1334.4399999999998s)]
*  Many were violent criminals who committed heinous acts, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1335.84s)]
*  as Brett pointed out, against American citizens. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1338.74s)]
*  Dozens of Americans dead. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1341.74s)]
*  Dozens have been raped, including children. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1343.54s)]
*  Hundreds of others victims of violent crime. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1345.9399999999998s)]
*  The cost through the roof. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  Three young women that were mentioned during the interview. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1349.54s)]
*  Rachel Nungary, Lakin Riley, Rachel Moran, mother of five, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1353.04s)]
*  allegedly murdered by these suspected illegal aliens. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1357.54s)]
*  Others, again, murdered, raped, victims of violent crime [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  because of their failure to secure the border. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1363.64s)]
*  And of course, they rescinded every Trump policy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1367.0400000000002s)]
*  But don't expect an apology to the families of these victims [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1370.8400000000001s)]
*  from Kamala Harris. Take a look. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1374.44s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungary, Rachel Moran, Lakin Riley, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1376.64s)]
*  they are young women who were brutally assaulted [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1380.64s)]
*  and killed by some of the men who were released [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1383.44s)]
*  at the beginning of the administration, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1385.64s)]
*  well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1387.3400000000001s)]
*  This is a specific policy decision by your administration [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1391.14s)]
*  to release these men into the country. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1394.8400000000001s)]
*  So what I'm saying to you, do you owe those families an apology? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1396.5400000000002s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1401.5400000000002s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1408.3400000000001s)]
*  And I can't imagine the pain that the families [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1410.5400000000002s)]
*  of those victims have experienced. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1414.44s)]
*  For a loss that should not have occurred. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1417.8400000000001s)]
*  So that is true. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1421.04s)]
*  It is also true that if a border security [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1424.34s)]
*  had actually been passed nine months ago, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  it would be nine months that we would have had [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1430.1399999999999s)]
*  more border agents at the border. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1433.84s)]
*  So do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1435.94s)]
*  I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1438.74s)]
*  I'm so sorry for her loss, sincerely. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  But let's talk about what is happening right now [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1446.54s)]
*  with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1450.54s)]
*  Let's talk about that as well. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1455.24s)]
*  But do you want to answer that? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  I told you, I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1459.44s)]
*  No apology. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1464.24s)]
*  And the bill she's referring to would allow [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1466.44s)]
*  almost two million illegal immigrants into the country [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  and amnesty and a lot of people opposed it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1471.84s)]
*  And they had control of both houses of Congress. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1475.24s)]
*  As Brett pointed out, even Bill Clinton, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1477.74s)]
*  while campaigning for Kamala Harris, admitted [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1480.04s)]
*  Lake and Riley would be alive today [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1482.94s)]
*  if her killer had been properly vetted [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1485.74s)]
*  by the Harris-Biden administration, is what he said. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1489.04s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1493.1399999999999s)]
*  They made an ad about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1495.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1501.34s)]
*  that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1503.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, the borders are Kamala Harris [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1506.1399999999999s)]
*  takes zero responsibility for the border crisis. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1508.34s)]
*  And she also doesn't seem to remember calling the border secure, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1511.34s)]
*  something she repeated along with everyone else in the administration [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1514.84s)]
*  for three long years, or calling for illegal immigration to be decriminalized. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1518.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1524.54s)]
*  You said repeatedly that the border was secure. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1525.84s)]
*  When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1528.94s)]
*  I think we've had a broken immigration system [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1532.54s)]
*  transcending, by the way, Donald Trump's administration even before. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1535.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's all be honest about that. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1538.84s)]
*  When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1540.74s)]
*  in the country illegally to apply for driver's license, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1544.54s)]
*  to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free health care. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1547.34s)]
*  Do you still support those things? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1552.04s)]
*  Listen, that was five years ago, and I'm very clear that I will follow the law. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1554.04s)]
*  I have made that statement over and over again. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1558.24s)]
*  And as vice president of the United States, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  that's exactly what I've done, not to mention before. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1561.94s)]
*  If that's the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1565.64s)]
*  who is governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1568.44s)]
*  So decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1572.14s)]
*  I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1576.44s)]
*  and I've not done that as vice president. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1579.94s)]
*  I will not do that as president. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1581.8400000000001s)]
*  So these are evolutions that you've had. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1583.64s)]
*  Not a matter of following the law. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1586.94s)]
*  You stated you wanted to change the law. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1588.54s)]
*  You want to be president. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1590.94s)]
*  Since Kamala is trying to duck, dodge, and weave the question, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1592.34s)]
*  and blame Trump and avoid scrutiny, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1595.4399999999998s)]
*  let's take a look at what really happened. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  You decide. Take a look. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1599.84s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked Congress to do. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1604.24s)]
*  The first request we made, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1611.34s)]
*  pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1613.9399999999998s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1619.74s)]
*  We have to have a secure border, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1621.04s)]
*  but I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1623.04s)]
*  who are undocumented and cross the border as criminals. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1626.24s)]
*  That's correct. That is correct. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1628.34s)]
*  You support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1629.74s)]
*  to people who are in this country illegally? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1633.24s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1635.34s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1637.74s)]
*  any human being from access to public safety, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1642.1399999999999s)]
*  public education, or public health, period. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1647.1399999999999s)]
*  Now, Kamala supported taxpayer-funded sex change operations [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1650.94s)]
*  for not only convicts, but illegal immigrants in jail and other inmates. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1654.64s)]
*  But when Brett Baer asked about this, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1659.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, bizarre position that I don't think any American can support, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1662.04s)]
*  can you guess what she did? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1666.04s)]
*  Blame Donald Trump, the guy that built the wall, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1667.74s)]
*  implemented the stay in Mexico policies, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1670.44s)]
*  and had the lowest illegal immigration in modern history, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1672.64s)]
*  never supported taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1676.9399999999998s)]
*  but you got to give her an A for effort. Take a look. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1681.54s)]
*  Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1684.54s)]
*  to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1686.9399999999998s)]
*  to transition to another gender? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1689.4399999999998s)]
*  I will follow the law, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1691.9399999999998s)]
*  and it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1693.9399999999998s)]
*  You're probably familiar with, now it's a public report, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1697.34s)]
*  that under Donald Trump's administration, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1701.1399999999999s)]
*  these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1703.6399999999999s)]
*  to people in the federal prison system, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1710.04s)]
*  and I think, frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1712.84s)]
*  is a little bit of like throwing, you know, stones [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1716.04s)]
*  when you're living in a glass house. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1718.44s)]
*  The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1719.84s)]
*  and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1723.04s)]
*  Well, you know what, you got to take responsibility for what happened in your administration. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1726.04s)]
*  Yeah, no surgeries happened in his pres... presidency. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1728.24s)]
*  It's in black and white. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  Wow, she's just flat out lying. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1732.74s)]
*  In fact, the very first taxpayer-funded sex change surgery [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1734.64s)]
*  on a convicted felon was carried out in 2022. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1738.94s)]
*  Yeah, thanks to the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1742.44s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1745.14s)]
*  Under Kamala Harris, your hard-earned tax dollars [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1745.94s)]
*  being spent on costly breast augmentation [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1749.24s)]
*  and other gender-altering surgeries to convicted murderers, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1753.64s)]
*  other felons in prison, and she wants it for illegal immigrants. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1757.0400000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, two-thirds of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1760.94s)]
*  barely getting by amid historic levels of inflation. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1764.74s)]
*  Last month, 3.3 percent inflation up year over year. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1768.54s)]
*  In his interview, Brett featured this statistic, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1772.44s)]
*  showing a whopping 79 percent of you, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1775.04s)]
*  the American people, believe this country is on the wrong track [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1779.44s)]
*  after nearly four years under Harris and Biden. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1783.3400000000001s)]
*  According to Kamala, that's actually Donald Trump's fault, too. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1786.64s)]
*  Can't make it up. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1790.64s)]
*  More than 70 percent of people tell the country is on the wrong track. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1792.5400000000002s)]
*  They say the country is on the wrong track. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1796.24s)]
*  If it's on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1798.5400000000002s)]
*  of you being vice president and President Biden being president. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1803.14s)]
*  That is what they're saying, 79 percent of them. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1807.0400000000002s)]
*  Why are they saying that? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1810.44s)]
*  If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1811.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  But you've been the person holding the office. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1819.54s)]
*  Come on. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1821.24s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1822.04s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1824.04s)]
*  I actually don't. What are you talking about? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1825.34s)]
*  What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, people have become... [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1826.84s)]
*  But you're the lever of power. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1831.24s)]
*  You're vice president for three and a half years. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1834.34s)]
*  What is she talking about? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1836.1399999999999s)]
*  No wonder she showed up late. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  They gave Brett very limited time. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1840.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris is clearly in a state of denial, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1842.6399999999999s)]
*  living in an alternate universe, if you will, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1845.04s)]
*  where everything bad that ever happened in her administration [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1847.84s)]
*  is the fault of Donald Trump. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1851.34s)]
*  She wants to believe that because Donald Trump just breathes air and exists, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  that things started just happening under her watch. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1858.84s)]
*  Now, two new wars we have going on. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1861.84s)]
*  War in Europe, war in the Middle East, a historic border crisis. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1864.1399999999999s)]
*  It is real, a disaster and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1867.4399999999998s)]
*  She was the last person in the room. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1871.34s)]
*  Record-setting inflation that only recently she acknowledges [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1873.4399999999998s)]
*  and pledges she will deal with on day one, which was January 20th, 2021. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1877.14s)]
*  And backbreaking gas prices, massive disruptions in our supply chain. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1882.3400000000001s)]
*  And I can go on all night. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1887.64s)]
*  It was clear from day one, Joe Biden was not up to the job. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1889.3400000000001s)]
*  Not mentally, not cognitively, physically. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1893.44s)]
*  And Kamala was more than happy to look the other way [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1896.3400000000001s)]
*  and frankly flat-out lied to all of us. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1899.24s)]
*  Take a look at this answer. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  And we give thanks to our commander in chief, the president of the United States, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1903.34s)]
*  the extraordinary president of the United States, Joe Biden. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1908.94s)]
*  Ho, ho, ho. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1915.04s)]
*  Happy Independence Day. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1918.74s)]
*  Most people, but they're powerless. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1920.84s)]
*  I can't explain. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1923.84s)]
*  I need to see some black folk on the grass. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1925.54s)]
*  Fell from heaven like a shower. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1927.24s)]
*  Have to see some people on the grass. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1930.04s)]
*  I'm not being facetious. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1932.94s)]
*  Well, President Harris led this effort. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1935.14s)]
*  Led this effort to make things better. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1937.74s)]
*  And a pound of Ukrainian people, proud, proud people, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1939.94s)]
*  pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of earnings that they have. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1943.84s)]
*  If Kamala will lie for three years about the cognitive abilities [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1948.84s)]
*  of the president of our country, the president of the United States of America, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, what won't she lie about? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1958.04s)]
*  Today in Georgia, Donald Trump sat down for a town hall with an all-female audience. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1960.34s)]
*  They would have asked me to appear, but they didn't want everyone fainting. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1965.6399999999999s)]
*  Of course, Kamala also wanted to do a town hall with just women, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1969.1399999999999s)]
*  but her staff couldn't define one. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1973.24s)]
*  After banning pub crawls due to public complaints, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1976.04s)]
*  people are accusing Prague of becoming a nanny state. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1979.54s)]
*  Did someone say nanny? asks one man. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1984.04s)]
*  According to a newly revised FBI stats, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1992.04s)]
*  violent crime in America has actually gone up, not down, as Democrats claim. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=1995.54s)]
*  Kamala Harris is now promising that if elected, she will ban math. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2000.54s)]
*  Reports say Donald Trump may work at a McDonald's during a campaign stop and P.A. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2005.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala will also spend a day at a job she's never worked, vice president. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2010.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2021.04s)]
*  According to a report from the Public Interest Legal Foundation, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2023.04s)]
*  hundreds of Arizona voters allegedly registered to vote [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2026.54s)]
*  using strip clubs and street clubs. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2030.04s)]
*  They also registered to vote using strip clubs, abortion clinics, and high schools as home addresses. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2033.04s)]
*  Or as Hunter calls it, great places to meet babes. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2040.04s)]
*  According to a new documentary, Christopher Columbus may have been Jewish. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2047.04s)]
*  Yeah, instead of searching for a new route to the Far East, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2052.04s)]
*  he was only looking for a restaurant that's open on Christmas. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2055.04s)]
*  And finally, a Disney World cake shop is under fire for having prices that start at $22 per slice. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2063.04s)]
*  You mean I have to spend $220 for dinner? asks one man. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2072.04s)]
*  Why not? He loves it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2082.04s)]
*  All right. So Border Patrol agents are vowing that they're going to leave in droves if Kamala wins in November. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2086.04s)]
*  This follows the earlier endorsement of Donald Trump by the Border Patrol Union. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2093.04s)]
*  Strange, you'd think the person labeled the Border Czar would have had this endorsement all sewn up. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2098.04s)]
*  She should have been a shoe-in like me for best abs at the Teen Choice Awards. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2104.04s)]
*  I got robbed. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2110.04s)]
*  Truth is, all these Border Patrol officers fleeing their jobs will be joining a herd of others fleeing their life's work [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2113.04s)]
*  because they know the Dems don't want them doing it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2119.04s)]
*  It's mostly men fleeing traditional male jobs, cops, firemen, teamsters, jobs that often involve serious physical labor or upper body strength. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2122.04s)]
*  You know, I never realized it before, but upper body strength is kind of sexist. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2131.04s)]
*  I guess God was a misogynist. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2136.04s)]
*  Wow, that didn't work. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2139.04s)]
*  Bottom line, those who go into professions like these do it for the mission, not the money. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2144.04s)]
*  There's not a buttload of Border Patrol whose other car is a Lamborghini. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2151.04s)]
*  And if you take that mission away by denicrating the work they do, you can expect a rush for the exits that you usually see at a Jets game by the third quarter. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2156.04s)]
*  And the Dems are wondering why they're doing poorly with men. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2166.04s)]
*  Well, you can try not labeling their central purpose as evil, maybe less redefining and more respecting. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2169.04s)]
*  Stop saying they're whipping people when it's just Larry Kudlow. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2176.04s)]
*  Now, what if the teachers or nurses unions made a similar statement that if Trump were elected, they would walk off the job? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2181.04s)]
*  Can you imagine the level of media handwringing screeching about Trump not valuing the work of these heroes? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2188.04s)]
*  And yes, I know there are male nurses and teachers. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2194.04s)]
*  They're always hitting on me. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2197.04s)]
*  And there are female cops and firefighters, too. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2201.04s)]
*  Although I would prefer it's a man who carries me out of my burning apartment, preferably Ryan Gosling. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2204.04s)]
*  But whatever your gender is, I respect you for doing these jobs. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2211.04s)]
*  I don't want to do them. That's for sure. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2215.04s)]
*  You think I want to run up a flight of stairs into a burning building to grab my bodybuilding trophies? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2217.04s)]
*  That's what personal assistants are for. And I'm going to wait in the limo. Thank you very much. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2222.04s)]
*  But we need these jobs and the Dems need to stop villainizing them. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2227.04s)]
*  How demoralized does the Border Patrol feel? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2231.04s)]
*  Well, according to the Washington Examiner, they've lost more than 4000 personnel since 2020. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2234.04s)]
*  That's almost 20 percent of their workforce. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2239.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, police departments nationwide cannot recruit or retain their headcount. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2242.04s)]
*  It's the hidden version of defunding. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2246.04s)]
*  Tens of thousands of cops' salaries have been saved because they never took the job to begin with. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2248.04s)]
*  They made it a job Americans truly don't want to do, like working for Kamala Harris. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2254.04s)]
*  She's lost more employees than the Titanic. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2260.04s)]
*  Wow. Frankly, frankly, it's a miracle any cop still shows up for work. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2264.04s)]
*  AOC must be skipping down Broadway with her bodyguards, of course. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2273.04s)]
*  Thanks to no cash bail and other criminal coddling reforms, arrested perps are back on the street before you can say, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2278.04s)]
*  hey, where the f*** is my wallet? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2284.04s)]
*  But imagine that whatever you do for a living is every day undone before your day is over. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2287.04s)]
*  I think my writers can relate to that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2292.04s)]
*  But what would you, what would that do to your morale? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2295.04s)]
*  How must it feel to stand out on the southern border under the baking sun trying to guard the nation from a legal entrance, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2298.04s)]
*  only to be told that you're the problem? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2305.04s)]
*  Remember this gem from Kamala? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2308.04s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2311.04s)]
*  And we need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it's conducting itself. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2319.04s)]
*  And we need to deal with that. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2327.04s)]
*  Now, to be fair, she is a moron. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2329.04s)]
*  But... [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2334.04s)]
*  Oh, oh, I feel dirty. And I should. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2337.04s)]
*  But the entire agency charged with handling cartels and other migrant criminals is, in Kamala world, what's really illegal. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2342.04s)]
*  Maybe that's why Customs and Border Patrol had 15 suicides in 2022 alone, forcing them to hire their first suicidologist. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2349.04s)]
*  I think the View had to hire one for all of those men working their cameras. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2358.04s)]
*  But that's what happens when the mission loses its value, when you're not only told that the work you believed in is evil, but that you've been the bad guy all along. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2364.04s)]
*  And yes, generally, that means guy, you know, as in those evil monsters with the Y chromosome lumbering around among us. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2373.04s)]
*  So the Dems and the media can try to redefine masculinity all they want. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2380.04s)]
*  They could pay actors to play real men for Kamala all day long. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2384.04s)]
*  But it's failing because no matter who wins next month, the real truth is, real men and real women know how much we need Border Patrol officers and men like them. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2388.04s)]
*  The truth is, we can't do without them. Unlike Kamala. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4xQEWbdy78&t=2398.04s)]
