# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 9 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc)
*  There's been a reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=0.0s)]
*  and outright lies about what's going on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=5.04s)]
*  It's undermining confidence in the people in Florida. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=8.52s)]
*  Why do you think Trump is spreading misinformation? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=11.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=13.3s)]
*  I simply don't know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=15.3s)]
*  You can speculate, but I just find it, I'm not using the phrase more than I've used it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=17.6s)]
*  ever in my whole career, un-American. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=25.46s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  I don't know who the hell we are. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=28.74s)]
*  What are they talking about? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=30.979999999999997s)]
*  Now this is so predictable. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=33.54s)]
*  So Floridians are focused on survival, not politics. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=35.78s)]
*  But Democrats and their media lackeys were busy with another type of disaster relief [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=41.2s)]
*  today, a rescue operation for Kamala's campaign. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=45.34s)]
*  As they have so many times before, they're trying to deflect and even silence their political [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=49.94s)]
*  opponents. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=54.42s)]
*  And Kamala seems like she's desperately trying to turn the page from her underwhelming media [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=55.88s)]
*  tour. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  So she jumped on the disinfo bandwagon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Are we concerned about any misinformation or disinformation regarding evacuations that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=65.8s)]
*  we need to clear up at this point? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=71.72s)]
*  There's been a lot of misinformation out there, Madam Vice President, that's for sure. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  But what is all of this misinformation they're so worried about? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=80.84s)]
*  Former President Trump has led this onslaught of lies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=86.0s)]
*  Assertions have been made that property is being confiscated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=89.2s)]
*  It's simply not true. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh wait, where did Biden find people saying that property is being confiscated? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=94.84s)]
*  Well after some digging, we found the White House sourced a single Twitter account with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  fewer than 5000 followers for that bit of misinformation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=107.62s)]
*  So if anyone is amplifying disinformation from fringe sources, it's the Democrats themselves [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=112.5s)]
*  and Biden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=118.66000000000001s)]
*  Yet with battleground poll numbers trending toward Trump, the pro-Harris media, they're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  panicked, they're frustrated, which means a return to the echo chamber. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=125.9s)]
*  There is a significant amount of misinformation being spread. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  They are keenly aware of the misinformation that is currently circulating on all corners [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=135.36s)]
*  of the internet. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=140.38s)]
*  It's something that is obviously so concerning to the administration and we're really seeing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=141.38s)]
*  the effects of it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=145.22s)]
*  And again, what are they basing this on? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=148.94s)]
*  One of the things that has struck me about Hurricane Milton, the way that I've heard [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=152.82s)]
*  people discussing this storm and the sort of distrust about what this storm actually [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=157.18s)]
*  is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=164.82s)]
*  I spoke to an elderly woman who told me that she believed that this hurricane was geoengineered. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=165.82s)]
*  Okay so now one random woman that he ran into makes a CNN disinformation narrative? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  Now the truth is FEMA is also doing its own damage control because it hurt its own credibility. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=181.46s)]
*  Now last night on The Angle we exposed the agency-wide prioritization of diversity, equity [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  and inclusion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=194.38s)]
*  And Fox of course has already documented their slow-footed response to Hurricane Helene. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=196.06s)]
*  We just feel like we're being forgotten. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  We haven't received any response from FEMA. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  We're not getting the amount of support that we need. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=206.88s)]
*  We haven't seen FEMA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=209.26s)]
*  We haven't seen Red Cross. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=210.26s)]
*  We haven't seen Harvest with hands. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=211.26s)]
*  We've seen no agencies come today here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=212.26s)]
*  There's so much more that could be done and giving us $750 if you can even apply for it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=216.98s)]
*  is ridiculous. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=222.62s)]
*  $750 isn't going to do anything even if you do get approved. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=223.62s)]
*  But FEMA wants you to feel sorry for them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  The environment's been very tough the last couple of weeks with all of the information [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=231.7s)]
*  that we've been, this information that we've been seeing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=234.7s)]
*  It's difficult to operate when we don't have trust and trust in those institutions that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=237.3s)]
*  are built in there to protect people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=241.02s)]
*  And so we need to continue to push forward on getting that accurate information out there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  That's what we've been doing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=247.06s)]
*  Oh, it's hard for them? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=248.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=250.18s)]
*  Well, the truth is the Biden-Harris administration did not get its act together until public [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=251.18s)]
*  outrage grew and Americans realized how FEMA was actually spending our money. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  And yeah, it's our money. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=262.1s)]
*  And also when we discovered that it was obvious that the feds hadn't pre-deployed enough resources [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=264.1s)]
*  despite knowing how bad the hurricane was actually going to be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=270.14000000000004s)]
*  But now Harris and Biden are trying to spin their failures as misinformation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=274.5s)]
*  But again, other than a few fringe theories out there, there are certain facts that are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  beyond dispute. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  First, FEMA did neglect residents in areas ravaged by Hurricane Helene as exposed by [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=286.1s)]
*  the victims themselves. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=292.18s)]
*  And it wasn't until they started speaking out and Elon Musk publicly criticized the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=294.22s)]
*  trouble he was having getting his Starlink terminals dropped into affected areas that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  things finally started improving. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=303.5s)]
*  Second, DHS Secretary Mayorkas literally told us they were running out of money for FEMA [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  hurricane assistance. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=320.04s)]
*  We do not have the funds. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=322.92s)]
*  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=324.44s)]
*  Third, FEMA allocated over $640 million this year alone to sheltering migrants. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  So combine this with other money that DHS, which oversees FEMA, has already spent on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=338.44s)]
*  resettling migrants since 2021. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  And we're talking billions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=347.12s)]
*  We don't even know how much, but billions and billions of dollars since Biden and Harris [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=349.2s)]
*  took office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=353.72s)]
*  And this money, of course, should be spent and allocated to shoring up disaster management [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=355.4s)]
*  for Americans, not on illegal aliens. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=361.8s)]
*  Fourth, in addition to the billions for the care of migrants, Kamala just boasted about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=366.52s)]
*  $157 million that her administration greenlit to go to Lebanon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=372.68s)]
*  So instead of addressing the substantive criticisms, the Harris camp and their immediate protectorate [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=379.44s)]
*  is sprinkling their hurricane warnings with just totally irrelevant, petty, and nonsensical [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=385.2s)]
*  smears. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  It is unconscionable, frankly, that anyone who would consider themselves a leader would [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  mislead desperate people. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=398.44s)]
*  The last thing that they deserve is to have a so-called leader make them more afraid than [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=400.76s)]
*  they already are. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=405.96s)]
*  The gamesmanship has to stop. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=407.4s)]
*  At some point, the politics have to end, especially in a moment of crisis. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=409.24s)]
*  You know what was unconscionable? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=413.32s)]
*  That you were in Vegas at a campaign event when this hurricane was ripping through North [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=416.0s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=421.2s)]
*  Yeah, you're the vice president still, remember? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=422.2s)]
*  Look, what we know from our experience with COVID is that powerful forces collaborated [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=425.56s)]
*  with government institutions to censor their critics. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  And now, all these years later, we see that many of the physicians who were censored or [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=436.22s)]
*  punished during COVID were in fact telling the truth. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=439.8s)]
*  The same censorship happened surrounding the Hunter Biden laptop in the fall of 2020, right [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  before the vote. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  And now, 27 days until this year's election, and they're engaged in the same type of censorship [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=451.04s)]
*  tactic. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  But we won't let them get away with it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=458.92s)]
*  As Hurricane Milton brings biblical damage to Florida, Biden came out today and defended [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=461.48s)]
*  his administration's slow response to Hurricane Helene, calling any criticism of it disinformation [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=466.8s)]
*  and pointing fingers at Trump. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=473.56s)]
*  There's been reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=476.2s)]
*  outright lies about what's going on. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=481.03999999999996s)]

*  Assertions have been made that property is being confiscated. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=487.64s)]
*  That's simply not true. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=491.64s)]

*  That is simply not true either. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=499.38s)]

*  It's outrageous. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=509.04s)]
*  It's just not true. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=510.04s)]
*  Biden's fighting Trump harder than the hurricane. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=511.44s)]
*  If he should be angry at anybody, he should be angry at his team. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=514.0s)]
*  They didn't pre-position assets in North Carolina to help in the foothills. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=517.54s)]
*  Just like Afghanistan and the border, the hurricane's now Trump's fault. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=522.08s)]
*  Americans have lost power, their homes, some of them even their husbands. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=527.04s)]
*  They're not worried about what politicians say on TV. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=531.72s)]

*  It's a God-given right of every American. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=541.9s)]

*  like a PR battle. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=550.26s)]

*  North Carolina seized the aftermath and Biden and Harris were late. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=617.1s)]
*  So what are they claiming is disinformation? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=622.54s)]
*  Number one, FEMA is seizing property. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=625.86s)]
*  Trump never said that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=629.38s)]
*  Number two, people wouldn't get more than $750. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=631.38s)]
*  Trump never said that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=635.5s)]
*  Oh, and then the migrant money, that came from them. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=636.74s)]
*  Mayorkas said FEMA was going to run out of money for hurricane season and FEMA admitted [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  they wasted a billion on migrants. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=646.02s)]
*  Now I'm not great at math. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=648.46s)]
*  If I were, I'd work on Wall Street. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  But if you spend too much money on one thing and don't have enough money for another thing, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=651.9399999999999s)]
*  that means you messed up. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=657.34s)]
*  But if someone's making crazy claims on the Internet about FEMA, so what? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=659.22s)]
*  The president of the United States shouldn't be amplifying it at a press conference. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=663.62s)]
*  No one had ever heard about most of this misinformation until Biden repeated it in front of the nation. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=669.0799999999999s)]
*  All of this silliness is designed to distract the media from covering Biden's failure in [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=676.02s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=681.02s)]
*  He makes the story about Trump so the story's not about him. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=682.62s)]
*  And the media just goes along. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=685.98s)]
*  Even CNN's confronting the administration about not being prepared. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=688.58s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  After Helene made landfall in the United States on September 26, Joe Biden was at his house [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  in Rehoboth Beach. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=696.98s)]

*  celebrities. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=703.42s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was in Los Angeles presiding over an award [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=704.42s)]

*  How do you respond to those accusations from Jay Vance? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=709.62s)]

*  words. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=724.74s)]
*  And so criticizing Democrats counterproductive, but criticizing Republicans is saving lives [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=725.74s)]
*  by combating misinformation. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=732.36s)]
*  You got that? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=734.36s)]
*  What's counterproductive is leaving Americans hanging, but bending over backwards to help [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=736.04s)]
*  foreigners who broke into the country. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  Americans have to wait weeks for $750 when they lost their home. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=743.72s)]

*  But even so-called scientists are going on TV and saying if you vote for Kamala Harris, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=786.62s)]
*  hurricanes will shrink. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=792.54s)]

*  And almost a full two weeks after the disaster caused by Hurricane Helene, let's be very [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=952.2199999999999s)]
*  clear here, Harris and Biden's response to Hurricane Helene, to this devastating hurricane, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=957.36s)]
*  has been the absolute worst in American history. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=963.96s)]
*  But now we're on the verge of an election, a rare sighting today. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=967.82s)]
*  Kamala Harris actually attended a hurricane briefing, but it did not exactly go well for [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=971.2s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  She stumbled and stammered over her words while trying so hard to sound so well-informed, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=977.4000000000001s)]
*  which she's not. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=982.36s)]
*  At one point, she even tried to talk to a staffer on a hot mic by covering her mouth [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  like this with her hands. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=988.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=990.04s)]
*  To the people of Florida, and in particular, the people of the Tampa region, we urge you [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=991.04s)]
*  to take this storm seriously. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=999.4799999999999s)]
*  For some of these type of traditional places that could flood, we really got to watch those [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1001.8s)]
*  areas and those communities. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1007.68s)]
*  So it takes quite a while for that water to drain. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1013.4399999999999s)]
*  Hey, Ken, I have a question for you. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned Words Matter, and I know there is a lot of media following this briefing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1017.16s)]
*  For almost four years, she never once called Governor DeSantis. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1025.84s)]
*  Not one time when there was a hurricane in the state of Florida. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1028.68s)]
*  Not once. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  And then she tried to politicize it this week. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, Governor DeSantis was on my radio show today. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1036.48s)]
*  She has over 50,000 people staged to follow in right after this hurricane that's going [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1040.12s)]
*  to work its way across the state tonight. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  Now that awkward showing by Kamala, one of many of her recent public appearance disasters [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1049.2399999999998s)]
*  after barely even talking off script for months, Harris is now suddenly participating in a [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1055.36s)]
*  flurry of interviews with her friends in the state-run media mob. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  We have speculated since Monday that her internal polls must be atrocious. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  And today, we have a little confirmation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1069.62s)]
*  Not exactly a conservative. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1072.02s)]
*  Journalist Mark Halpern listened to what he had to say. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1073.4199999999998s)]
*  What's happening now with Kamala Harris is, this is an experiment. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1077.3s)]
*  Can you win a short campaign with an untested candidate? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1080.7399999999998s)]
*  And what I'm telling you is happening in private polling is she's got a problem now. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1083.9799999999998s)]
*  OK? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1088.34s)]
*  It's not cheering for Trump. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1089.34s)]
*  It's not predicting Trump will win. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1090.34s)]
*  She's got a problem. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1091.6599999999999s)]
*  For you Harris people on here complaining that we're talking about problems in the Harris [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1092.7399999999998s)]
*  campaign, you're welcome to put your head in the sand about it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1096.4599999999998s)]
*  If you want to go watch MSNBC primetime and hear how great things are going for the Harris [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1099.22s)]
*  campaign, you're welcome to do that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1103.18s)]
*  But if you want to understand what's actually happening, we're here to tell you. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1105.22s)]
*  I just saw some new private polling today that's very robust private polling. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1108.5s)]
*  She's in a lot of trouble. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1112.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, I guess the joy is gone. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1114.34s)]
*  Panic has completely set in at the Harris campaign. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1116.82s)]
*  Even Quinnipiac polls out just today show Harris losing both Wisconsin and Michigan. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1119.88s)]
*  She's down four points in Michigan in this poll. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1125.22s)]
*  She is down two points in Wisconsin. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1128.42s)]
*  She's down two points. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1131.54s)]
*  We see in Pennsylvania a new poll out by insider advantage. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1132.54s)]
*  That's Matt Tower. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1136.9s)]
*  He will join us later in the program. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1137.9s)]
*  And by the way, that's the most recent poll. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1140.3400000000001s)]
*  She is massively underperforming both Biden in 2020 and Hillary in 2016. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1143.0600000000002s)]
*  Real clear politics shows on this very date, October 9th, 2016, Hillary Clinton was up [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1148.46s)]
*  nearly five points. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1153.94s)]
*  Well, in this state in 2020, Biden was up 9.7. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1155.5s)]
*  Today, 2024, it is a 2.0 point race. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1159.3400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1163.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, if Kamala was a capable leader and not just a spineless, mediocre politician [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1164.6200000000001s)]
*  hiding her true beliefs, hiding from the media, hiding from the American people, and if she [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1170.5s)]
*  actually really cared about people, as she proclaims, she would have been on the ground [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1175.46s)]
*  in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and leading recovery efforts. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1180.6599999999999s)]
*  She's been completely missing in action. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1187.1399999999999s)]
*  She's been picking fake fights with Donald Trump, Florida Governor, Rhonda Santis, in [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1189.3s)]
*  the middle of two deadly hurricanes, stumbling her way through a 60 minutes interview. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1193.62s)]
*  That turned out to be a disaster. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1198.86s)]
*  And despite some heavy lifting from the edit department at CBS, you know, still didn't [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  work out well. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1205.8999999999999s)]
*  She's also giggling, as per usual, showing up on a podcast named Call Her Daddy and talking [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1206.98s)]
*  about raisin bran with Howard Stern in a suit, sipping tea with the ladies of The View and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1213.02s)]
*  cracking a cold beer with Stephen Colbert instead of helping the people of North Carolina and [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1218.94s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1223.7800000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1224.7800000000002s)]
*  Elections, I think, are won on vibes because one of the old saws is they just want somebody [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1225.7800000000002s)]
*  they can have a beer with. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1229.66s)]
*  So would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1231.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1235.54s)]
*  This was, now we asked ahead of time because I can't just be given a drink to the Vice [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1236.54s)]
*  President of the United States, let's ask you. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1241.38s)]
*  You asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1242.74s)]
*  You asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1244.22s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1246.5s)]
*  Okay, the last time I had beer was at a baseball game with Doug. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1247.5s)]
*  Okay, so cheers. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1254.6200000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1255.6200000000001s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1260.6200000000001s)]
*  That tastes like the beautiful city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1262.02s)]
*  The champagne and beers. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1265.02s)]
*  People in states like Georgia, North Carolina abandoned and she's giggling and yucking [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1269.02s)]
*  it up and drinking beer with Stephen Colbert. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1272.8999999999999s)]
*  Americans in multiple states have lost everything. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1276.2199999999998s)]
*  The entire state of Florida is getting ravaged right at this hour as we speak in my home [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1278.4599999999998s)]

*  This is the second major hurricane in this state. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1287.1399999999999s)]
*  In two weeks, Kamala is drinking beer on the set with Stephen Colbert, yucking it up on [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1289.94s)]
*  the Call Me Daddy podcast, the Ladies with the View, a woke Howard Stern, the old Howard [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1294.58s)]
*  Stern, whatever happened to him. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1300.3s)]
*  And she's also randomly trying out a what, fake Jamaican accent on Colbert's show. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1302.3s)]
*  What, this is supposed to be funny or something? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1307.54s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1310.1399999999999s)]
*  It's crude. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  Have you no empathy, man? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1312.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1315.1399999999999s)]
*  No, for the suffering of other people. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1316.5s)]
*  Have you no sense of purpose if you purport to be a leader? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1320.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if that was the tape we called for, but empathy? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1329.7800000000002s)]
*  She was talking about Donald Trump in that cut. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1333.74s)]
*  Empathy? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1335.7800000000002s)]
*  Why hasn't she been in North Carolina? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1336.7800000000002s)]
*  The audience was obviously confused. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1338.8600000000001s)]
*  So, are we not one of these, you know, if we're not one of these cupcake interviews, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1341.42s)]
*  they're not going to help her. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1346.78s)]
*  These are people that already support her with dwindling audiences. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1348.46s)]
*  Earlier in the day, the vice president telling the Ladies with the View that she can't think [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1351.66s)]
*  of a single thing she would have done differently than Joe Biden. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1355.54s)]
*  Not one. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1358.54s)]
*  Not the borders, the economy, not the high cost of energy, not defund, dismantle police [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1359.54s)]
*  and ICE, not giving 200 billion to Ukraine and making the Iranians filthy rich. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1364.36s)]
*  But a few hours later, Uncle Bear, she couldn't come up with a single thing. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1370.58s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  You are a member of the president administration. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1376.22s)]
*  Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be and what would stay the same? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1378.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1385.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1386.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1388.22s)]
*  And so that would be one change in terms of... [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1389.22s)]
*  But also, I think it's important to say with 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1393.54s)]
*  And so when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1401.46s)]
*  looks like, were I to be elected president, it is about, frankly, I love the American [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1406.18s)]
*  people and I believe in our country. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1413.78s)]
*  I love that it is our character in nature to be an ambitious people. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1417.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay, more cliché. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1425.3s)]
*  She wouldn't change a thing. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1426.74s)]
*  She's no Donald Trump. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1428.34s)]
*  I agree, because the border would be secure, the economy would rebound and people around [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1429.3799999999999s)]
*  the world would respect us. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1434.6999999999998s)]
*  And what's most pathetic about this ass kissing media tour is Joe and Kamala and FEMA's horrific [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1436.3799999999999s)]
*  response across the southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1443.34s)]
*  Does Kamala really think her government is doing a great job? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1447.5s)]
*  Does she agree with Joe Biden that the victims in North Carolina, Georgia and everywhere [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1450.3s)]
*  in between are getting everything they need and everybody's happy? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1456.14s)]
*  Because that's what Joe said last week. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1460.0600000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1462.46s)]
*  Now we are hearing a much different story on the ground. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1483.46s)]
*  We've had our own Sarah Carter been reporting from the hardest hit areas in North Carolina [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1486.06s)]
*  and elsewhere all week. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1490.5s)]
*  Nobody has gotten the help that they deserve. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1492.34s)]
*  And perhaps if they were in the country illegally, well then they probably would be treated better, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1494.74s)]
*  wouldn't they? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1499.82s)]
*  Free housing, food, healthcare, education. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1500.82s)]
*  Let's see, sex change operations, amnesty, legal drivers licenses and free college. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1503.3s)]
*  Anyway, you're not even allowed to mention, you know, any of this in any way, shape, manner [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1508.54s)]
*  or form or criticize the government for their horrific response because they get very upset. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1514.86s)]
*  They think it's not helpful. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1520.54s)]
*  And you have these far left media outlets like, you know, Medi-ite, MSDNC, Fake News [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1521.54s)]
*  CNN. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1526.9399999999998s)]
*  They actually want you to believe any criticism of Harris, Biden, FEMA is misinformation. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1527.9399999999998s)]
*  No, it's the truth because FEMA and the Biden and Harris administration, they got caught [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1533.54s)]
*  flat footed. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1540.2199999999998s)]
*  They did nothing. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1541.54s)]
*  They had next to nothing prepositioned knowing for days that a massive hurricane was about [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1542.84s)]
*  to hit the country. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1548.3s)]
*  Governors like DeSantis and Kemp and McMaster, they all prepositioned state resources, people, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  utility trucks, supplies, manpower all ahead of time. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1555.48s)]
*  FEMA, Joe, Kamala missing in action. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1559.4399999999998s)]
*  Joe sat on his ass on the beach. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1561.9199999999998s)]
*  Kamala was hanging out in Hollywood with the rich, elitist Hollywood friends. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1564.04s)]
*  Six days later, Secretary of Homeland Security, Mayorca said, yeah, FEMA is apparently in [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1568.12s)]
*  shambles financially and we probably don't have enough money for hurricane season. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1574.32s)]
*  And then we discovered on FEMA's own website that the agency distributed more than a billion [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1579.1999999999998s)]
*  dollars to house, to house and feed Harris and Biden unvetted illegal immigrants a billion [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1584.2399999999998s)]
*  dollars over the last two years. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1591.36s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk_QpmGgCzc&t=1593.1999999999998s)]
