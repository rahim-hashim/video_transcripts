# Fox News Highlights - May 22nd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4)
*  A big, beautiful victory. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=0.0s)]
*  In the wee hours of the morning, House Republicans showed they are capable of governing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=5.0s)]
*  The media and the Democrats have consistently dismissed any possibility that House Republicans could get this done. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=11.0s)]
*  They did not believe that we could succeed in our mission to enact President Trump's America First agenda. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=17.0s)]
*  But this is a big one. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=23.0s)]
*  The big, beautiful bill delivers on most key elements of the Trump agenda, such as permanently extending his 2017 tax cuts. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=25.0s)]
*  That's a big one. Medicaid work requirements. It's about time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=33.0s)]
*  Green energy cuts. Maybe not enough. But no tax on tips or overtime pay. That's big. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=36.0s)]
*  And higher tax deductions for seniors after a period of four years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=42.0s)]
*  New funding for the border, defense, money for ICE. 25-bill to kickstart construction of the Golden Dome. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are legitimate concerns about deficit spending. We'll get to that in a bit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=54.0s)]
*  Angle's press Republicans on this. But let there be no mistake. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=58.0s)]
*  This is still a historic MAGA victory. One that out of touch liberals, by the way, and you remember, they thought was never going to come to pass. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=62.0s)]
*  Because last year, literally just one year ago, they thought Trump might be headed to jail. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=70.0s)]
*  And they thought Mike Johnson might be headed for a crash and burn. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=76.0s)]
*  He's one of the weakest speakers that we have ever seen in that chair. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=80.0s)]
*  Republicans in the House led by Speaker Mike Johnson are breaking records and setting the bar for ineffectiveness. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=85.0s)]
*  Ineffectiveness? How many times did they use that word to describe the guy who truly was ineffective at the job, the basic job of the presidency? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=90.0s)]
*  Now, the truth is, while Trump, Johnson and their teams were working hard to get the votes they needed to pass this legislation, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=100.0s)]
*  so-called journalists, we've been seeing a lot of them running around lately and political analysts, they were all asleep at the wheel because their partisan views were blinding them to the truth. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=107.0s)]
*  You know what the truth is? Trump's just better than about anyone else out there at politics. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=118.0s)]
*  Working with Speaker Johnson, Trump was always going to get the votes he needed. I never had a doubt about that, including from the Freedom Caucus, at least the ones he needed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=126.0s)]
*  But the incurious minds couldn't see it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=135.0s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries not going to come to his rescue anymore, Mike Johnson, the Speaker. He's going to have to do it entirely with his own majority. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=138.0s)]
*  The Freedom Caucus provides obstacles. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=143.0s)]
*  He has a razor thin majority. They're going to need Democrats. Republican leadership, especially in the House, cannot do it. Mike Johnson can't do it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=148.0s)]
*  Peter Baker was right. Hakeem Johnson wasn't going to help them, but all the other ones are wrong, wrong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=155.0s)]
*  They didn't need Democrats. Every Republican voted for this. It didn't need a rescue, Peter. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=160.0s)]
*  Only two voted for it, Tom Massey, Warren Davidson. So are the analysts and the reporters giving Speaker Johnson any credit tonight? Of course not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=168.0s)]
*  But not too long ago, they knew how to celebrate the effectiveness of another speaker whose agenda they agreed with. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=177.0s)]
*  Objectively speaking, I was like, oh my gosh, Nancy Pelosi is a boss. I mean, she handled herself amazingly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=185.0s)]
*  She did not come to play. She was a complete and utter boss. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=195.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is known for doing, for getting the votes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=198.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is really the whip. She's the vote counter. She knows how to keep her caucus together. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=201.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is mature. She is professional. She's extremely good at her job. Donald Trump is not. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=205.0s)]
*  Very mature, John. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=213.0s)]
*  Look, the last 48 hours shows this once again that Donald Trump knows more about politics than anyone else, at least in the past 50 years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=223.0s)]
*  No one, and I mean no one, can touch him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=233.0s)]
*  And Mike Johnson was smart enough to see that and effectively partnered with him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=237.0s)]
*  Trump made the trip to the Hill to underscore that he meant business. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=242.0s)]
*  It was old style politicking. Trump bargained with blue state Republicans on taxes and quelled the rebellion from conservatives over spending. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=246.0s)]
*  But there was one guy they were never going to win over. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=254.0s)]
*  You watch next year. We'll spend more money than we did this year. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=258.0s)]
*  And the year after that we will too. This this budget will add at least 30 trillion dollars to the debt over the next 10 years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=261.0s)]
*  And it's a Republican budget. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=269.0s)]
*  Well, the debt is a ticking time bomb. That's for sure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=272.0s)]
*  And because of the trillions in deficit spending in this bill, buyers of U.S. debt are increasingly skeptical that Congress will ever get serious about these spending cuts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=275.0s)]
*  So their argument is that this could have disastrous economic consequences for the country and has to be dealt with. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=284.0s)]
*  And now the bill moves to the Senate where Republicans are already conceding some of this problem. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=290.0s)]
*  I think there's some opportunities for more efficiency, some more savings, and there's still a lot of decisions to be made. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=297.0s)]
*  So I think we're talking about weeks or months. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=303.0s)]
*  Let's don't get high on our horse here that we've somehow made some major advancement of reducing spending because we didn't. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=305.0s)]
*  All right. Let's start. Start with the Pentagon, Lindsay. All right. Of course, on the flip side, if the Democrats get back into power, they have zero intention of ever cutting any spending except maybe on border enforcement. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=312.0s)]
*  All Hakeem Jeffries could do in the middle of the night was spit in the wind about the guy whose team found billions in savings. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=325.0s)]
*  Waste, fraud and abuse has been presented in a compelling way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=332.0s)]
*  At the same time, when Elon Musk and his federal contracts are worth eight million dollars a day, if you're trying to find waste, fraud and abuse, I have a suggestion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=338.0s)]
*  Start right there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=353.0s)]
*  Now, this is an unserious man and an unserious party. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=356.0s)]
*  Trump and Johnson did what they could do with the votes they had. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=361.0s)]
*  And as usual, Democrats bold predictions of failure were wrong again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=366.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=372.0s)]
*  So the summer of love is back and we haven't even made it to Memorial Day. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=374.0s)]
*  In the last few months, a health care exec was assassinated outside his hotel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=378.0s)]
*  Tesla's started getting fire bombed, IVF clinics torched. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=382.0s)]
*  Oh, and they even tried to burn down Governor Shapiro's house in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=387.0s)]
*  What do they all have in common? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=391.0s)]
*  They're all leftists and they're not mostly peaceful. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=393.0s)]
*  Overnight, a young couple in Washington was executed in cold blood. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=396.0s)]
*  Two Israeli diplomats who were in love were gunned down, leaving a Jewish museum. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=400.0s)]
*  The assassin fired several times after the victims fell to the ground. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=406.0s)]
*  Videos showed the gunman leaning in and firing several more times. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=410.0s)]
*  As one of them crawled away, the shooter fired again, reloaded, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=415.0s)]
*  and then shot even more rounds into her body. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=419.0s)]
*  The suspect was arrested on the scene and went berserk. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=422.0s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=426.0s)]
*  Witnesses say before this guy was arrested, security accidentally led him into the museum, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=436.0s)]
*  thinking he was a victim, and people inside had no idea they were face to face with a killer. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=441.0s)]
*  My thought was this poor man experienced a shooting. Do you need water? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=448.0s)]
*  I looked the killer in the eyes and said, can I get you water? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=453.0s)]
*  He said, yes, that would be great. And I walked to get it to him and I literally handed it off. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=456.0s)]
*  Unbeknownst to me, moments ago, this man had execution style, killed two people, not one shot. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=461.0s)]
*  We're talking multiple gunshots. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=466.0s)]
*  And I looked evil right in the eye and there he was. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=469.0s)]
*  Seconds after I handed him the water, he brandishes the keffiyeh, yells, free Palestine, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=473.0s)]
*  and then he's apprehended and that's how it all unfolded. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=477.0s)]
*  So who was this guy? Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=479.0s)]
*  He's 31 and a former member of the Socialism Liberation Party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=483.0s)]
*  He's a BLM'er and a Biden donor. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=488.0s)]
*  Reports say on social media, Rodriguez praised Luigi Mangione, the UnitedHealthcare assassin. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=491.0s)]
*  Neighbors thought something was up. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=498.0s)]
*  On the outside of his door, there's a Hello Kitty sign. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=501.0s)]
*  I mean, it's, he seemed like a normal, friendly guy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=507.0s)]
*  There's a picture in his window. Have you seen it? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=513.0s)]
*  It's a picture of the Palestinian child who was stabbed to death. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=517.0s)]
*  And that gave me the impression that they were very, very sensitive people, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=523.0s)]
*  especially about the issue of Palestine. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=534.0s)]
*  Just hours ago, tactical teams raided the assassin's apartment. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=538.0s)]
*  And as we speak, police are coming through a manifesto [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=542.0s)]
*  he published right before the bloodshed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=545.0s)]
*  It's reportedly filled with pro-Hamas propaganda. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=547.0s)]
*  Reports say this assassin posted death to America and death to Israel. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=550.0s)]
*  He also says, I voted for Hamas. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=556.0s)]
*  Here's Pam Bondi. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=559.0s)]
*  We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=561.0s)]
*  especially tonight, our Jewish community. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=566.0s)]
*  We will follow the facts. We will follow the law. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=569.0s)]
*  And this defendant, if charged, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=572.0s)]
*  The New York Times says the FBI is still seeking a motive. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=577.0s)]
*  Motive? I think everybody knows what the motive is. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=582.0s)]
*  CNN says it's Trump's fault. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=585.0s)]
*  One of my main concerns in the current administration [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=588.0s)]
*  is the fact that so many resources are being diverted to immigration enforcement. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=592.0s)]
*  And that is a priority of this administration, and that's their prerogative. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=598.0s)]
*  But at the same time, if they are drawing down resources from counterterrorism. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=601.0s)]
*  Liberals are opening the borders and shooting Jews, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=607.0s)]
*  and CNN's blaming Trump for dropping the ball. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=611.0s)]
*  CNN called Trump Hitler, but in this case, they don't want to rush to conclusions. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=613.0s)]
*  What I saw in his eyes, I mean, I went to Columbia for grad school, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=619.0s)]
*  and I saw the same thing in his eyes as I saw in the eyes of all the protesters at Columbia. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=623.0s)]
*  Nothing different between him and them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=627.0s)]
*  But they did not create this horrific shooting. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=629.0s)]
*  They did not, you know, sort of, they didn't shoot. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=635.0s)]
*  They created, they gave permission, and they have called for this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=639.0s)]
*  They have called for Intifada revolution, which is the same thing he yelled last night. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=642.0s)]
*  Do you worry that there will be a conflation, though, of the two? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=647.0s)]
*  A conflation? I mean, they are calling for Intifada. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=652.0s)]
*  At Columbia University, they call for Intifada constantly. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=655.0s)]
*  Liberals are chanting, kill the Jews, and then someone does. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=659.0s)]
*  And CNN says one thing has nothing to do with the other. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=663.0s)]
*  Some liberal darlings in the media are giving the shooter kudos, saying the victim had it coming. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=667.0s)]
*  This guy was a monster. He was a monster. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=674.0s)]
*  He was a monster representing a foreign adversarial government currently conducting a Holocaust, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=679.0s)]
*  and they want us to feel sorry for him. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=687.0s)]
*  Even if I hadn't looked at his profile, I would have said that representatives of a general side of country [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=690.0s)]
*  should not feel safe in America, because we're supposed to stand in opposition to that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=696.0s)]
*  And now having seen it, good f***ing riddance. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=702.0s)]
*  This guy was, he was a monster. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=706.0s)]
*  This morning, Omar wouldn't even condemn the murder. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=710.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Omar, can I get your reaction to the shooting that happened in D.C. last night? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=715.0s)]
*  I'm going to go for now. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=720.0s)]
*  This is the same squad that called us dangerous. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=722.0s)]
*  Remember, Jizey Crockett said Republicans were the terrorists. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=726.0s)]
*  Y'all got the white supremacist galore, okay? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=730.0s)]
*  Like all of them. You got the proud boys. You got the neo-Nazis. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=733.0s)]
*  You have people that literally should be classified as domestic terrorists, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=738.0s)]
*  because a lot of times that is what they are doing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=743.0s)]
*  They are engaging in domestic terrorism, and guess what? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=746.0s)]
*  They all align with your side, inherently, in like who you are. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=750.0s)]
*  Y'all are violent. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=756.0s)]
*  And most of your violence has to do with people that got a little bit of melanin. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=758.0s)]
*  The right isn't burning cars and executing people in the street. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=762.0s)]
*  It's not Republicans getting tossed out of hearings, kicking and screaming for Hamas. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=766.0s)]
*  I cannot live in peace. I will not be silent. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=771.0s)]
*  What is the genocide going on? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=775.0s)]
*  Hundreds are dying every day. Hundreds. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=777.0s)]
*  I won't be silent. You can't build this genocide. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=780.0s)]
*  The world is watching. Act now. Everybody must act now. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=784.0s)]
*  Act before it's too late. They're wiping out the Palestine. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=789.0s)]
*  People, Gaza must live free Palestine. Free Gaza. We will never be silent. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=793.0s)]
*  Leftists are barricading themselves inside of college campuses and lighting their diplomas on fire. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=801.0s)]
*  We want justice to say how. We want justice to say how. We want justice to say how. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=806.0s)]
*  Burn all the diplomas now. Burn all our diplomas now. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=814.0s)]
*  We want justice to say how. We want justice to say how. Hands off our students now. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=819.0s)]
*  Democrats are losing their party. And what are they doing? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=826.0s)]
*  They're ignoring it or celebrating it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=830.0s)]
*  The president of South Africa went to the White House yesterday and got grilled about white genocide. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=833.0s)]
*  Democrats in the media thought it was only a couple of white farmers massacred. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=838.0s)]
*  It's not officially genocide until it's like, what, 10,000? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=843.0s)]
*  Is that how they feel about the Jews? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=847.0s)]
*  Reporters who said Biden's brain fog was a hoax are now saying white genocide is. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=850.0s)]
*  The president showed a video that he said showed more than a thousand burial sites of white South Africans that he said were murdered. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=856.0s)]
*  We know that that was not true. It's not true Yamiche. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=864.0s)]
*  It's not true that the video was showing a burial site. It is unsubstantiated that that's the case. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=867.0s)]
*  The video showed images of crosses in South Africa about white farmers who have been killed and politically persecuted because of the color of their skin. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=872.0s)]
*  And those crosses are representing their lives. Are you disputing that there's no. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=883.0s)]
*  I'm disputing the fact that the video showed what the president claimed it showed because it did not show that. But even more, what I'm asking you is who at the White House. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=888.0s)]
*  It did show that. It showed white crosses representing people who have perished because of racial persecution. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=894.0s)]
*  The Daily Show actually found white genocide funny. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=899.0s)]
*  President Trump's meeting with the president of South Africa today. And because it's Donald Trump, things got weird. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=902.0s)]
*  Death. Death. Death. Horrible death. Death. I don't know. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=910.0s)]
*  What a host. Death. Death. Death. Hey, do you want a Diet Coke? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=921.0s)]
*  This is the state of the Democrat Party. They have more assassins than ideas. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=929.0s)]
*  They shot Steve Scalise, got a block away from murdering Kavanaugh, shot the president. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=934.0s)]
*  Now they're blowing up homes, IVF clinics and Teslas. They're executing CEOs and Jews and having margaritas with MS 13. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=939.0s)]
*  Their donors finance it. They nurture it at universities, excuse it in the press and downplay it after the fact. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=947.0s)]
*  Their tactics are creating collateral damage in the Mideast. You think Israel is going to make peace after this? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=954.0s)]
*  You think it's easier to get Iran to sign a nuke deal after this? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=960.0s)]
*  Harvard's already lost billions and now Kristi Noem's banned the school from enrolling foreign students. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=964.0s)]
*  Left-wing violence is killing the peace process and killing the Democrat Party. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=971.0s)]
*  And notice how they're not screaming about gun control. That's how you know it's one of their own. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=976.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=990.0s)]
*  Where were you when I was 15? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=992.0s)]
*  Happy Thursday, everyone. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=995.0s)]
*  Well, it's Fleet Week here in NYC, so good luck finding a hooker. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=997.0s)]
*  Sorry, Kayleigh. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1002.0s)]
*  Some cows stranded in a Swiss village under the threat of a rock slide were airlifted to safety via helicopter. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1007.0s)]
*  It's actually the same way some New Yorkers get to work. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1015.0s)]
*  Get it out early, I say. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1020.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to get to the top of the mountain. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1023.0s)]
*  I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1028.0s)]
*  Get it out early, I say. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1033.0s)]
*  A top doctor that worked for Obama and Trump warned that Joe Biden could be dead within a year. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1036.0s)]
*  Even worse, that year was 2019. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1042.0s)]
*  According to that new Biden book, his handlers staged a town hall in a gym that went so badly, the campaign never released the footage. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1048.0s)]
*  After seeing some of the leaked tape, we can see why. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1058.0s)]
*  CNN's Paul Bacalla said the Biden cover-up won't hurt the Democrats' credibility. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1070.0s)]
*  Another cover-up that won't hurt? A bag over Paul Bacalla's face. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1075.0s)]
*  The New Jersey Health Department said that people who attended Shakira's concert at MetLife Stadium may have been exposed to measles. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1083.0s)]
*  They also added that anyone who attended a Springsteen concert may have been exposed to high levels of b****. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1090.0s)]
*  Congratulations to Jimmy Kimmel, who just became a grandfather. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1102.0s)]
*  Finally, there's someone in his family who cries more than he does. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1107.0s)]
*  James Carville said he would back AOC if she got the Democratic nomination. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1115.0s)]
*  He then let everyone know that it's 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on your car insurance. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1120.0s)]
*  And finally, porn star Bonnie Blue, most famous for having sex with over 1,000 men in 12 hours, has reportedly been arrested. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1127.0s)]
*  The charge? Violating the local occupancy limit. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1136.0s)]
*  Tragically, 16 officers were lost during her cavity search. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1140.0s)]
*  Alright. I know, it's funny. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1149.0s)]
*  Okay. So yet another tale from the new book, Original Sin. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1152.0s)]
*  Apparently, Joe Biden's campaign staff staged a fake town hall, closed to the press with an audience of loyal supporters and a comfy chair for Joe that repelled stains. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1157.0s)]
*  But apparently, Biden was so incoherent, the footage was as unusable as an ejector seat on a helicopter. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1169.0s)]
*  And so like Joe Biden's soul, the town hall never saw the light of day. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1175.0s)]
*  It's the latest story from the Tell All on Joe's Decline, written by people who helped bury it like a cat turd in a litter box. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1179.0s)]
*  But of course, the media is acting like they're the dupes. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1186.0s)]
*  This week, the Washington Post editorial board actually published this headline, quote, If Biden was too frail for his job, voters should have been informed. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1190.0s)]
*  Wow. If only, you know, there were a publication of some type that could execute that function. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1201.0s)]
*  I mean, they act like during the entire Biden presidency, they were working at Papa John's. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1207.0s)]
*  I don't know who's on that board, but they should be grateful their families didn't pull the plug during their five year coma. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1213.0s)]
*  Talk about lazy journalists. They must rotate their editors to prevent bedsores. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1219.0s)]
*  Here's a quote from the article. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1226.0s)]
*  Here's a quote from the article. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1227.0s)]
*  Well, thanks a lot, Columbo. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1244.0s)]
*  Next, you're going to tell us that Kamala likes a nightcap before breakfast. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1246.0s)]
*  And might have lacked the cognitive capacity. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1250.0s)]
*  That's like saying Dana Perina might lack the capacity to dunk. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1260.0s)]
*  But this is from the paper who claimed the evidence of Biden's mishaps were just cheap fakes. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1266.0s)]
*  I'm a thank God there was one reporter doing his job. Our stupid son of a bitch, Peter Doocy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1272.0s)]
*  President Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1277.0s)]
*  Why does White House staff treat him like a baby? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1282.0s)]
*  No one treats the president of the United States, the commander in chief, like a baby. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1285.0s)]
*  How is President Biden ever going to convince the three quarters of voters who are worried about his physical and mental health that he is OK, even though in Las Vegas he told a story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1289.0s)]
*  Am I even going to go down that rabbit hole with you, sir? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1303.0s)]
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1305.0s)]
*  My memory is so bad I can't let you speak. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1310.0s)]
*  Well, Peter fears nothing except birds. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1312.0s)]
*  Yeah, Peter, I appreciate it. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1319.0s)]
*  A bird just landed on my head! [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1321.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1324.0s)]
*  Is that a bird? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1326.0s)]
*  I did not like that at all. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1328.0s)]
*  Some advice, Peter, don't wash your hair with worm scrub. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1330.0s)]
*  But even as the media admits the cover-up was real, they do so with the caveat, hey, we swear we were we were trying to tell the truth. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1336.0s)]
*  No, they're trying to save their credibility and their careers. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1344.0s)]
*  I might trust Jake Tapper a bit more if he ever conceded a point without trying to sell me a book. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1348.0s)]
*  But how can you trust a media or a party that refuses to come clean? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1354.0s)]
*  This is a media who said Biden's babbling was a stutter when he couldn't get through a Q&A without looking DOA, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1358.0s)]
*  while simultaneously heaping hate on the citizens of this country and falsely vilifying the man they voted for to the point where he was shot. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1366.0s)]
*  Scott Adams makes this great point. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1374.0s)]
*  The gaslighting over Biden's health was justified by their gaslighting that Trump was Hitler, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1377.0s)]
*  which was entirely based on the tent pole of gaslighting the fine people hoax. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1383.0s)]
*  It's all connected. It's all deliberate. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1390.0s)]
*  And it's all false because some even defended Joe after his terrible debate. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1393.0s)]
*  Most house Dems who met with him never said a thing about his failing health. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1398.0s)]
*  So this is no longer about a party's popularity. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1402.0s)]
*  It's about credibility and trust. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1405.0s)]
*  There is no way the Dems can regain either until they own up to what they did. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1407.0s)]
*  2028 may be three plus years away, but the Biden coverup will take center stage. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1410.0s)]
*  And unless a solid Democrat emerges who exposes the secret cabal that betrayed the country, the Republicans are sitting pretty. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1416.0s)]
*  I mean, how can anybody ever trust a Democrat president if they aren't sure he's actually president? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1423.0s)]
*  He might be a front or a cutout. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1429.0s)]
*  If they take to the debate stage in 2028 with the same old act, say hello to your next president. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1431.0s)]
*  Say hello to your next president, Mr. J.D. Vance, then Rubio, then Hegseth, and of course, then Gutfeld. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1437.0s)]
*  I know, I knew that would happen. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1451.0s)]
*  I'm such a prick, Tease. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1456.0s)]
*  Or the Democrats could pull a Trump, call out their own party, and tell the truth. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1459.0s)]
*  Yeah, if my aunt had a dick, she'd be my uncle. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1465.0s)]
*  That is an old saying, but it's even funnier today because the Dems actually believe it's true. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1470.0s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1477.0s)]
*  His act was the inspiration for the sympathy card, Kimmy DeGioMacchi. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1480.0s)]
*  He once had a threesome with Mrs. Butterworth and Chef Boyardee, chef and restaurant owner Andrew Groome. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1488.0s)]
*  His voice is scratchier than Rashida Tlaib's five o'clock shadow, Jim Florentine. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1496.0s)]
*  And this guest will soon be outnumbered by her babies. Outnumbered co-host Kaylee McEnany. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1505.0s)]
*  Joe, it's good to see you. You look very suave tonight. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1516.0s)]
*  You too, Greg. Is it bowling league night? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1520.0s)]
*  Are you still doing that dinner theater based on Miami Vice? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1521.0s)]
*  Yes, Greg, and it's very popular. I actually get paid more than I do here. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1527.0s)]
*  You know, like Biden's town hall, your jokes are often unusable. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1534.0s)]
*  Do you identify with him? Do you feel any empathy? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1539.0s)]
*  I don't, Greg, because my favorite part of this story was they said it was unusable because of the lighting. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1543.0s)]
*  What was wrong with the lighting? Did it show Joe Biden too much? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1549.0s)]
*  But I'm going to go a little bit of a different direction here. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1553.0s)]
*  I don't think it's the Washington Post's fault. I don't think it's the Democrat Insider's fault. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1556.0s)]
*  I think this is the voters' fault, the people who voted for Joe Biden, because this was obvious, not the dead ones. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1561.0s)]
*  Do you remember when he couldn't remember Lloyd Austin's name? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1568.0s)]
*  Do you remember all men are created equal? You know the thing. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1573.0s)]
*  Do you remember when he was manhandled by the Easter Bunny? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1576.0s)]
*  There was a lot of signs out there that you should have picked up on at some point. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1580.0s)]
*  And the reason this frustrates me is they weren't all that nice to conservatives this last few years. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1585.0s)]
*  They were the ones who called us murderers for going to a restaurant. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1591.0s)]
*  They were the ones who said that we're going to be safer when we get rid of law and order. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1594.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to let this go. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1598.0s)]
*  So the next time I hear about a famous person with dementia, I'm going to tell them, well, I hope they're not suffering. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1600.0s)]
*  I hope they're well cared for. But most importantly, don't vote for them for president. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1604.0s)]
*  Andrew, Jeff, Joe made a very interesting point that it may not matter to voters. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1616.0s)]
*  I mean, it could be that like it doesn't matter if I'm a D, I'm going to vote D. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1625.0s)]
*  I don't care if the guy's got D as a dementia. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1630.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1632.0s)]
*  Or if the guy ends up having a debate with a French fry for 20 minutes and the media pitches it as he was talking to the French president. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1634.0s)]
*  We'll see that. You're right. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1640.0s)]
*  There's a lot of tribalism, but that's why they say it comes down to like half a million votes to really choose who the next president is. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1642.0s)]
*  And we got to target those people who actually have a brain. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1649.0s)]
*  But I don't want to take the victory lap too quickly here as we're an indulge on this buffet of truth and facts and what they're putting out there, because what they're doing right now by throwing Joe under the bus with all of these facts is they're distracting us. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1651.0s)]
*  And this is the typical playbook. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1662.0s)]
*  Right. This is just the tip of the iceberg, the top of the lasagna, whatever analogy you want to use here because they did the same thing. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1664.0s)]
*  Right. What they do is they lie. Then they pretend to tell the truth. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1670.0s)]
*  But they're lying again. And there's something underneath it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1673.0s)]
*  Newsom did it during the pandemic. Remember when he got caught dining out and he said, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1675.0s)]
*  I was I was outdoors. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1679.0s)]
*  They didn't know that Bill Mollusian had the photos of him dining. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1681.0s)]
*  And then he went up again and doubled down on the lie. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1683.0s)]
*  Right. And then just the other day, Comey did the same thing. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1686.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, eighty six, you know, forty seven. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1688.0s)]
*  I was walking along the beach and there were shells there. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1690.0s)]
*  Some kids just put it out there. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1692.0s)]
*  Right. And people eat up and believe those lies. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1694.0s)]
*  This is not necessarily a lie, but it's the same playbook. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1696.0s)]
*  So they're saying, oh, Biden did all this. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1699.0s)]
*  But really, the true story that they're trying to distract us from is what happened when he was incapacitated. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1701.0s)]
*  Right. Who was signing the checks? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1708.0s)]
*  Who was who was running the government? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1710.0s)]
*  They want to distract us from that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1712.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of the things that he did can be on and should be undone. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1714.0s)]
*  And that's the real issue. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1717.0s)]
*  You know, that young man made me change my mind on the question I was going to ask you. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1718.0s)]
*  Because I remember you are a lawyer and he's right. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1724.0s)]
*  It's like we're going to sit there and talk about his cognitive function without talking about what was being done under his name. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1727.0s)]
*  The identity theft. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1734.0s)]
*  Can anything be done? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1736.0s)]
*  Yes, something should be done. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1738.0s)]
*  I mean, I've publicly called for a special counsel. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1740.0s)]
*  I'll continue to. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1742.0s)]
*  There was a cover up and we need to get to the bottom of it because 13 people died at the Abbey Gate and I want answers. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1744.0s)]
*  What about like the auto pen? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1750.0s)]
*  Pardon. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1751.0s)]
*  The auto can they revoke that without the hearing right now? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1752.0s)]
*  Just say, look, we're going to put a stop to all this stuff. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1754.0s)]
*  That's question. You got to figure out who was running the auto pen. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1757.0s)]
*  Constitutionally, you got to litigate that up to the Supreme Court. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1759.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it was more than one person. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1763.0s)]
*  And I think I think it was Joe Biden. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1765.0s)]
*  I've got to be honest about that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1767.0s)]
*  You say who was running the country? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1769.0s)]
*  Well, I scoured this book for you, Greg, because I knew I was coming on your show. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1771.0s)]
*  I wanted to find an anecdote I could see in your memory that you could not get out. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1773.0s)]
*  And it was this in 2003. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1776.0s)]
*  Jill Biden was outside. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1778.0s)]
*  They were having a discussion about whether Joe Biden should run for president. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1780.0s)]
*  The book literally says this Alex Thompson book. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1784.0s)]
*  She walked through a planning meeting in a bathing suit with no scrawled on her stomach. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1787.0s)]
*  OK, I cannot get that out of my mind. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1791.0s)]
*  She didn't want to be in politics in 2003. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1793.0s)]
*  Then they say in 2016, she wanted to do political events. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1796.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, she was a political partner for Joe Biden to the point where in the White House, Jen Psaki sent Joe Biden out for a press conference. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1799.0s)]
*  I went two hours. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1805.0s)]
*  Jill Biden shows up and goes, where were you? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1807.0s)]
*  Why did that go on so long? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1809.0s)]
*  She's ferocious in this. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1811.0s)]
*  I can't imagine a scenario where I sent Trump out for a press conference and Melania corners me and it's like, why'd you let him do that? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1813.0s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1820.0s)]
*  That man runs the show. His name's President Trump. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1822.0s)]
*  I can tell you a likely scenario, though. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1824.0s)]
*  Jill Biden, there was a pool under the White House briefing room no longer there. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1826.0s)]
*  I could see a scenario where Peter Deuce is asking some of those questions and Jill Biden in the bathing suit with the no scrawled on her stomach. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1830.0s)]
*  No scrawled on top just tackles him. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1835.0s)]
*  I don't know why she didn't do it. It would have been more effective. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1838.0s)]
*  There's a pool under the briefing room? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1840.0s)]
*  There used to be. Not anymore. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1842.0s)]
*  I'd be a great trap door. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1844.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1846.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jim, should they revoke Dr. Jill's medical license? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1848.0s)]
*  She's definitely not a good doctor. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1852.0s)]
*  No, she's not. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1854.0s)]
*  You know, it's weird because Joe probably thought he did good in that town hall. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1856.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1861.0s)]
*  You did great. You answered all the questions. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1862.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1865.0s)]
*  That was the greatest ever. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1867.0s)]
*  You ate all the vegetables on your plate. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1869.0s)]
*  You went boo boo in your pee pee. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1871.0s)]
*  Aww. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1874.0s)]
*  I want to see that footage at a town hall, the stage town hall. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1876.0s)]
*  That's got to be out there somewhere. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1880.0s)]
*  Look, if we can see the Kardashian sex tape and we could see the Tommy Lee, that tape is out there. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1882.0s)]
*  I think you can find it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1889.0s)]
*  Yeah, and like Joe said, they blamed it on bad lighting. That's why they didn't air it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1890.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Maybe the TV people didn't know how to light a cadaver. That was the problem. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1894.0s)]
*  You know, if they wanted more lighting, Hunter should just lit up his crack pipe. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1903.0s)]
*  You know what it was? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1905.0s)]
*  Obvious. They couldn't have the lighting there because they were afraid Joe would walk toward it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1907.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1913.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1915.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1917.0s)]
*  The walking toward the light joke. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1918.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, Greg, and to your point though, when someone was using the auto pen and they weren't authorized by the president, that means they were an imposter. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1930.0s)]
*  It's no different than when I took your company credit card and ordered all that stromboli. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1932.0s)]
*  So that was you. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1935.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1937.0s)]
*  Well, you just confessed. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1939.0s)]
*  Well, I was teasing. It was for comedic effect, everyone. There's no evidence of that. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74McBrbX_m4&t=1941.0s)]
