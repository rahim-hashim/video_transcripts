# Fox News Highlights - June 19th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY)
*  Fox News alert, President Trump making it very clear that if America has to get involved [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=0.0s)]
*  in Iran, it'll end on our terms. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=4.72s)]
*  And it looks like he's preparing for any scenario. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=7.88s)]
*  The E-4B Doomsday plane just made an unexpected flight to D.C. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=11.4s)]
*  The half-billion-dollar aircraft was designed to withstand nuclear blasts and keep top government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=17.16s)]
*  officials safe when threats are off the charts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=22.8s)]
*  And it landed at Joint Base Andrews under the cover of night on Tuesday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=26.12s)]
*  Right now, the United States has two destroyers anchored in the Mediterranean, the USS Sullivan's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=30.76s)]
*  and the USS Thomas Hudner. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=36.44s)]
*  Both of these hundred-million-dollar platforms have been shooting down Iranian missiles. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=38.68s)]
*  To the south is a carrier strike group, the USS Carl Vincennes in the Arabian Sea just [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=44.28s)]
*  off the coast of Iran, flanked by four warships providing security to U.S. bases in the region. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=49.64s)]
*  And a supercarrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is on its way and should be on the scene soon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=57.08s)]
*  Dozens of F-16s have been repositioned from Italy to the Saudi Arabia base. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=63.76s)]
*  And F-22s and F-35s are on their way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=70.08s)]
*  Now, if we're going to drop bunker busters on the Iranian nuke site, it'll be done by [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=73.88s)]
*  B-2 stealth bombers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=78.32s)]
*  These aren't officially in the region, but sources tell Prime Time they've seen tactical [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=80.66s)]
*  movement in the last 24 hours. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=85.76s)]
*  This is a major moment for Trump, and he's aware that his legacy is on the line. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=88.36s)]
*  Quote, he is in his last term of his presidency. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=93.28s)]
*  He may or may not see a window to do something that is something he's always believed is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=97.0s)]
*  right and is important for the world and has the added benefit of being legacy building. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=102.4s)]
*  And this is a window. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=108.64s)]
*  It's never existed before. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  It will likely never exist again insofar as he can do anything about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=112.36s)]
*  So while he has that window, he's going to take a shot, even if it is not something that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=116.72s)]
*  everybody agrees with. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=121.88s)]
*  The president says he hasn't made up his mind and he's keeping his options open, and we [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=123.96s)]
*  believe that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=128.08s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister is flying to Switzerland for talks with the Europeans tomorrow. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=129.96s)]
*  47 is offering them one last chance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=134.88s)]
*  Regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=138.92s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision making and whether [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=147.16s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=150.04s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=155.24s)]
*  with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=165.4s)]
*  This could be Trump giving the Ayatollah a final olive branch, or it could be a pump [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=167.28s)]
*  fake and we could go in tomorrow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=172.08s)]
*  And two weeks from today is July 4th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=175.04s)]
*  Maybe Trump's planning for fireworks halfway around the world. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=177.84s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=180.56s)]
*  The CIA director told lawmakers Iran's locked and loaded and their nuke programs at the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=181.76s)]
*  goal line. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=187.08s)]
*  Quote, it's like saying a football team marched 99 yards down the field, got to the one yard [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=188.08s)]
*  line and oh, they don't have the intention to score. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=194.44s)]
*  The CIA told us things before the Iraq war that turned out not to be true. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=198.0s)]
*  The difference is this time, the inspectors have seen the program. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=202.16s)]
*  We've all seen the program and the Israelis see everything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=207.32s)]
*  There's no question the Iran nuclear program is alive and active. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  The only question is how long it will take them to nuke up when they get the go ahead. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=215.24s)]
*  Iran is the world's lead sponsor of terror and with a nuclear weapon, it could hold the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=220.76s)]
*  world hostage. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=224.76s)]
*  Not to mention they control the shipping lanes where a third of the world's oil goes through. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=226.42s)]
*  If President Trump does decide to drop bunker busters on their nuke site, we're not going [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  to sit back and let the Iranians retaliate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  So there has to be a massive air campaign that goes along with this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=240.48s)]
*  We'd have to knock out Iran's ballistic missile stockpiles and any offensive capability. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  So we're not sitting ducks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=250.32s)]
*  There's probably a rich target list that Trump would have to approve. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=252.28s)]
*  The Guardian reported Trump was getting cold feet, worried about the effectiveness of bunker [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=255.88s)]
*  busters and not willing to use tactical nukes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=261.04s)]
*  But the White House tells Fox that's not true. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=264.6s)]
*  Everything's on the table, even tactical nukes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=268.24s)]
*  The big question is if the United States does target Iran, what happens next? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=272.08s)]
*  The White House isn't considering boots on the ground. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=277.92s)]
*  Iran's three times the size of Texas and surrounded by mountains. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Invading Iran by land? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  Almost impossible. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=289.04s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=290.12s)]
*  To the west, the Zagros Mountains, a rocky wall with narrow passes, easy to defend, hard [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=291.12s)]
*  to attack. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=295.88s)]
*  To the north, the Elborz Mountains, rising like a shield beside the Caspian Sea. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=296.88s)]
*  To the east, more rugged mountains near Afghanistan and Pakistan. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=301.24s)]
*  Still no easy entry. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=304.8s)]
*  And in the middle, two deadly deserts, Dastikavir and Dastilut. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=306.12s)]
*  Scorching heat, salt flats, sand that swallows tanks, mountains, deserts, bottlenecks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=310.04s)]
*  Iran is a natural fortress, and that's why invading Iran by land is a military nightmare. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=316.64s)]
*  Iran's different than Iraq because you wouldn't have legions of foreign fighters pouring into [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=322.6s)]
*  the country to target Americans. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=327.2s)]
*  Well, because there won't be any Americans there and too, good luck getting in. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  The war's escalating quickly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=334.32s)]
*  Last night, an Iranian missile struck an Israeli hospital. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=335.88s)]
*  Israel's calling it a war crime, and its defense minister says the Ayatollah can no longer [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  continue to exist. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  Israel just destroyed a nuclear reactor which was producing plutonium. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=347.44s)]
*  And no one's coming to the Ayatollah side. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=352.0s)]
*  Hezbollah hasn't fired a single missile since the start of the campaign. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=354.88s)]
*  The Shiites haven't targeted American military bases in Iraq. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=359.28s)]
*  And the Houthis in Yemen have been quiet. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=363.56s)]
*  The Ayatollah's all alone, hiding in a bunker. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=367.12s)]
*  His nuclear scientists and generals all assassinated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  He's 86 years old. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=373.84s)]
*  He's ruled Iran with an iron fist for over three decades. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=375.44s)]
*  The man's a proud, stubborn, religious revolutionary. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=378.88s)]
*  Something tells me he's going to go down fighting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=382.92s)]
*  Now, if the United States neutralizes his nukes and his missiles, is he still able to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=385.92s)]
*  wield power? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=391.44s)]
*  The Iranian economy's a disaster. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=393.28s)]
*  He can't protect his people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  He's mistreated them for years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  So the streets will start to teeter. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  It's possible he hangs on, but a coup is likely. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  Or does Trump greenlight Israel to take him out? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=406.0s)]
*  If the Ayatollah stays in command, he will retaliate. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel will kill him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=413.08s)]
*  He will activate sleeper cells. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=414.52s)]
*  Israel's going to kill him. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=416.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=418.55999999999995s)]
*  Now, we don't know that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=419.55999999999995s)]
*  But we have to use a light touch. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=421.76s)]
*  This is delicate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=423.32s)]
*  We don't have a problem with the Iranian people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=424.88s)]
*  We have a problem with the regime. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=426.88s)]
*  An unarmed Iran that's not an arch enemy of the United States could lead to the region [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  uniting under American sponsorship and give us major leverage over the Chinese, who import [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=435.08s)]
*  almost all of their oil. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=441.08s)]
*  The risk is being too ambitious and not grounded in reality. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=443.46s)]
*  There's also a risk of doing nothing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=448.68s)]
*  There's downside to everything. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=451.32s)]
*  Sleeper cells could activate. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=453.56s)]
*  Cyber attacks, terror attacks, slippery slopes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=455.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's deliberately and carefully calibrating each of these scenarios. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=459.12s)]
*  And we elected him for moments like this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=464.88s)]
*  It all comes down to one thing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=467.8s)]
*  Trust in President Trump. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=470.68s)]
*  President Trump has incredible instincts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=472.88s)]
*  And President Trump kept America and the world safe in his first term as president [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=475.06s)]
*  in implementing a peace through strength foreign policy agenda. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=480.34s)]
*  And with respect to Iran, nobody should be surprised by the president's position that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=484.62s)]
*  Iran absolutely cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=489.3s)]
*  He's been unequivocally clear about this for decades, not just as president, not just as [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=492.78s)]
*  a presidential candidate, but also as a private citizen. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=496.86s)]
*  Let's take a moment to look at the facts as they stand right now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=500.66s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=504.18s)]
*  Israel, they control the skies over Iran and are hitting one military target after another. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=505.46s)]
*  They are hitting their nuclear facilities. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=511.1s)]
*  They've taken out their nuclear scientists. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=512.94s)]
*  They've taken out their top military personnel. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=514.98s)]
*  They are pounding them around the clock every day, every night. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=517.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, Iran is getting desperate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=520.46s)]
*  They're launching missiles now at civilian areas in Israel. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=522.7s)]
*  Worse than ever, as today they struck a hospital. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=526.98s)]
*  It doesn't get any lower than that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=529.86s)]
*  But these attacks are weakening. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=531.84s)]
*  They're getting more disorganized as Israel now is hunting down, eliminating Iran's missile [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=533.66s)]
*  launchers and they're doing so successfully. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=539.62s)]
*  Also indications tonight that Iranians may be running out of missiles and the batteries [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=542.98s)]
*  to launch them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=548.28s)]
*  And as Jennifer Griffin just reported, there is a massive U.S. military buildup in the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=549.62s)]
*  region. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=553.9s)]
*  American bombers now lining up at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, F-22 stealth fighter [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  in route to the Middle East and numerous other military and naval assets have been in the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=561.6999999999999s)]
*  area for weeks. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=566.46s)]
*  One thing seems pretty certain tonight and that is that the Iranian, quote, Republic [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=568.18s)]
*  will not have a nuclear program at the end of this conflict and Israel may or may not [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=574.34s)]
*  need our help taking out Iran's top secret, you know, Fodeu, Fodeu rather, nuclear facility [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=580.22s)]
*  deep inside under that mountain. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=587.22s)]
*  We have the bunker buster bombs that can do it, as we reported, and the stealth two [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=589.26s)]
*  bombers that can drop the massive payload without being detected over the skies in Iran. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=593.74s)]
*  Every military operation, we always pause. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=599.6s)]
*  It does have danger. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=602.5s)]
*  There's always danger when there's any military conflict. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=604.46s)]
*  Not the first choice, but they are the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=608.66s)]
*  They have killed Americans. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=612.48s)]
*  We'll get into more details in a minute. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=613.92s)]
*  Now it would be by far the best, most efficient way, meaning the bunker busters to take out [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=616.02s)]
*  this site, this remaining site at Fodeu. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  But in the end, I suspect it will be gone one way or the other. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=624.28s)]
*  And tonight, somewhat surprisingly, President Trump is still working on a more peaceful [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=627.96s)]
*  solution. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=632.46s)]
*  According to reports tonight from the White House, there is a, quote, substantial chance [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=633.46s)]
*  for a diplomatic solution. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=637.76s)]
*  Now keep in mind, Iran has zero leverage at this moment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=639.74s)]
*  They have in many ways already lost the conflict. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=644.04s)]
*  They have no control of the skies of their own country. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=647.0s)]
*  And as the president said, unconditional surrender and no weapons moving forward, that's got [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=650.92s)]
*  to be part of any deal, and that deal has to be made expeditiously. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=657.0999999999999s)]
*  While this would be the ideal solution, I'm not exactly sure they even know what the word [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  peace means, and the world knows that the Iranians cannot be trusted. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  Any signed agreement would need to include the immediate access and dismantlement of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=671.88s)]
*  their entire nuclear program. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=676.78s)]
*  Understand, they have no leverage at this moment. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=679.08s)]
*  And that would include, by the way, the Fodeu site, and that has to be led by an American [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=682.2s)]
*  team of scientists, also including anywhere, any place, any time inspections. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=687.02s)]
*  Anything less than that would frankly be meaningless, and we'd be back to square one. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=692.58s)]
*  Now, if they agree to the most aggressive conditions, and I would add to that, they've [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=696.96s)]
*  got to give up their long-range missiles and any missile that would be in range of any [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=702.12s)]
*  installation that America has in the entire region. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  I guess if they could do that, their back is against the wall, but I would never trust [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=711.24s)]
*  these radical terrorists and extremists. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=715.7s)]
*  They are now desperate. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  They are running out of time. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, regarding the ongoing situation in Iran. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=722.76s)]
*  I know there has been a lot of speculation amongst all of you in the media regarding [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=726.24s)]
*  the president's decision-making and whether or not the United States will be directly [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=729.8s)]
*  involved. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=734.8399999999999s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=740.0s)]
*  with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=744.86s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=750.18s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=751.8s)]
*  All right, we can interpret within two weeks. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=755.52s)]
*  That could be hours from now. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=757.64s)]
*  Could be two weeks from now. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=759.02s)]
*  As always, President Trump is not going to forecast the plan to the enemy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=760.88s)]
*  So if I were the mullahs of Iran tonight, I would act fast because here's another simple [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=765.0s)]
*  fact that they need to comprehend and understand very deeply. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=770.0s)]
*  You can call it the Trump doctrine. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=773.92s)]
*  You can call it whatever the hell you want. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=775.72s)]
*  Well, the president rightfully hates war. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=777.64s)]
*  He does. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=780.48s)]
*  He prefers peace. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=781.48s)]
*  He gave them 60 days, and he has done everything he can do to avoid war. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=783.24s)]
*  He also has a backbone, and he's no isolationist, and he's proven that in the past. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=788.84s)]
*  A president who took down ISIS, al-Baghdadi and his associates in his very first year [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=794.16s)]
*  without getting the United States into one of those long protracted wars that everybody [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=800.08s)]
*  keeps talking about. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=804.72s)]
*  It's a president that took out the number one terrorist of Iran, and that would be General [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=806.24s)]
*  Soleimani sending a very clear message. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=810.04s)]
*  Again, without any protracted conflict. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=813.2s)]
*  It's also a president that used the mother of all bombs to take out the entire terrorist [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=815.84s)]
*  encampment in Afghanistan. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=821.1600000000001s)]
*  Do we forget that part? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  The president has stated many times over and over again, Iran, he's been clear, there's [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=824.2800000000001s)]
*  no ambiguity here. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=829.62s)]
*  Iran cannot have nuclear weapons, and that is the correct policy, or the world would [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=831.72s)]
*  risk a potential modern-day Holocaust, and that is not hyperbole. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=837.12s)]
*  Look at the hundreds of thousands of rockets over the decades that Iran or their proxies [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=842.42s)]
*  have fired into Israel, and how many Americans have they also killed over the years? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=847.78s)]
*  It simply cannot happen. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=853.14s)]
*  They have been at war with us since 1979, 444 days, Americans held hostage. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=855.3399999999999s)]
*  They threatened to nuke the United States almost every year. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=863.04s)]
*  Now when someone tells you who they are and what they plan to do, I would believe them, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=867.0999999999999s)]
*  especially with their history of fomenting terrorism worldwide. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=871.94s)]
*  This is something America learned the hard way. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  After 9-11, remember the 9-11 Commission report, they were at war with us, we were not at war [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=879.1s)]
*  with them. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=885.08s)]
*  Put simply, we cannot sleepwalk into a nuclear-armed Iran, the world, America, Israel, the entire [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=886.08s)]
*  region will be held hostage. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=893.5600000000001s)]
*  Now if there is a solution tonight that is emerging that can keep us out of this conflict [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=895.62s)]
*  with all of the things that I mentioned in terms of any place, anywhere, anytime inspections, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=900.92s)]
*  if they will give up their long and short range missiles, if they will give up their [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=906.66s)]
*  missile batteries, if they will allow American inspectors and scientists to dismantle the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=910.22s)]
*  Fordow site, great, I am open to peace. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=915.96s)]
*  And President Trump is clear, he won't hesitate to act in the end because unlike Obama and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=919.84s)]
*  unlike Biden, I believe President Trump, through the ways I have mentioned, will always put [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=924.4s)]
*  the interests and security of you, the American people, first. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=929.52s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=933.04s)]

*  living in Iran. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1013.0s)]
*  Well in that case, lady, from now on, please cover your face. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1015.44s)]
*  Monica Lewinsky is now claiming Bill Clinton should have resigned and she should never [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1022.76s)]
*  have been put in that position. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1027.4s)]
*  I assume she meant kneeling. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1033.24s)]
*  A record setting heat wave is hitting NYC. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1037.96s)]
*  It's so hot the Statue of Liberty is wearing a thong. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1041.04s)]
*  So hot they're filling the potholes in Times Square with gazpacho. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  It's so hot that AOC is going to change her name to AC. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1050.44s)]
*  Federal authorities are investigating a large number of unsolicited pizza deliveries to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1058.4s)]
*  the homes of Congressional lawmakers. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1063.04s)]
*  And when you find these pranksters, please give them my address, said one man. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  And finally, a new study suggests cognitive function can be impaired directly after watching [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  porn. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1079.68s)]
*  I didn't know Kamala had a sex addiction. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1081.84s)]
*  Call me Kamala. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  This week, the Washington Post ran a fluff bomb celebrating centrist Democrat women going [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1088.88s)]
*  gaga over their resumes, mom energy, and group chat chemistry. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1096.04s)]
*  But in this journalistic stroke job, not a single policy position was mentioned, which [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1101.24s)]
*  is weird. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1106.24s)]
*  That's like doing a profile on me and not mentioning my many bodybuilding awards. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1107.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1112.4s)]
*  So why is that? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1114.4s)]
*  Have they been so far backward to avoid a basic stance? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1115.4s)]
*  Maybe because in the current state of their party, it's better just to keep your head [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1119.24s)]
*  down and to stay safe. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1122.68s)]
*  They substitute substance with nicknames, the Mod Squad or the Badass Caucus. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1125.48s)]
*  But it's fake empowerment meant to disguise a lack of bravery. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1131.48s)]
*  But what are they scared of? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1136.16s)]
*  What's the dog not barking? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1137.2800000000002s)]
*  The key question to detect a centrist is, do males belong in women's sports? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1139.52s)]
*  Of course, we all know the answer to that. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1145.24s)]
*  It's yes. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1147.68s)]
*  Someone has to show them how to hold a bat. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1149.04s)]
*  A sexist would say. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1151.2s)]
*  But how does a liberal woman answer that question? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1156.68s)]
*  Say yes and forget winning back men with daughters and sensible women will follow them out of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1159.28s)]
*  the door too. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1163.8s)]
*  But answer no and you become a target for the crazies running your party. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  So suddenly these champions of the fairer sex go from wonder women to wondering if women [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1169.44s)]
*  can have a nutsack and a beard. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1174.34s)]
*  Instead of bravery, they choose passivity, putting their political agendas in airplane [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1178.4599999999998s)]
*  mode. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1184.5s)]
*  No signals in or out. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1185.5s)]
*  Now what about us? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1187.74s)]
*  Well, after the last five years, we've developed an allergy to compulsory thinking. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1188.74s)]
*  You can't tell us what to believe and you can't tell us we lack empathy if we don't. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1193.62s)]
*  But the Democrat Party is different. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1198.26s)]
*  It's a collection of appeasement signals where one group must submit to the other and by [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1200.32s)]
*  avoiding confrontation, they hope they will be eaten last. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1205.36s)]
*  It's why the loudest members of the party are usually white women. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1209.36s)]
*  It's an appeasement signal. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  They wish to pass inspection by dramatically applauding extremes to avoid being targeted [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1214.08s)]
*  for their whiteness. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1220.24s)]
*  It's just like kneeling in those post Floyd photo ops, a collective action of masochism [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1221.8999999999999s)]
*  masquerading as virtue. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1226.6s)]
*  Women's bowed, cops hugged rioters and CVS set new speed records installing plywood. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1229.12s)]
*  But that wasn't empathy, it was submission. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1235.52s)]
*  And that cracking sound you heard, it wasn't gunfire. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1237.9199999999998s)]
*  It was Chuck and Nancy's knees when they tried to stand back up. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1240.82s)]
*  Fast forward to today, the same instinct is hijacking women's compassion. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  Girls get concussed by male athletes, kids are nudged towards puberty blockers and irreversible [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1251.86s)]
*  surgeries are disguised as gender affirmation. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1257.6399999999999s)]
*  Centrists call it a complex issue. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1261.4399999999998s)]
*  It's not, nor is it empathy to agree with whoever shouts loudest. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1263.28s)]
*  True empathy protects the vulnerable like the girls injured on playing fields or confused [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1267.7199999999998s)]
*  12 year olds operated on and scarred for life. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  J.K. Rowling figured that out and refused to bend. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1275.08s)]
*  The result, true, the creator of Harry Potter got death threats from dudes in dresses waving [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  their own magic wands. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1283.24s)]
*  But she's also the bravest woman on earth. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1286.24s)]
*  But that could be you, Democrat ladies, if you trade passivity for principle. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1289.08s)]
*  So here's a three word test before anyone gets to wear the centrist sash. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1295.08s)]
*  Define a woman. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1300.48s)]
*  It's a three word answer, not a man. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1301.52s)]
*  Pass that quiz and you may proceed to taxes, China and potholes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1304.28s)]
*  Because if you can't handle biology, why should we trust you with anything else? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1309.16s)]
*  It's no wonder the DNC is so broke it's ready to post feet pics on OnlyFans. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1312.88s)]
*  Because donors are avoiding them like Hunter Biden avoids child support. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1319.5600000000002s)]
*  But shouldn't there be all sorts of centrist lining up to donate? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1325.24s)]
*  Nope, because voters smell cowardice the way the view picks up the scent of a nearby catering [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1328.92s)]
*  truck. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1334.44s)]
*  So dem centrist, why not plant your flag on the simplest hill? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, enjoy your shrinking group chat because real women have left the conversation. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1342.8s)]
*  Let's welcome, China's Giz. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1348.1599999999999s)]

*  You as well. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  Dressed quite suavely in the black shirt and blue sport coat. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  I feel like I'm overdressed. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1407.8000000000002s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1408.8000000000002s)]
*  You're like, ban a check. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1410.2800000000002s)]
*  Why do you think they didn't mention issues in that article? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1413.2800000000002s)]
*  It seems like I normally don't read, but I'm going like, okay, it'll be the next paragraph. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  But you never find out what they're centrist on. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1420.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because if you had an opinion, you can get attacked and you will get attacked. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1422.8000000000002s)]
*  And so they're trying to figure out how you thread the needle without getting attacked, which is impossible. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1426.12s)]
*  But you pointed to something really interesting. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1431.12s)]
*  You talked about their overwhelming need to be empathic. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1433.12s)]
*  This is toxic empathy. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1436.12s)]
*  Greg, if I treated a drug addict and I said, oh, you want to do drugs? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1438.12s)]

*  Here, here's your heroin. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1445.12s)]
*  That is how you kill people. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1446.12s)]
*  That is toxic empathy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1448.12s)]
*  They are doing that, by the way, in cities. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1449.12s)]
*  I know these teams that come to murder. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1452.12s)]
*  I give them the needles because that makes them feel good. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1454.4399999999998s)]
*  It's because I'm so concerned for you. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1457.4399999999998s)]

*  That literally is negligent manslaughter. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1465.4399999999998s)]
*  It's that's what that is. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1468.4399999999998s)]
*  And until we hold them accountable, they're going to continue killing people. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1470.4399999999998s)]
*  Six a day down the street of Los Angeles. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1473.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Why? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1475.4399999999998s)]
*  Because we're not allowed to treat them. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1476.4399999999998s)]
*  And they give them their rigs and they give their drugs. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1478.4399999999998s)]
*  They miss the fact that it's progressive in all situations. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1480.4399999999998s)]
*  The fact that you have a nurse come and administer the drug is still a progression. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1483.76s)]
*  And with opiates, it progresses to death. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1486.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1489.76s)]
*  Wow, we went off topic there, Michael. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1490.76s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1492.76s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1493.76s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1494.76s)]
*  It is interesting. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1495.76s)]
*  I learned the word awfuls from you, affluent white female liberals. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1496.76s)]
*  Do you think it's weird that the passivity in people often cause them to react the loudest? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1499.76s)]
*  Well, sure, because I think the squeaky wheel gets the grease so they want to get attention that way. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1508.76s)]
*  Looking at these broads, maybe they're called centrist because each one of them is a five. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1513.08s)]
*  And I mean like that's terrible. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1516.08s)]
*  And I mean at least a six, Michael. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1522.08s)]
*  And I mean like a Milwaukee five. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1524.08s)]
*  Maybe the one on the right is a six, but the one on the left, I mean, I know what that side part's hiding, but it can't be good. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1526.08s)]
*  But I think they're being very smart because am I wrong? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1532.08s)]
*  I think they're being very smart because if you don't have the votes in the House or the Senate or the Supreme Court in the White House, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1537.3999999999999s)]
*  what is the point of taking a stand on every single issue if you're not going to be able to deliver? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  You're just going to demonstrate your impotence. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's much smarter for them to watch for the Republicans to implode or have infighting. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  And then a month before the election, then you take your issues. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  It happened in 1994, the Contract for America that Gingrich put forward. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1557.3999999999999s)]
*  That was like a month before the election and the gangbusters for the Republicans. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  So wait and see. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1563.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the smart move. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1564.3999999999999s)]
*  So don't do anything. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  Don't say anything. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1566.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1567.72s)]
*  And let them have a circular firing squad on the other side. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1568.72s)]
*  It's always so uplifting to hear from Michael. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1569.72s)]
*  And by the way, have you notified ICE? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1575.72s)]
*  He's just mad because I called him a four. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1578.72s)]
*  Kat, why do you think they're not getting the big donations? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1584.72s)]
*  I don't know why they would be getting any donations. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1590.72s)]
*  Imagine having donated to the Democratic Party and just seeing how that election went. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1593.04s)]
*  They were completely off base on the public's opinion on many major issues and they lost [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1600.04s)]
*  badly. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1606.04s)]
*  But then also as things were coming out about what they spent the money on. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1607.04s)]
*  I have not forgotten that they spent six figures on a new set for Kamala to do the Call Her [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1611.04s)]
*  Daddy podcast. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1617.04s)]
*  They're struggling with the huge drop in donations and they still gave a raise to the party's [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1621.16s)]
*  leader. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1625.16s)]
*  That's true. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1626.16s)]
*  It's not just that it was bad, it's that they're still doing so badly. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1627.16s)]
*  And I did see one sort of stance that they actually took in that article, which was, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1629.16s)]
*  we're not socialist. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1634.16s)]
*  Or no, we're not saying socialist. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1636.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1639.16s)]
*  The fact that that feels like a bold move really proves how much further they have to [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1640.16s)]
*  go, I think, before they're going to have any donations coming in. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1647.16s)]
*  I feel like they need to call it, in the party they have to either get rid of the intolerant [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1650.88s)]
*  thinkers or call a truce so people can actually express their beliefs. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1656.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually glad there's a doctor here tonight because I'm experiencing, one of the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1661.88s)]
*  things that he hit on, he said impotence. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1666.3600000000001s)]
*  I just can't get up for the story. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1668.0400000000002s)]
*  Something about this story, the blood just doesn't flow. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm trying, I'm staring at the pictures. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1674.76s)]
*  It's just, nothing's happening. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1678.32s)]
*  Clearly it's not them, it must be me. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  But when you are a group of, well, they don't even have cats in the picture with them because [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1685.64s)]
*  the cats are like, f*** no. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1692.76s)]
*  This is what happens when the party's over, the lights are on, and now the side part makes [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  so much more sense. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1703.44s)]
*  They have no stars, they have no truth, they have nothing that you will fall behind because [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1706.14s)]
*  you can be less attractive and be funny. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1710.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1715.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1716.6200000000001s)]
*  And because of your wittiness, you forego that actually, well, the two of them are kind [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  of trollish. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1724.3400000000001s)]
*  Like usually one would need a bridge and a big goat to knock them off so you could get [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1725.3400000000001s)]
*  across to school. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1731.76s)]
*  But because they're entertaining, you're like, you know what, we can let the troll s*** go. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1733.08s)]
*  It's terrible to look at, it's worse to think about, and even horrible to listen to. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1737.84s)]
*  So across the board, they're just unattractive. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1742.36s)]
*  And you're saying that in the holistic sense. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1746.76s)]
*  No, those, I'm saying in general, from top to bottom, from man buns to Birkenstock to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1748.76s)]
*  pierced nose to blue hair, get a makeover. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1755.0s)]
*  I agree with, I agree with. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1759.1999999999998s)]
*  I agree with every single word that Shrek just said. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1764.08s)]
*  See, and this is why. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1770.08s)]
*  Shrek lives through all the sequels. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1774.08s)]
*  Your character won't make it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZgScctszY&t=1775.84s)]
