# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 20, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE)
*  Now, for years we've watched as venal forces, I want to put venal and bold face and italics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=0.0s)]
*  because it's truly venal, venal forces lined up against Donald Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  They punished him with impeachments, sham civil suits, baseless indictments, all politically [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  motivated, and it was all because he wouldn't play nice with the swamp. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=16.94s)]
*  All he wanted to do was make America great again, but that in and of itself, that was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=22.18s)]
*  a threat to the gang that likes to run Washington without accountability. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=27.76s)]
*  But Trump's not the only one being pummeled for daring to stand up for the voiceless because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  a similar dynamic is at play in New York City at the trial of Daniel Penny, an American [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  who refused to sit back and do nothing when others were threatened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=43.72s)]
*  Remember last May we covered it at the time, Penny saw Jordan Neely on the subway and witnesses [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=48.28s)]
*  say Neely was screaming like a maniac at other passengers, actually threatening to kill the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=53.72s)]
*  other passengers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=60.2s)]
*  Now, Penny didn't wait for someone to get hurt. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=61.36s)]
*  He sprung into action, tackling Neely and restraining him until police got there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=64.52s)]
*  Neely went unconscious and later died. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=70.44s)]
*  The NYPD hauled Penny in for questioning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=73.56s)]
*  Some guy came in and he's like, with his jacket off and he's like, I'm going to kill everybody. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=76.16s)]
*  I'm going to go to prison forever. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=82.2s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=86.0s)]
*  I don't do this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=87.0s)]
*  At that point, I looked to the person next to me like, hey, just hang on to this phone [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=88.0s)]
*  for me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=90.64s)]
*  I had my headphones in and took it off and just kind of like grabbed him from behind [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=91.64s)]
*  because he came in just to like, because he was acting like a lunatic, like a crazy person. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=94.56s)]
*  So and he was rolling around the floor. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=100.36s)]
*  And at that point the train stopped. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  I was like, someone call the cops. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=104.56s)]
*  And he's still like rolling around. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=105.72s)]
*  So going crazy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=107.0s)]
*  I had two other guys kind of help me just kind of keep them from going nuts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=108.0s)]
*  You notice who wasn't sitting next to Penny in that room? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=112.2s)]
*  I don't believe unless I'm missing something. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=116.64s)]
*  A lawyer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=118.84s)]
*  Why did he think he needed a lawyer, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=119.84s)]
*  But now we see the line of questioning shows that they were after something else, proof [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  that this good Samaritan was guilty of a crime. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=128.56s)]
*  I'm not a confrontational guy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=131.52s)]
*  I'm not out here trying to attack people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=133.6s)]
*  But he was making enough of a scene that you noticed him and you probably wouldn't notice [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=138.04s)]
*  if you put his hands on someone. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  But I didn't. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he waived his right to counsel because he just only protected people on the subway. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  But of course, Democrats will almost always side with thugs against patriots, as some [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=152.44s)]
*  did in this case. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=159.92s)]
*  No one should really be strangled to death for acting up on a subway or performing on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=162.16s)]
*  a subway. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=167.92s)]
*  We see a black homeless person who is scary because that person's hungry and thirsty. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=168.92s)]
*  And it's okay to dehumanize the person who's in need of help or who's simply trying to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=177.8s)]
*  protect themselves. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=183.8s)]
*  I also find it very strange that people will come to the aid of an accused rather than [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=185.44s)]
*  come to the support of the judicial system. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay, I don't even know what that means. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=196.08s)]
*  But what if their son or daughter or wife had been on that subway car? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=199.0s)]
*  Do they not care about how regular people feel threatened every day of the week in these [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=208.24s)]
*  cities? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, I know congressmen, most at least, have security. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=214.28s)]
*  But most regular people, they don't have security. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Regular everyday people need to be safe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=221.6s)]
*  If they're harassing people who are vulnerable and nobody gets involved, it could create [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  a dangerous situation for a lot of people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=229.16s)]
*  The MTA should be concerned about the issues that are happening once they're on board of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  their train and their service. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=235.12s)]
*  So possibly look into having some sort of added security. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=240.88s)]
*  Why are we not prosecuting some of these guys or getting them off the streets or going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=241.88s)]
*  to fight if they need mental help, you know, get some help for them? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=246.56s)]
*  No, because we're prosecuting the people who stood up to fight the people who are threatening [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  other Americans. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=254.44s)]
*  And of course, Alvin Bragg, D.A. Alvin Bragg, as he did with Trump, ignored the evidence [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=255.44s)]
*  and he goes forward and he charges Daniel Penny with second degree manslaughter and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=261.28s)]
*  criminally negligent homicide. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=265.88s)]
*  As this trial plays out, it becomes more apparent how ludicrous these charges are. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=269.12s)]
*  Almost all of the other passengers, when they were interviewed, recalled how Neely had menacingly [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=273.0s)]
*  approached and yelling about being hungry and wanting to go back to jail. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=279.48s)]
*  One witness testified that she was filled with a sense of relief when Daniel Penny took [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=285.04s)]
*  Neely to the ground saying, this was the first time in my life where I took a moment because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=289.36s)]
*  I thought I was going to die. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=296.04s)]
*  And all the evidence suggests that Neely was mentally unstable. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=299.12s)]
*  Dr. Alexander Bradley, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, testified that Neely had [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  mental health breakdowns, including delusions that the rapper Tupac Shakur was using him [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=308.06s)]
*  to change the world and that he heard the devil's voice. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  Neely's toxicology report also found synthetic marijuana in his system. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=317.0s)]
*  This is where Alvin Bragg's focus is, prosecuting a brave man who risked his own life for others. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, when you think about it, how bad things are in the New York subway right [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=331.12s)]
*  now, it's like a shining light in this crumbling crime-ridden subway system. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=334.4s)]
*  And when he's not targeting the city's heroes for prosecution, Alvin Bragg is trying to, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=342.48s)]
*  of course, imprison President Trump. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=346.44s)]
*  In regards to the president-elect Trump sentencing, do you want a sentence to be rendered before [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=348.92s)]
*  inauguration or would you rather it come after his term? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=354.0s)]
*  We have significant competing constitutional issues, the office of the presidency and all [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=357.64s)]
*  the obligations that come with that on the one hand, and on the other hand, the sanctity [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  of a jury voice, a jury that has spoken and rendered a guilty verdict. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=370.44s)]
*  When any of you out there think law school and passing the bar is difficult, remember [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=377.4s)]
*  Alvin Bragg did both. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=380.56s)]
*  So when he continues to funnel the city's resources into these baseless prosecutions, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=383.2s)]
*  the real violent criminals are still roaming about the streets terrorizing people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Just this week, three were killed during a random stabbing spree. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  The suspect, 51-year-old Ramon Rivera, has an extensive rap sheet spanning three states. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=400.35999999999996s)]
*  And Gary Worthy, a convicted felon with 17 priors, get this, only including murder, is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=407.12s)]
*  accused of holding up two local businesses before reportedly shooting NYPD officer Rich [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=414.2s)]
*  Wong and an innocent bystander. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=419.96s)]
*  Officer Wong fired back, killing Worthy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=422.04s)]
*  These stories, stories like this, part of the reason why Trump made gains in certain [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=426.76s)]
*  parts of these blue cities. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=432.44s)]
*  Manhattan seems to be lost, still lost, but the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, obviously [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=434.48s)]
*  already know about that, but it made huge gains. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=440.04s)]
*  And people are just, have had enough. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=442.88s)]
*  This is just warped, a warped version of justice. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  And where the heroes are prosecuted and the villains set free. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=448.88s)]
*  But this just in, Ellen DeGeneres has flown the coop. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=454.36s)]
*  Ellen and her wife, Portia, have decided to quote, get the hell out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=457.36s)]
*  So they bought a castle in England. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=461.6s)]
*  They don't have to watch Trump on TV anymore. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=463.72s)]
*  They just have to watch Piers Morgan. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  So for Democrats that can't afford English castles, what's next? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=469.48s)]
*  The majority of the country thinks they're crazy, you know, with the DEI, sex changes [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=474.24s)]
*  for illegals and defund the police stuff. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=477.98s)]
*  It took Democrats decades to build a good reputation and just four years to ruin it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's the new normal. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  He's popular and his transition is getting high marks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=488.42s)]
*  And the media is getting ready for Joe to go. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=491.98s)]

*  But Trump isn't traveling alone. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1451.0s)]
*  The world seems to be along for the ride. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1452.64s)]
*  It's funny, just a few weeks ago, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1454.52s)]
*  Trump was a threat to world peace. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1455.76s)]
*  When the only threat we really faced [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  was Joe Biden mistaking our children for dinner. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1459.0800000000002s)]
*  But now foreign leaders are suddenly making nice. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1462.52s)]
*  Australia's ambassador to America [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1465.5600000000002s)]
*  had previously called Trump [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1467.3200000000002s)]
*  the most destructive president in history. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1468.44s)]
*  But now he's congratulating him [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1471.5s)]
*  and looking forward to working closely with Trump. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1472.84s)]
*  No wonder the Aussies invented the boomerang. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1475.28s)]
*  Up in Canada, their first trans prime minister, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1478.3s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1481.12s)]
*  suddenly cracking down on unchecked immigration. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1482.36s)]
*  He was talking tough there for a while [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1485.6s)]
*  until somebody showed him this picture. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1487.76s)]
*  Now... [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1492.8s)]
*  Now... [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1493.6399999999999s)]
*  Now... [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1494.48s)]

*  Now... [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1499.48s)]
*  Trudeau so scared he started wearing white face. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1500.32s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1506.0s)]
*  Down in Mexico, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1506.84s)]
*  Lefty President Claudia Scheinbaum [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1507.76s)]
*  wouldn't even acknowledge Trump's candidacy [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1509.76s)]
*  on election day. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1511.76s)]
*  Scheinbaum, Mexico has a Jewish president. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1513.08s)]
*  Maybe she'll agree to Trump building a wailing wall. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1517.36s)]
*  You know, that joke doesn't deserve you. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1523.58s)]
*  Then Trump said he would make the public, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1527.72s)]
*  the intelligence that America had [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1530.64s)]
*  on Mexican politicians in bed with cartels. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1532.44s)]
*  Suddenly Scheinbaum's cracking down on her own border now. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1535.04s)]
*  But soon Claudia might be welcoming 10 million people [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  who should look familiar. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1541.8s)]
*  Get ready for an influx of gang bangers, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1543.56s)]
*  drug dealers, and even worse, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1545.6000000000001s)]
*  washed up celebs. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1547.32s)]
*  So Trump... [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1551.3600000000001s)]
*  Trump's triggering lefty foreign leaders [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1554.8400000000001s)]
*  like a quarter pounder at a PETA rally. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1557.04s)]
*  But is it all on Trump? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1559.92s)]
*  As he himself has said, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  they haven't been after him, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1563.4s)]
*  they've been after you, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1565.0800000000002s)]
*  and he's just in the way. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1566.28s)]
*  And the truth is, it's you who's had enough [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1568.04s)]
*  if you just took Trump to make it clear. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1570.64s)]
*  The world gets it. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1573.04s)]
*  Daddy's home and it's time to clean up your mess. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1573.92s)]
*  And you can't hide behind a legacy media, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1576.44s)]
*  which is deader than the battery [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1578.64s)]
*  in Rosie O'Donnell's back trimmer. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1580.04s)]
*  But really, the world wants this. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1583.52s)]
*  The world wants this. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1587.8000000000002s)]
*  They just needed someone to rip the Band-Aid off. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1588.68s)]
*  It wasn't gonna be Joe or Kamala. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1592.0s)]
*  Joe lacks the upper body strength [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1593.5600000000002s)]
*  and Kamala doesn't have enough accents [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1595.16s)]
*  to please the whole world. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1596.8400000000001s)]
*  But everyone knew the planet was screwed. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1599.3600000000001s)]
*  Hell, even the bad guys are now picking up their toys [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1601.68s)]
*  and crawling back under their rocks. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1604.5600000000002s)]
*  Qatar has just confirmed that Hamas leaders [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  are no longer there. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1608.68s)]
*  Maybe they're hiding somewhere safe. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1610.3600000000001s)]
*  Perhaps in Rashida Tlaib's mustache. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1612.64s)]
*  The truth is, for things to operate in the world, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1615.48s)]
*  someone has to stand up once in a while [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1619.48s)]
*  and say, wrap it up, guys. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1621.48s)]
*  This is enough. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  That guy's Trump. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1624.48s)]
*  But he's got all of us, too. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1625.7600000000002s)]
*  No wonder the world's scared. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1627.7600000000002s)]
*  Might be the one thing they've ever gotten right. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1629.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdR-7--dEIE&t=1644.88s)]
