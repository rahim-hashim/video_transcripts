# Fox News Highlights - March 24, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw)
*  Then to today, when the reception Trump received through his lawyers wasn't an embrace, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=0.0s)]
*  was a rebuff. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=5.36s)]
*  Judges in three different jurisdictions trying to rein in the sitting president, who was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  elected to make good on a clear set of campaign promises. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=11.3s)]
*  The rogue resistance is real. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=15.42s)]
*  The myriad lawsuits against the Trump administration have one aim, to make it impossible for him [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=18.1s)]
*  to implement key parts of his agenda. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=24.36s)]
*  Now they aim to drown him and the DOJ in a nonstop wave of litigation, challenging everything [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=27.38s)]
*  from his move to separate transgendered troops from military service, to shrinking the federal [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=34.46s)]
*  workforce, to deporting the most dangerous illegal aliens imaginable. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=39.82s)]
*  Now the idea that any plaintiff withstanding can forum shop for the most liberal jurisdiction, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=45.42s)]
*  then one judge in that district can stop the president's policies? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  It's obscene. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=57.02s)]
*  First, Judge James Boesberg in DC denied the Trump team's petition to vacate his earlier [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=58.02s)]
*  rulings that put a temporary hold on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=65.02000000000001s)]
*  Boesberg ruled that while the government doesn't have to release any potential deportees in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=71.42s)]
*  custody going forward without conceding the harm that these most of these vicious foreign [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=75.7s)]
*  criminals had done to their innocent victims, Boesberg lamented the living conditions in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=82.52s)]
*  the Salvador prison. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  Then in the DC District Court of Appeals today at an oral argument challenging Boesberg's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=89.44s)]
*  initial hold on the deportations, Obama nominee Judge Patricia Millett made her own political [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  speech with words chosen that would of course guarantee her national media coverage. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=101.0s)]
*  There were plain loads of people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=106.44s)]
*  There were no procedures in place to notify people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=109.52s)]
*  Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act and it's happened here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=114.72s)]
*  Nazis, of course. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=118.92s)]
*  They're back to Nazis. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=121.16s)]
*  And then in another court, the commander in chief was blocked again in a case involving [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  transgender airmen challenging Trump's executive orders proclaiming, guess what, controversial, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=126.84s)]
*  they're only two sexes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  And the other one barring openly transgender military personnel from serving in the military. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=133.92s)]
*  Now, U.S. District Judge Christine O'Hern, another Biden appointee in this case, ruled [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=139.56s)]
*  for the two trans plaintiffs and granting the preliminary injunction. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=146.16s)]
*  So these are just three of the cases. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=151.36s)]
*  There are many, many more. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=153.0s)]
*  It is fatuous to say that the courts are not acting politically here or that Trump is somehow [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=155.24s)]
*  out of bounds and criticizing the judges. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=163.88s)]
*  Anyone who knows their history knows that presidents going back to Thomas Jefferson [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=165.64s)]
*  criticized the courts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=170.0s)]
*  FDR criticized the courts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=171.56s)]
*  Reagan criticized the courts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  And Trump is criticizing the courts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=176.24s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, Democrats all along always criticized the courts when they didn't get [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=178.2s)]
*  their way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=182.56s)]
*  We all remember also what the left did when Democrats largely ignored what they did when [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  things went their way, didn't go their way. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Vans off! [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=192.24s)]
*  Our bodies! [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=193.24s)]
*  Vans off! [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=194.24s)]
*  Our bodies! [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=195.24s)]
*  Vote them out! [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=196.24s)]
*  Vote them out! [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=197.24s)]
*  Vote them out! [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=198.24s)]
*  All day long, I saw the zeitgeist on the other cable networks. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=200.24s)]
*  They were all celebrating, of course. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  There's basically saying Trump versus the courts. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=205.56s)]
*  It's not going to end well for Trump, we're supposed to believe. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  I'll say tonight that is wrong. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  It ultimately will not end well for the courts themselves. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  We saw what happened to the credibility of the once respected and supposedly impartial [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=218.66s)]
*  organizations, all of them, when they turned against the popular will. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=224.7s)]
*  From the FBI to the DOJ to Dr. Fauci, the NIH, CDC, the universities, to the corporate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=229.3s)]
*  media, they're all weaker than they used to be. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=237.14s)]
*  Now why? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=241.06s)]
*  Is it because conservatives are mean? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=242.06s)]
*  No. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=243.06s)]
*  Because they were all in their own ways weaponized and politicized against the people whom they're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=244.18s)]
*  supposed to serve. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=250.18s)]
*  So in this case, all these renegade judges, all that they're doing with these Trump cases, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=252.46s)]
*  it's teaching the 77 million Americans who supported Trump that the courts can't be trusted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  50 years. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=263.3s)]
*  That's not me saying it, they're saying it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=264.62s)]
*  And they're saying it could actually get worse. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=266.98s)]
*  They're the most unpopular they've ever been. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=269.58s)]
*  And remember, this party held slaves. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=271.9s)]
*  And now they're being told to go into hiding. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=274.78s)]
*  If you're a Democrat, I'm going to tell you the worst thing that you could do right now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=278.5s)]
*  Speak for that god****** party. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  That party's brand is in such disarray, they have no ideology. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=284.94s)]
*  My only problem with the Democratic Party is that even the people that are good, the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=290.34s)]
*  brand of being a Democrat is so bad. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you got to rebrand that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  It f****** they s**** it up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  The brand so toxic that lifelong liberals aren't even staying to fight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=299.62s)]
*  They're moving to Ireland. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=303.9s)]
*  Where'd they come up with that plan? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=305.7s)]
*  In therapy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=307.46s)]
*  I feel on the verge of crying when I was there, when he got elected. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=309.1s)]
*  I luckily had a plan with my therapist. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=313.3s)]
*  Hope she's watching. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  Hi, Ann. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  And I said to her, should he be elected, which none of us thought was going to happen, I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  need a plan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=324.42s)]
*  And the plan was always, and only Ireland. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=325.42s)]
*  The Democrats who are staying don't have a plan. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=329.14s)]
*  Axios says, talk to 20 Democrats and you'll find each one has a different theory on why [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  they lost. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=337.14s)]
*  And Rosie's theory is a conspiracy theory. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=338.58s)]
*  So I would hope that that would be investigated and that we would see whether or not it was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=342.58s)]
*  an anomaly or something else that happened on election night in America when Kamala Harris [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  was filling up stadiums with people who supported her and Donald Trump was not able to do that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=352.86s)]
*  She sounds like Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=358.98s)]
*  Biden didn't win. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=360.62s)]
*  Did you see my crowds? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=361.62s)]
*  It's hard to win if you don't know why you lost. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=362.62s)]
*  And George Clooney is out there saying, don't look at me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=366.62s)]
*  Looking back on that, happy you did it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=370.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  I'll make it kind of easy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  I was raised to tell the truth. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser and I was surprised. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=377.22s)]
*  And so I feel as if there was a lot of profiles and cowardice in my party through all of that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=384.46s)]
*  And I was not proud of that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=392.26s)]
*  And I also believed I had to tell the truth. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=394.34s)]
*  Clooney just said his party is full of lying cowards and he calls himself brave for telling [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  the truth. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, I guess he's brave because you're not allowed to tell the truth in his party. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  And if you do, they take you out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=407.12s)]
*  But the rest of the country didn't need Clooney to tell them Joe was toast. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=409.12s)]
*  We knew it for years and we don't need a permission slip from Barack to tell the truth. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=412.90000000000003s)]
*  Suddenly all these Democrats want credit for telling the truth when the stakes are low. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=418.18s)]
*  Bernie just came out and said his party's trash. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=422.74s)]
*  It saddens me that when the Democrats had control of the Senate, they did virtually [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=427.26s)]
*  nothing for working people. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  I have to say that I'm a member of the Democratic caucus as an independent, so I'm not going [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  to lie to you and tell you otherwise. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=438.1s)]
*  And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=440.86s)]
*  and stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=445.66s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=449.22s)]
*  Berndog just told the country, walk away from the Democrat party and be an independent. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=450.82s)]
*  But Bernie's just as big of a hypocrite as Clooney. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  Bernie never said any of this when Democrats were in power. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  Now he wants Chuck's head on a platter. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=462.14s)]
*  MoveOn.org says it's time to move on from Schumer. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  They say their frustrations are at a boiling point, and if nothing changes, donors are [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=468.12s)]
*  ready to yank their funds out. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=472.52s)]
*  Schumer can smell the coup coming. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=474.8s)]
*  Leader Schumer, are you feeling pressure to step down? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=477.8s)]
*  Look, I'm not stepping down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=481.88s)]
*  And let me just say this, Kristen. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=485.36s)]
*  I knew when I cast my vote against the government shutdown that there would be a lot of controversy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=487.4s)]
*  And there was. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=497.96s)]
*  Chuck's wounded, the clock's ticking, and the Bernie bros smell blood. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=499.68s)]
*  The progressives are primaring the old timers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=503.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=505.88s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk are dismantling our country piece by piece. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=506.88s)]
*  And so many Democrats seem content to just sit back and let them. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  So I say it's time to drop the excuses and grow a f***ing spine. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=515.12s)]
*  I'm Kat Abugazale, and I'm running for Congress in Illinois' 9th District. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=518.96s)]
*  That woman right there, Kat, she used to work at Media Matters. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=523.52s)]
*  She used to clip things we said on Fox and try to get us all fired. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=527.08s)]
*  Now she's running for Congress. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=530.72s)]
*  This new generation gets going. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  It's gonna get ugly. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=534.6s)]
*  The problem for Democrats right now is if they're primaried by a bunch of Bernie Sanders, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=536.88s)]
*  AOC type Democrats, they're gonna have a real hard problem flipping the House. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats lost two big bets. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=547.76s)]
*  That they'd always win the youth vote, and when the country got less white, Republicans [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=549.86s)]
*  would be finished. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=554.88s)]
*  And they were dead wrong on both. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=556.34s)]
*  And now their coalitions crippled. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  Ezra Klein, a big time liberal thinker, says with the way the party's heading and with [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=560.74s)]
*  the number of Democrats moving out of blue states, Democrats could be out of power for [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=564.86s)]
*  the next 15 years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  Everyone's moving to red states. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=572.02s)]
*  It's boosting Republicans' electoral votes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=573.6600000000001s)]
*  So the Democrats could sweep the rust belt and still not hit 270. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=576.26s)]
*  They lost the working class and all their leaders aged out. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=581.58s)]
*  A new poll asked Democrats who best reflects the core values of their party, and AOC came [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=585.34s)]
*  in first place. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=593.02s)]
*  AOC is already taking shots at Schumer saying we need a party that fights harder. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=594.02s)]
*  And Federman told her to shut up. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=599.72s)]
*  Fight harder, he says, a stunt that would have harmed millions and plunged us into chaos. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  We kept our government open. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=608.5s)]
*  Deal with it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  Oof. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=611.58s)]
*  Federman just told a woman to deal with it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=612.58s)]
*  Are Democrats allowed to talk to each other like that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=614.62s)]
*  Now the media is not even getting along with the Democrats. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=617.92s)]
*  Okay, you're out there with AOC today. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=620.86s)]
*  Would you like to see her join in the Senate? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=623.74s)]
*  Right now we have, as I said, just a whole lot of people in the Congress. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=626.3s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, thanks for coming. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=629.78s)]
*  Wait, I got one more. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=630.78s)]
*  I got one more. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=631.78s)]
*  This is important. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=632.78s)]
*  Well, I asked you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=633.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=634.78s)]
*  You know, you want to do nonsense, do nonsense. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=635.78s)]
*  No. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=636.78s)]
*  I don't want to talk about inside the belt. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=637.78s)]
*  I was just going to ask you one more question about you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=638.78s)]
*  I mean, that's all. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=640.58s)]
*  I was literally the last. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=641.58s)]
*  What is your question? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=642.58s)]
*  I mean, it's easier to understand. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=643.58s)]
*  Who storms out of an interview and then comes back and sits down? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  What was that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=654.3000000000001s)]
*  You got to commit. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=655.3000000000001s)]
*  They want AOC to run against Schumer and knock him out because at least AOC can get a crowd, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=658.26s)]
*  even though it's basically the same crowd Bernie's been getting for 10 years. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=663.46s)]
*  But some Democrats think she's the ticket. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  Newsom is obviously setting up for a run for the presidency in 2028. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=671.18s)]
*  And I'm not so sure that his current strategy is really going to work because what he's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=676.5799999999999s)]
*  doing is he's trying to appeal to the right. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=680.9399999999999s)]
*  But what I see is people like AOC and Bernie Sanders, who are further left than politicians [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=683.7399999999999s)]
*  we've seen in the mainstream in modern American history, garnering so much support, breaking [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=689.78s)]
*  records with attendance at rallies. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=694.54s)]
*  What the left may need right now is possibly somebody further to the left, not further [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=696.82s)]
*  to the right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=701.6s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=702.6s)]
*  So the country's moving right and Democrats think the way to win is to move left. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=703.6s)]
*  Everyone fled California and Democrats are like, I know, let's run the country like California. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=709.7s)]
*  I mean, this looks like game over, you know, and the reason why people are voting with [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=715.5400000000001s)]
*  their feet is a lot of what your book is about. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=720.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=724.46s)]
*  And regulation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=725.46s)]
*  I certainly been screaming about it forever. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=726.46s)]
*  I did three years with a sign here that said, how long is it going to take me to get my [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=728.98s)]
*  solar hooked up? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=732.9000000000001s)]
*  Three years talking about it on television in this state. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  You couldn't do it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=738.5400000000001s)]
*  Democrats can't stop the things they want to stop or build the things they want to build. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  Do they have any ideas that are different than Donald Trump? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=743.98s)]
*  Because saying I don't like what he's doing is not an idea. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  Listen to what Democrats want to campaign on next year. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=751.62s)]
*  Well, we could eliminate all voter registration laws. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=755.14s)]
*  See, when Democrats get in charge, we try to protect voting rights. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=758.26s)]
*  We don't make voting easier. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=761.54s)]
*  We didn't have voter pre-registration in 1787. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=763.7s)]
*  We didn't have voter pre-registration in 1821. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=766.58s)]
*  We only started having voter registration, generally speaking, after the Civil War. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=769.24s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=774.64s)]
*  Don't regulate who gets to vote. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=777.1s)]
*  That's not even an idea. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=779.14s)]
*  That's just cheating. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=780.5s)]
*  Politics is basically about getting people on your side. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=783.02s)]
*  And there's a lot of different ways to do it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=785.94s)]
*  Patronage, persuasion, inspiration. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=787.9s)]
*  Kid Rock is doing conversion therapy. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=791.1s)]
*  Kid Rock was here a couple of weeks ago and he said, I want you to meet Trump. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=794.14s)]
*  He said, I'm going to take you to the White House. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=799.02s)]
*  So now we're going to do that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=801.18s)]
*  That'd be, I think that's a good conversation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=802.18s)]
*  And like there will be lots of people on the left who will be like, how dare you talk to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=803.18s)]
*  this man? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=807.42s)]
*  You know, I'm not playing this game with that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=809.2199999999999s)]
*  You mean girls play. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=811.4599999999999s)]
*  We're like, oh, you know what? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=812.6999999999999s)]
*  You can't sit at my lunch table because I'm just not talking to you. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  Not talking to you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=818.56s)]
*  You lost the election. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=819.56s)]
*  Who the do you think you have to talk to? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=820.56s)]
*  Bill Maher, Gavin Newsom, Stephen A. They lost and they want to talk to the winning team. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=823.78s)]
*  This is how it happens. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=829.68s)]
*  Once you start talking to the other side, you stop hating them because you see them [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=830.68s)]
*  as humans. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=835.14s)]
*  And then you find out you have a lot in common. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=836.76s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you're sleeping with the enemy. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=839.56s)]
*  The Democrats have gone so far left that Gavin, Maher, these guys, they're just looking for [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=843.06s)]
*  a new home. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=848.58s)]
*  It happened with Rogan, Tulsi and RFK too. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=850.08s)]
*  Republicans have this big, beautiful tent. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=853.46s)]
*  Why don't you stay for a minute, spend the night. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=855.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=866.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=867.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=868.76s)]
*  It's all downhill from here. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=869.76s)]
*  Happy Monday, everyone. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=883.76s)]
*  So last night, former president Biden saw Othello on Broadway. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=885.0s)]
*  Joe was surprised by the cast saying, I didn't know Obama was in this. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  With the Democratic Party struggling, Joe Biden has offered to help rebuild the party. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=895.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=901.76s)]
*  Wasn't it the party he helped destroy? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=902.76s)]
*  That's like Al Qaeda offering to rebuild the Twin Towers. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=906.76s)]
*  Let me repeat that. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=914.26s)]
*  That's like Al Qaeda offering to rebuild the Twin Towers. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=918.16s)]
*  I love you people. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=925.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump took away Joe Biden's security clearance. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=927.16s)]
*  That means Joe no longer has access to the daily briefs, which is too bad since those [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=931.24s)]
*  were the only briefs not covered in s***. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=940.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=942.16s)]
*  I'm going to smooth this plane out. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=945.16s)]
*  After saying his attacks on Tesla were just a joke, Tim Waltz said that Republicans have [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=949.16s)]
*  no sense of humor. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=954.16s)]
*  I don't know, Tim. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=956.16s)]
*  Millions of us laughed our asses off on election night. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=957.16s)]
*  What picture works? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=965.16s)]
*  A New York woman fell flat on her face after trying to snatch a MAGA hat off a fellow subway [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=967.16s)]
*  passenger. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=972.16s)]
*  In her defense, she was already pretty drunk. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=973.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=978.16s)]
*  Disney's Snow White is projected to be the lowest earning live action remake in the company's [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=981.16s)]
*  history. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=986.16s)]
*  It's the worst thing to happen to Disney since someone leaked the mini and Tommy Lee sex tape. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=987.16s)]
*  DoorDash will soon allow customers to pay for food deliveries in several installments. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=997.16s)]
*  Great news if you've ever dreamed of one day owning a Big Mac. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1002.16s)]
*  According to one nutritionist, the best way to lose weight is to eat like a baby. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1010.16s)]
*  Tough part is getting your mom to hold still. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1014.16s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1021.16s)]
*  The White House is seeking logo and branding sponsorships for this year's Easter egg roll. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1022.16s)]
*  Word is there will be a flyover from the Goodyear Blimp. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1027.1599999999999s)]
*  Too easy. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1033.16s)]
*  And finally, a UK startup aims to get humans living underwater by 2027, which would be [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1036.16s)]
*  an easy transition for those with blowholes. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1042.16s)]
*  I feel dirty. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1047.16s)]
*  I feel dirty. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1050.16s)]
*  Alright, the Democrat party is about to tumble into the abyss of permanent irrelevancy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1052.16s)]
*  A recent survey has them polling at only 27%. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1057.16s)]
*  Hell, Randy Reingarten's sperm count has better numbers. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1060.16s)]
*  But in the civil war going on within that party, the progressives have the energy, the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1068.16s)]
*  momentum, the jobless activists, and this guy. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1072.16s)]
*  Alexandra is extraordinary. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1076.16s)]
*  I am so impressed by her work in Congress and her just she inspires young people all [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1078.16s)]
*  over the country. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1084.16s)]
*  Would you like to see her join in the Senate? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1085.16s)]
*  Right now we have, as I said, just a whole lot of people in the Congress. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1086.16s)]
*  Okay Jonathan, thanks. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1091.16s)]
*  Wait, I got one more. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1092.16s)]
*  I got one more. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1093.16s)]
*  This is important. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1094.16s)]
*  Well, I asked you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1095.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1096.16s)]
*  You know, you want to do nonsense? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1097.16s)]
*  Do nonsense. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1098.16s)]
*  No. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1099.16s)]
*  Oh. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1100.16s)]
*  Someone got up on the wrong side of the autopsy table. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1101.16s)]
*  So is a cranky octogenarian socialist with a voice like an incontinent tuba the party's [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1108.16s)]
*  future? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1113.16s)]
*  Or is it AOC who believes that the future is flatulence? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1114.16s)]
*  And this isn't just about Republicans. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1119.16s)]
*  We need a Democratic party that fights harder for us too. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1122.16s)]
*  I'm with her. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1128.16s)]
*  If she thought gas stoves were a problem, she better not let a match near an 83-year-old. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1131.16s)]
*  Then we got Waltz revealing in a few words why Trump won every swing state. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1138.16s)]
*  Saying on my phone, I don't know if some of you know this on the iPhone, they've got [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1143.16s)]
*  that little stock app. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1146.16s)]
*  I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1147.16s)]
*  225 and dropping. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1152.16s)]
*  Now, I think he's only mad because Teslas don't come in pink. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1154.16s)]
*  But then he was forced at backpedal like a moon walking marshmallow. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1159.16s)]
*  This guy bugs me in a way that is probably unhealthy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1163.16s)]
*  I have to be careful about being a smartass. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1166.16s)]
*  I was making a joke. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1168.16s)]
*  These people have no sense of humor. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1169.16s)]
*  They are the most literal people. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1170.16s)]
*  Most literal people. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1172.16s)]
*  But my point was they're all mad. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1173.16s)]
*  And I said something I probably shouldn't have about a company. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1175.16s)]
*  Looks like Tim's comedy career will be as successful as his combat tour of duty. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1181.16s)]
*  Except this time it'll be audiences running away, not him. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1187.16s)]
*  But it's not just the old and new progressive guard that's literally falling on its face. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1192.16s)]
*  Here's an average Democrat female in her native habitat of NYC. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1196.16s)]
*  I could just watch that on a loop forever. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1219.16s)]
*  Isn't it beautiful? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1221.16s)]
*  Seriously, I think a star is born. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1223.16s)]
*  But you know, when you make New York rats point and laugh, you know, you f***ed up. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1226.16s)]
*  And let's not forget what's on the ground of the average New York City subway platform. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1232.16s)]
*  Yeah, her face is now like the Wuhan lab but with a mustache. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1237.16s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1242.16s)]
*  And what of the male progressive? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1243.16s)]
*  Well, here's one keying a Tesla while in his jammies. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1245.16s)]
*  That's right, a grown man actually wearing Lilo and Stitch pajamas. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1249.16s)]
*  No wonder Libs think Tampon Timmy's an icon of masculinity. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1255.16s)]
*  Sorry, real men don't dress like they want to crash your daughter's slumber party. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1259.16s)]
*  Then of course there's the lefty celeb. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1264.16s)]
*  Here's Rosie on an Irish talk show. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1266.16s)]
*  I question why the first time in American history a president has won every swing state. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1269.16s)]
*  And his also best friends and his largest donor was a man who owns and runs the internet. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1276.16s)]
*  So I would hope that that would be investigated and that we would see whether or not it was an anomaly or something else that happened on election night in America. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1282.16s)]
*  Is she cosplaying Ben Franklin? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1292.16s)]
*  Poor Ireland, suddenly that whole potato famine doesn't seem so bad. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1298.16s)]
*  Soon the Irish will be praying to St. Patrick to get rid of her and bring back snakes. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1303.16s)]
*  But understand that these dopes tell a bigger story. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1307.16s)]
*  That the Democrat party's in free fall. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1309.16s)]
*  From the lowest level man child to the highest level politician, there's no reason, no optimism, just insanity piled on insanity. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1311.16s)]
*  And it's ready to topple like a humid pyramid with Joy Behar on top. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1318.16s)]
*  Now, always applause for Joy. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1324.16s)]
*  Now this might be the future of the party, but it doesn't have to be. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1329.16s)]
*  There's Senator Fetterman, once a progressive darling who is now reviled by them for approaching normalcy. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1333.16s)]
*  You know your party's in trouble when the voice of reason is a stroke victim who dresses like he steals from a laundromat. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1338.16s)]
*  There's Ezra Klein, whose new book instructs Dems to embrace deregulation and technological innovation rather than kill an economy and set fire to electric cars. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1349.16s)]
*  It sounds level-headed, because it sounds like us. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1358.16s)]
*  Fine, act like us. We'll take it. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1361.16s)]
*  And sure, maybe they're doing it for political survival, but if it aligns with common sense, we win. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1364.16s)]
*  If Dems start acting like Republicans, then fewer people will die. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1369.16s)]
*  But good luck. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1373.16s)]
*  The problem with the Dems is the same problem you saw with ESPN or MSNBC or CNN. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1375.16s)]
*  When the competent flee, the people left behind will be left to die. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1380.16s)]
*  They triple down on the woke, get more radical, as identity politics remains the armor that keeps them from joining the rest of the human race. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1384.16s)]
*  They reject the hero's journey for the villains, because the sunk cost of their dedication to ideology has made it impossible to see a way out. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1392.16s)]
*  They're lost, miserable, destructive. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1400.16s)]
*  So it's not the Democrat Party you're going to see in the next election. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1403.16s)]
*  It's what's left of the Democrat Party. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1407.16s)]
*  Because what gets them out of bed in the morning isn't to help, but to hurt. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1410.16s)]
*  And you know this, and I know this, but do the Democrats know it? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1414.16s)]
*  Well, they're about to find out. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1418.16s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1421.16s)]
*  Yoo-hoo is his favorite drink and greeting, host of the Guy Benson show, Guy Benson. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1426.16s)]
*  He need a permission slip from his mom to do this show. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1434.16s)]
*  GOP Youth Advisory Council co-chair, CJ Pearson. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1438.16s)]
*  Her eyeballs are behind glass and her diet prevents gas. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1443.16s)]
*  Host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1447.16s)]
*  And like water aerobics, old ladies love doing him in the pool. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1452.16s)]
*  New York Times, the show's host, is a great friend of his. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1458.16s)]
*  He's a great friend of his. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1463.16s)]
*  And like water aerobics, old ladies love doing him in the pool. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1467.16s)]
*  New York Times best-selling author, comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyron. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1472.16s)]
*  Guy, great to see you as always. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1481.16s)]
*  You're finally aging. That's encouraging. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1484.16s)]
*  I'm wondering, because things often get worse, they change the name, political correctness became wokeness, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1487.16s)]
*  will the Democrats get worse or can they get themselves out of this? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1494.16s)]
*  It's the most important question in our time. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1498.16s)]
*  I think that's the most important question facing their party. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1501.16s)]
*  I think a lot of it depends on how the economy goes for the next couple of years, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1505.16s)]
*  because voters are willing to very quickly even stampede back to an unhinged party if they feel like the system is not working for them. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1508.16s)]
*  I want to just cede the rest of my time to a repeat loop of that woman falling in the subway. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1516.16s)]
*  Can we just play that for the remainder of my answer? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1522.16s)]
*  We should have it all for the entire show, just in the corner. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1525.16s)]
*  It's fun to watch. It's great. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1527.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1529.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1531.16s)]
*  Alright, let me ask you, where do you think her anger comes from? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1533.16s)]
*  You know that it's inside. It's not about the hat. It's not about Tesla cars. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1536.16s)]
*  There's something going on. Why is she so miserable, Guy? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1542.16s)]
*  Unhappy person. She needs to work that out. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1545.16s)]
*  They always tell men, go to therapy. She might need to go to therapy. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1548.16s)]
*  That's probably a lot healthier than that screenshot right there that we're seeing. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1551.16s)]
*  The other thing, by the way, about Tim Walz. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1556.16s)]
*  He said in that clip that we played that he is bothered by Elon Musk. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1558.16s)]
*  He said the guy bugs him in a way that's unhealthy. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1563.16s)]
*  And that is exactly how I feel about Tim Walz, as a matter of fact. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1566.16s)]
*  And the fact that he and Kamala Harris ran the campaign that they did, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1570.16s)]
*  and he looks around and takes inventory and says, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1573.16s)]
*  You know what this party needs? A lot more Tim. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1576.16s)]
*  That is delusional, but I endorse it completely because if that's their future, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1579.16s)]
*  they will lose for a long time. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1583.16s)]
*  Very true. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1585.16s)]
*  CJ, I'm glad they extended your bedtime so you can come and do this show. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1592.16s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1596.16s)]
*  Yes. Are you 16? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1597.16s)]
*  22. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1599.16s)]
*  22. Well, I was close. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1600.16s)]
*  So he's a legal guy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1602.16s)]
*  I'm fairly. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1604.16s)]
*  Guy is giving me the death look. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1611.16s)]
*  Me and Guy play for different teams. It's okay. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1613.16s)]
*  CJ, what do you think about the... [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1616.16s)]
*  Wait, Guy is straight? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1619.16s)]
*  What do you think about the Democrat party splitting? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1622.16s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that something good can come out of it? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1625.16s)]
*  I don't think anything good is coming out of this modern Democrat party, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1628.16s)]
*  but what we're seeing right now is 140 plus days after the election, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1631.16s)]
*  the Democrats have shown that they haven't learned a single damn thing [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1635.16s)]
*  about why they lost this election. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1638.16s)]
*  I got to tell you, Greg, I'm not mad at it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1640.16s)]
*  When your enemy is the middle of making a mistake, let them, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1642.16s)]
*  and that is what we should do. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1645.16s)]
*  All of those videos that we saw show us that the Democrats are exactly [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1647.16s)]
*  what they accuse us of being. They say that we're intolerant. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1650.16s)]
*  When was the last time you saw a MAGA supporter beat up a Kamala Harris supporter [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1653.16s)]
*  for wearing a hat that we didn't agree with, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1657.16s)]
*  or when they were running around Washington, D.C. with vaginas on their head [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1659.16s)]
*  and their gender-fluid husbands? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1662.16s)]
*  We didn't do a single thing about it because, guess what? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1664.16s)]
*  We are tolerant. They say that we hate the everyday working man. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1667.16s)]
*  Tim Walz was actively supporting the demise of the Minnesota Pension Fund, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1670.16s)]
*  which is heavily invested in Tesla, because Elon Musk hurt his feelings. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1674.16s)]
*  He can take his little Kia Bolt and do whatever he wants, and no one cares. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1679.16s)]
*  He is irrelevant. He will continue to be irrelevant, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1684.16s)]
*  and if he wants to fight anyone as he challenged people to prove his masculinity, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1686.16s)]
*  he should fight Tyrus. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1690.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1692.16s)]
*  We want to see you. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1693.16s)]
*  We want to see you in the ring. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1695.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1701.16s)]
*  You know, I can't get the image of vaginas on women's heads, Kennedy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1705.16s)]
*  How different would the world be if that were the case? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1709.16s)]
*  If that's where they were? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1713.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1714.16s)]
*  Well, I guess you'd stop looking at our boobs. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1715.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1720.16s)]
*  That's disgusting. This is a family show. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1723.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1726.16s)]
*  A man's family. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1728.16s)]
*  You tried to pimp out a teenager just a minute ago. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1729.16s)]
*  I clearly aged out for Greg, so he's got a new victim. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1732.16s)]
*  You know, disgusting. Kennedy, you look at people that key stuff, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1736.16s)]
*  and what is going on inside? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1740.16s)]
*  I'm the more curious, not just calling them names, but is there something going on? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1744.16s)]
*  Yes. I mean, we're in the middle of a mental health crisis, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1748.16s)]
*  and the crisis isn't just that people are in psychic pain. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1751.16s)]
*  It's that people only want to talk about their mental health crisis, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1755.16s)]
*  and they don't want to get better. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1758.16s)]
*  It's actually, it was a really important point that Kat pointed out in her book. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1760.16s)]
*  It's like, you know, people are so comfortable talking about, you know, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1764.16s)]
*  I'm suffering, and I'm depressed. It's like, that's horrible, and I have empathy for you, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1767.16s)]
*  but the point of talking about that is to get better, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1771.16s)]
*  but there's no incentive to get better when you live in a culture of victimhood. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1774.16s)]
*  It's like, you know, that's manliness. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1778.16s)]
*  That guy is shoving Tim's tampons up his butt. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1782.16s)]
*  They've got to go somewhere. They have to go somewhere. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1785.16s)]
*  Tyrus, what do you think? Do you have an overarching theme to everything we just saw? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1792.16s)]
*  I disagree with anyone. I don't think it's fair to put it on mental health. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1798.16s)]
*  I don't think it's fair for the people who struggle with real mental health issues. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1802.16s)]
*  The problem is that you have ignorant people who listen to the messaging. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1805.16s)]
*  The messaging has been violence for six years now. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1810.16s)]
*  They go on TV every time something bad happens. They say it. They preach, he's Hitler. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1814.16s)]
*  They make excuses for people who have nothing else going on, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1819.16s)]
*  usually people who like to make excuses for what's going on with their life. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1822.16s)]
*  The reason why I don't have a good job is because this person took it from me that it's always everyone else's fault. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1825.16s)]
*  They have the same problems no matter what situation you put them in, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1830.16s)]
*  and the only connection is them. That's the target. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1833.16s)]
*  It's the guys who look like that who wear pajamas all day because he has nowhere to be to dress up for, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1836.16s)]
*  and he's not good enough to be able to show up like this and do his job. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1840.16s)]
*  And they also rely on the other side's kindness, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1843.16s)]
*  because we make jokes about the woman who was attacking him. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1852.16s)]
*  She's lucky he decided not to stand his ground. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1856.16s)]
*  Someone's trying to take your hat off, trying to touch you. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1860.16s)]
*  If you watch the whole thing, she's screaming at the guy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1863.16s)]
*  The entire cart in the train is telling her she's wrong. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1865.16s)]
*  One brother's in the corner like, y'all lost, get over it. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1869.16s)]
*  He has every right to wear the hat. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1872.16s)]
*  Trump did good things. Y'all mad about the entire thing. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1874.16s)]
*  There was no one cheering her on, so she had to keep going to try to prove her little point, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1877.16s)]
*  and she also knew by his behavior of him backing up and putting his hands up, she was in danger. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1881.16s)]
*  She picked the wrong man to do that with, and he decides I'm not running? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1887.16s)]
*  Then what's going to happen? She's going to fall the other way. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1890.16s)]
*  So my advice to her is take two Ozempics and hit a gym and figure it out. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1893.16s)]
*  Yes! All right. Up next, the unlikely host who will meet with Trump. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1897.16s)]
*  If you'll be in the New York area and would like tickets to see Gutfeld, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYFpolBHLw&t=1907.16s)]
