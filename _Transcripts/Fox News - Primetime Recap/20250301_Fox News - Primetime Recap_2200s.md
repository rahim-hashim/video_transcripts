# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 28, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A)
*  As usual, the Babylon Bee perfectly summed up today's Zelensky Oval Office performance, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=0.0s)]
*  saying, Zelensky tries bold new strategy of insulting the people he's begging for money [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=5.36s)]
*  from. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=11.0s)]
*  Well, come on, Zelensky's super talented. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=12.0s)]
*  He's a diplomatic genius, in fact. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  On the Ukraine deal, his snotty behavior and eye rolling took a done deal on rare earth [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=16.72s)]
*  to a no deal on scorched earth. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=22.36s)]
*  During the war, everybody has problems. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=25.76s)]
*  You have a nice ocean, and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=28.64s)]
*  God bless, God bless, God bless, you will not have a war. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=34.64s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=39.0s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=40.66s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=42.28s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=43.8s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=47.36s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=51.72s)]
*  Right now, you're playing cards. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=53.72s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=56.0s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=60.2s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=62.76s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=65.76s)]
*  Now Zelensky's super silliest air, constantly speaking over the president, was simply dumb [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=70.44s)]
*  on every level. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=76.28s)]
*  The one person, one, he had to impress today was Donald Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=78.12s)]
*  And he failed that test miserably. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=83.22s)]
*  As for Trump's approach, he told Zelensky he didn't want to hear something, and it was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=85.9s)]
*  called the truth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=94.5s)]
*  You're not winning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=95.5s)]
*  You're not winning this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=96.5s)]
*  You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong from the very beginning of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=100.98s)]
*  the war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=105.26s)]
*  We've been alone. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=106.26s)]
*  And we are thankful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=107.26s)]
*  I said thanks in this cabinet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=108.26s)]
*  You haven't been alone. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=109.26s)]
*  You haven't been alone. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=110.26s)]
*  We gave you through this stupid president $350 billion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=111.26s)]
*  We gave you military equipment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=116.02s)]
*  And your men are brave, but they had to use our military. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=117.82s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, if you didn't have our military equipment, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=126.96s)]
*  All true. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  Now Zelensky plays warrior in his costume, but he doesn't realize his act is wearing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=130.92s)]
*  very thin and his banker, us, well, we're out of money. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=141.42s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=149.22s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=151.26s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=156.77999999999997s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=160.66s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=162.2s)]
*  Now today was the day that the pro-Ukraine war hawk crowd lost their cause. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=166.06s)]
*  Look, if you've lost Lindsey Graham. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=171.18s)]
*  I have never been more proud of the president. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=175.02s)]
*  I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  We want to be helpful. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=182.38s)]
*  What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=184.18s)]
*  And I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=187.58s)]
*  Do you think President Zelensky needs to resign to resume these peace talks? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=191.5s)]
*  He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=195.14s)]
*  to change. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, Kinzinger, Cheney, Vindman, the whole crowd, their hero, the man who suspended elections [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  in his own country, who basically did away with free expression, who banned thousands [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=209.82s)]
*  of Orthodox churches, came to town with an impudent, hectoring approach. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  Expecting, I guess, to be treated like he was at Harvard's Kennedy School or maybe at [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=221.34s)]
*  the Oscars. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=225.58s)]
*  Now think about how other European leaders handled their visits to the White House. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=226.58s)]
*  Leaders who also have some pretty profound differences with the Trump administration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=231.7s)]
*  With this gentleman on my right, and we look forward to keeping that going for a long period [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=235.74s)]
*  of time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=240.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=241.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=242.38s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=243.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=244.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=245.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=246.38s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=247.38s)]
*  They were gracious because they weren't morons. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  But any leader, especially a leader who's received what, about $250 billion, who's counting? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=254.22s)]
*  An aid in arms and humanitarian aid from the United States, enters the White House and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=259.74s)]
*  then disrespects the president. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  Well then you can bet that the 77 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump will [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=268.02s)]
*  not support any further engagement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=273.14s)]
*  Zelensky was like an annoying gnat. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=276.86s)]
*  He never shut up and camouflage. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=278.86s)]
*  But by about dinnertime on the East Coast, Volodymyr Zelensky had a slight attitude adjustment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=281.98s)]
*  On set with Bret Baer, there was still no apology for his rude behavior, but... [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=288.42s)]
*  So I'm not hearing from you, Mr. President, a thought that you owe the president an apology. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=293.3s)]
*  No, I respect the president and I respect American people. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  And if, I don't know, if... [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=303.26s)]
*  I think that we have to be very open and very honest. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  And I'm not sure that we did something bad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, he ended up saying, well, he thinks the relationship can be salvaged. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=313.58s)]
*  He had two or three chances to say he was sorry. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=317.5s)]
*  It can be salvaged and, you know, he is sorry if there was a misunderstanding. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=320.38s)]
*  He finally got that out of him. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=324.82s)]
*  That's all well and good. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=326.46s)]
*  But the man is still not living in reality. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=328.0s)]
*  We fund and have funded the lion's share of this war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=331.18s)]
*  And we're not funding it any longer, period. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=334.66s)]
*  Trump is driving the negotiations here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  And so Zelensky needs to lose the attitude. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=340.54s)]
*  Do you think the public spat in the Oval Office in front of the media served Ukrainians well today? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=343.94s)]
*  I think this kind of spat is... [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=350.98s)]
*  I mean, this is not good for both sides anyway. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=355.1s)]
*  And I will be very open, but I can't, you know, change our Ukrainian attitude to Russia. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=361.5s)]
*  And I don't want... They kill us for us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=369.66s)]
*  You know, this is very, very clear that Americans are the best of our friends. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=371.94s)]
*  Europeans are the best of our friends. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=377.14000000000004s)]
*  And Putin with Russia, they're enemies. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that we don't want peace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=384.3s)]
*  We just want to recognize the reality, the real situation. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=386.74s)]
*  But look, I think the spat in public was actually refreshing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=391.1s)]
*  Now, all these diplomats, all these globalists, the same people who failed America in negotiations and meetings, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=396.22s)]
*  Iraq, Afghanistan, throughout the Middle East, they love having it all play out behind closed doors. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  That way, there's no accountability when they screw up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=410.38s)]
*  But it was very important for America to see Zelensky's intransigence today. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=413.26000000000005s)]
*  But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=418.18s)]
*  I understand. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=421.5s)]
*  I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=422.22s)]
*  He knows the show. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=425.1s)]
*  And sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  And right now, Zelensky and his enablers are the biggest obstacles toward peace. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, today was interesting. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=435.38000000000005s)]
*  Zelensky went to the White House and met the fashion police. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=437.18s)]
*  Ready clothes? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=444.22s)]
*  How are you? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=445.06s)]
*  Pretty shut. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=445.98s)]
*  He's all dressed up today. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=446.98s)]
*  But everybody was getting along fine. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=449.5s)]
*  Zelensky was there to sign the mineral deal and start peace negotiations. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=451.62s)]
*  The first 30 minutes went great. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  Even the reporters were teasing the Ukrainian about his clothes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=457.98s)]
*  Why don't you wear a suit? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=461.66s)]
*  You're the highest... Why don't you wear a suit? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  Just want to see if you... Do you own a suit? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=469.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, problems. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=472.06s)]
*  A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=473.38s)]
*  I will wear a costume after this war will finish. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=478.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=481.7s)]
*  Yes, maybe one... [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=482.29999999999995s)]
*  Maybe something like this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=484.5s)]
*  Maybe something like yours, yes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=484.97999999999996s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=486.82s)]
*  Maybe something better, I don't know. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=487.18s)]
*  I do like your clothing, by the way. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=489.78s)]
*  Yeah, really? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=491.14s)]
*  Even I have to... I think he's a great guy, by the way. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=492.02s)]
*  But I don't know if you two like each other, but you know what? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=494.85999999999996s)]
*  I think he's dressed beautifully. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  No, no, why? I like this guy. I don't know. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  I think he's dressed beautifully. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=500.98s)]
*  So... [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=502.18s)]
*  Everyone seemed friendly. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=503.18s)]
*  About to eat lunch, doing what they do. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=505.1s)]
*  Then for some reason, Zelinsky got an attitude. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=508.1s)]
*  I want to see if we can get this thing done. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=511.82s)]
*  You want me to be tough? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=514.78s)]
*  I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=515.9s)]
*  I'd be so tough, but you're never going to get a deal that way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  So that's the way it goes. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=522.0600000000001s)]
*  The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=523.82s)]
*  We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=530.06s)]
*  that the President of the United States' words mattered more [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=535.1s)]
*  than the President of the United States' actions. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=538.42s)]
*  What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=540.9s)]
*  That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=545.06s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=546.66s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=550.46s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=554.74s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=558.02s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=560.14s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=564.46s)]
*  into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=568.1s)]
*  Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=571.14s)]
*  because you have manpower problems. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=575.46s)]
*  You should be thanking the President. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=577.5s)]
*  What the heck is Zelinsky doing giving us a history lesson [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=579.86s)]
*  like we don't know Putin's a snake? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=582.26s)]
*  We know Putin's violated deals before under Democrat presidencies. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=584.3399999999999s)]
*  What good does it do Zelinsky to call us naive? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=588.62s)]
*  We're not naive. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=591.42s)]
*  If anyone's naive, it's Zelinsky. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  He didn't even think Russia was going to invade, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=594.6999999999999s)]
*  even when Biden's CIA was like, guy, they're going in. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=596.9799999999999s)]
*  And if you don't think you can do a deal with Putin, then why are you even here? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=601.3399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's in Delaware. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=605.8599999999999s)]
*  This is a new group. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=607.5s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=609.66s)]
*  And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=614.02s)]
*  of the United States of America and attack the administration [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=617.18s)]
*  that is trying to trying to prevent the destruction of your country? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=620.02s)]
*  First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=623.02s)]
*  But you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=627.7s)]
*  God bless. You don't know that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=633.26s)]
*  God bless. You don't know that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=634.46s)]
*  You will not have a war. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=635.94s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=637.3s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=639.02s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=640.58s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=642.5s)]
*  We're going to feel very good. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=647.34s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=649.34s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=652.86s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=655.14s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=657.3s)]
*  Right now, you're playing cards. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=659.26s)]
*  You're playing cards. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=661.62s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=662.82s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=665.78s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=668.38s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=671.34s)]
*  Is he playing cards or Russian roulette? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=678.02s)]
*  Who does he think he is coming here in front of the cameras and telling our president [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=680.9s)]
*  that if we don't sign a security pact, we're next? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=684.9s)]
*  We're not doing a security deal with Ukraine. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=687.82s)]
*  That's why they're not getting into NATO. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=689.7800000000001s)]
*  NATO doesn't want them in NATO. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=692.5400000000001s)]
*  That's a trap. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=694.7s)]
*  That's going to trigger World War Three. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=695.74s)]
*  The mineral deal is the security deal. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=698.02s)]
*  Because if Americans are in Ukraine doing business, Russia is not going to start shooting [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=700.66s)]
*  at our contractors. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=705.06s)]
*  Ukraine's in no position to negotiate terms. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=707.54s)]
*  We're in charge. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=709.9s)]
*  We'll tell Zelensky what the terms are. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=710.9s)]
*  He can either accept it, fight Russia himself, or go look for another sponsor. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=713.1s)]
*  And good luck, because the Europeans aren't going to cut it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=718.06s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  I have respect for Zelensky. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  His country got invaded. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=724.02s)]
*  He didn't flee. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=725.02s)]
*  He stayed and fought. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=726.02s)]
*  Ukraine fought. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=728.78s)]
*  They fought the Russians to a stalemate in the East. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=730.26s)]
*  An amazing job. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=732.98s)]
*  But now it's trench warfare. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=734.74s)]
*  And they're dug in like World War One. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=736.64s)]
*  And the Ukrainians don't have the bodies to throw into the front lines like the Russians [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=739.02s)]
*  do. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  That's why Zelensky wants to end it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  The Europeans want to end it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=746.12s)]
*  We want to end it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=748.3399999999999s)]
*  And Russia does too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  That's why they're at the table. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=750.74s)]
*  A proxy war that goes nowhere. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  Is that in America's best interests? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky didn't read the room. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=758.22s)]
*  He didn't even say thank you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=759.98s)]
*  Have you said thank you once? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=761.98s)]

*  No. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=765.02s)]
*  In this entire meeting have you said thank you? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=766.02s)]

*  You got to be more thankful. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=964.26s)]
*  Zelensky wants guarantees. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=966.7s)]
*  I would too. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=968.0600000000001s)]

*  And if push comes to shove, something tells me that American weapons are always available. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=983.2800000000001s)]

*  And the White House staff ate Zelensky's lunch. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  We had a meeting today, as you know, with President Zelensky. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1129.76s)]
*  And I would say it didn't work out exactly great from his standpoint. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1132.68s)]
*  I think he very much overplayed his hand. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1136.68s)]
*  We're looking for peace. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1140.52s)]
*  We're not looking for somebody that's going to sign up a strong power and then not make [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1142.16s)]
*  peace because they feel emboldened. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1146.48s)]
*  And that's what I saw happening. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1148.52s)]
*  I'm looking for peace. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1150.28s)]
*  We're not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1151.52s)]
*  We want peace. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1156.88s)]
*  It was just my impression that if we do that, if we sign up, he's looking for something [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1158.6s)]
*  that I'm not looking for. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1163.8s)]
*  He's looking to go on and fight, fight, fight. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1164.8s)]
*  We're not going to keep fighting. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1167.72s)]
*  You're going to get the war done or let them go and see what happens. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1169.48s)]
*  Let them fight it out. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1172.8s)]
*  Zelensky messed up so badly, he lost Lindsey Graham. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1174.28s)]
*  What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1178.44s)]
*  And I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1181.84s)]
*  I don't, I think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go in business with. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1186.28s)]
*  The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president was just over the top. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1192.1200000000001s)]
*  This was a diplomatic catastrophe for Zelensky. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1198.76s)]
*  Without the White House and Republicans in Congress, Ukraine's toast. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1201.4s)]
*  Zelensky knows that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1204.76s)]
*  But for some reason, he didn't have the emotional intelligence to behave that way. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1206.16s)]
*  So talks are off for now. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1210.8s)]
*  What does Zelensky need to do to restart talks with you? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  He's got to say, I want to make peace. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1216.6799999999998s)]
*  He doesn't have to stand there and say about Putin this, Putin that, all negative things. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1218.84s)]
*  He's got to say, I want to make peace. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1225.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't want to fight a war any longer. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1228.12s)]
*  Zelensky was just on with Bret Baer and somehow made it worse. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1230.4399999999998s)]
*  Do you think you owe an apology to President Trump? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1235.56s)]
*  I'm just telling that I think that we have to be on the same side. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1238.84s)]
*  And I hope that the president on our side together with us. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1244.44s)]
*  And that is very important to stop Putin. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1248.76s)]
*  So I'm not hearing from you, Mr. President, a thought that you owe the president an apology. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1251.4s)]
*  No, I respect the president and I respect American people. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1256.28s)]
*  And if I don't know if I think that we have to be very open and very honest. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1261.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure that we did something bad. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1267.96s)]
*  He just got kicked out of the White House before lunch and he's not sure he did anything bad. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1272.44s)]
*  Does Zelensky not understand Donald Trump at all? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1276.8400000000001s)]
*  Was he not briefed before this? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1279.88s)]
*  Manners mean everything to the president. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1282.04s)]
*  Thank you means a lot to him. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1284.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, would have really helped here. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1286.52s)]
*  Our country saved your life. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  Zelensky owes us everything. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1291.88s)]
*  He had the same issue with Biden. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1293.88s)]
*  Biden's team had to coach him before he got on the phone. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1295.64s)]
*  You need to be more gracious. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1299.24s)]
*  You have to stop making so many demands. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  You have to say thank you. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1302.0400000000002s)]
*  And he'd get on the phone and he'd misbehave. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1303.3200000000002s)]
*  And it drove Joe nuts. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1305.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's driving Trump nuts too. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1307.48s)]
*  In any business meeting, you have to understand if you're the junior partner in the deal. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1310.44s)]
*  You got to act like it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1314.6000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the Democrats saw the president standing up for American interests and took [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1316.44s)]
*  the side of the others. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1320.3600000000001s)]
*  What we just witnessed between Donald Trump, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1321.56s)]
*  J.D. Vance and President Zelensky inside the White House was an ambush. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1325.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a planned ambush designed to embarrass President Zelensky in order to benefit Vladimir [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1330.52s)]
*  Putin. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1336.6s)]
*  What a complete and utter mess. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  And this is a gift to Putin. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1340.6799999999998s)]
*  We don't gain anything by acting like bullies. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1342.76s)]
*  And this is what bullies do. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1346.44s)]
*  And just because you act this way, by the way, it doesn't mean that you're tough. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1348.36s)]
*  The president of the United States is a coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1351.6399999999999s)]
*  The vice president of the United States is a pog and a coward who is Donald Trump's puppet. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1357.72s)]
*  And so what we just witnessed was a meeting in the Oval Office between two cowardly puppets [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1365.08s)]
*  and a hero. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1372.36s)]
*  This is just meaningless sloganeering. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1374.28s)]
*  What is the Democrats' plan for peace in Ukraine? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1376.28s)]
*  They don't have one. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1379.24s)]
*  What's the Democrats' plan to win the war in Ukraine? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1380.52s)]
*  They don't have one. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1383.6399999999999s)]
*  The Democrats' only plan is to keep doing whatever Joe Biden was doing, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1384.84s)]
*  which was fight an unwinnable, endless proxy war. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1387.8s)]
*  Give the Ukrainians just enough not to lose, but not enough to win. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1391.3999999999999s)]
*  And if you do give them too much, it starts a nuclear war. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1396.04s)]
*  How is that strategy in America's interest? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1399.8s)]
*  Ending the war is in our interest. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1402.68s)]
*  It'll lower energy prices, give us access to a new market for minerals, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1405.3999999999999s)]
*  pay down our debt, buy us time to build up our own armaments, which we're depleting, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1409.24s)]
*  force the Europeans to get some skin in the game and pull the Russians away from a deeper [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1413.96s)]
*  alliance with China. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1418.6s)]
*  Oh, and save millions of lives. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1419.96s)]
*  American presidents for decades cut arms deals with the Soviets. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1423.56s)]
*  Does that make us Russian puppets? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1426.6s)]
*  The whole thing's so stupid. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1429.4s)]
*  This is just about what it takes to get a done deal. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1431.96s)]
*  You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1435.08s)]
*  hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1441.72s)]
*  That doesn't work that way. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1443.56s)]
*  I'm not aligned with Putin. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not aligned with anybody. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1446.6s)]
*  I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world and I want to get this thing over with. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1452.6s)]
*  Does this mean Zelensky's been deported and isn't allowed back into the country? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1456.6s)]
*  No. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1460.52s)]
*  Sometimes you have to break up to make up. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  A lot of relationships go through ups and downs and people get back together. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1464.2s)]
*  A lot of deals blow up before they're eventually signed. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1468.12s)]
*  Hopefully this is just a bump in the road. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1471.1599999999999s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1475.6399999999999s)]
*  And tonight, one thing is perfectly clear. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1476.52s)]
*  If there was ever any doubt American strength on the world stage, it is back. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1478.52s)]
*  It is back big time. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1483.1599999999999s)]
*  President Trump will always stand up for you, the American people. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1484.28s)]
*  He's going to put America first. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1488.44s)]
*  We're not going to be disrespected. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1490.12s)]
*  We will not be swindled. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1491.6399999999999s)]
*  We will not be bullied. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1492.76s)]
*  Today, the Ukrainian president, Zelensky, frankly, in many ways, disgraced himself, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1494.04s)]
*  lost an opportunity of a lifetime to stop the death and destruction of his country. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1498.68s)]
*  And he did it on the world stage. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1503.32s)]
*  President Trump graciously invited him to the White House for a key minerals deal [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1505.4s)]
*  that he promised to sign, linking our two countries together with a long-term agreement. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1510.28s)]
*  President Trump even offered to reset relations after Zelensky, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1516.36s)]
*  you might recall, actually campaigned for Kamala Harris on the campaign trail. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1519.96s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Ukraine has received a steady flow of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1524.52s)]
*  and equipment from the U.S., including under Donald Trump, but under Biden and Harris, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1530.52s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars and not all of it accounted for far more than any other country [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1536.44s)]
*  in the world, including far more grants than the entire continent of Europe. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1542.1200000000001s)]
*  But in the Oval Office, while the cameras were rolling, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1546.6000000000001s)]

*  Zelensky's ego seemed more important than the war-torn people in his own country. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  And his behavior is something I'm betting he's going to regret for a very long time. Take a look. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1558.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1565.24s)]
*  You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  Hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal? That doesn't work that way. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1575.24s)]
*  I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1578.68s)]
*  America and for the good of the world. He tried the pathway of Joe Biden, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1583.16s)]

*  mattered more than the president of the United States' actions. What makes America a good country [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1593.72s)]
*  is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1598.76s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1602.84s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1608.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not strong- Mr. President, with respect, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1611.8s)]
*  I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1614.4399999999998s)]
*  of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1618.04s)]
*  lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president to bring it [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1623.1599999999999s)]
*  into this conflict. And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1628.04s)]
*  United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1632.52s)]
*  the destruction of your country? A lot of questions. Let's start from the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1636.84s)]
*  beginning. Sure. First of all, during the war, everybody has problems. Even you. But you have [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1640.28s)]
*  nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. God bless. You don't know that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1646.2s)]
*  God bless. You don't know that. God bless. You will not have a war. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1652.28s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1655.16s)]
*  we're going to feel. I'm not telling you because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1659.32s)]
*  you're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1664.04s)]
*  cards. Right now, you're playing cards. You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1669.1599999999999s)]
*  of millions of people. You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1675.0s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. Have you said thank [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1682.04s)]
*  you once? No, in this entire meeting, you said thank you. You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1687.8s)]
*  for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1694.52s)]
*  and the president who's trying to save your country. Please. You think that if you will speak [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1700.2s)]
*  very loudly about the war, you can speak loudly. He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1707.8799999999999s)]
*  trouble. Your country is in big trouble. You're not winning. You're not winning this. You have a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1713.16s)]
*  damn good chance of coming out okay because of us. We are staying in our country, staying strong [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1721.8000000000002s)]
*  from the very beginning of the war. We've been alone and we are thankful. I said thanks in this [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1727.72s)]
*  cabinet. We gave you through this stupid president $350 billion. We gave you military equipment. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1732.8400000000001s)]
*  You men are brave but they had to use our military. If you didn't have our military equipment, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1741.4s)]
*  if you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. In three [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1747.24s)]
*  days I heard it from Putin. I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1753.24s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1760.92s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1765.4s)]
*  Given a chance today, he had a chance to sign a mineral deal that would lead to a [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1770.2s)]
*  very strong relationship with the U.S. After that, hopefully a ceasefire. Then a negotiated [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1774.04s)]
*  settlement that would have been in the Ukrainian people's best interest and should have been [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1779.24s)]
*  the president of Ukraine's goal. Instead, too much arrogance. The president of Ukraine seemingly [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1784.6s)]
*  ungrateful for the hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars used to fund this war. Coming in, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1790.52s)]
*  he wanted to dictate to the U.S. how he wants more aid to come in further. How President Trump [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1796.52s)]
*  should take his side, which would only drag all of this out and that would mean more death, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1803.0s)]
*  more destruction and a risk to the entire continent of Europe. As a result, Ukraine's [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1808.12s)]
*  president was then booted out of the White House by the national security advisor Michael Waltz [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1813.8s)]
*  and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. held their head in shame. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1818.6s)]
*  Lunch was canceled. A joint press conference also canceled. The signing of the minerals deal is off [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1824.68s)]
*  the table for now. The State Department has even already terminated funding for Ukraine's energy [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1829.96s)]
*  grid restoration and President Trump instructed Zelensky to come back when he's ready for peace. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1835.24s)]
*  And by the way, if there is a next time you might want to put on that suit, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1840.92s)]
*  it is the White House. Take a look. Why don't you wear a suit? Why don't you wear a suit? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1844.8400000000001s)]
*  You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1851.08s)]
*  Just want to see if you own a suit. Yeah, yeah, problems. A lot of Americans have problems with [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1855.6399999999999s)]
*  you. I don't have such. I will wear a costume after this war will finish. Okay. Yes, maybe [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  one, maybe something like yours. Yes, maybe some something better. I don't know. We will see. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1869.96s)]
*  Maybe something cheaper than. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. President. You need to keep in mind [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1876.68s)]
*  historically, this is not the first time that Zelensky has disrespected the U.S. You might [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1882.2s)]
*  recall Joe Biden reportedly lost his temper with Zelensky because of his insulting behavior, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1886.68s)]
*  his lack of gratitude. Apparently the president of Ukraine needed a wake up call. This isn't Europe. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1891.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was able to do something that Biden and Harris were not able to do and that is bring [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1897.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin to the table. He has stated publicly he wants peace and this war to be over, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1903.88s)]
*  as did President Zelensky. So today was a golden opportunity for Ukraine, all of Europe and [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1909.96s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and Russia to stop all the death, all the destruction. And that opportunity passed [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1917.0800000000002s)]
*  over today. And by the way, the U.S. has now demonstrated over and over again under Donald [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1923.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump. We can and we will defend ourselves regardless of what happens in Ukraine. And for [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1928.2800000000002s)]
*  the record, the oceans are not our only protectors. We have the most powerful military the world has [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1933.48s)]
*  ever seen. We own the sky. We own the seas. We own outer space. And President Trump is [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1939.32s)]
*  dedicating dedicated to producing the next generation of weaponry, including, as he often [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1944.28s)]
*  speaks about, an iron dome that will one day perhaps save millions of lives. And our logistics [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1949.88s)]
*  are unmatched. We don't need Ukraine. They do rely on us and they have been as successful as they [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1956.3600000000001s)]
*  have been because of the hundreds of billions of dollars of your money that has been spent on this [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1962.44s)]
*  war that has ended right now on a stalemate. The American people stop paying that money. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1967.96s)]
*  They will be in an awful position. You have generously supported them financially, militarily. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1973.24s)]
*  We've offered humanitarian aid. And this, of course, in their brave fight against a truly [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1978.8400000000001s)]
*  malignant Vladimir Putin. Nobody disputes that. If this keeps going, there's not going to be [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1983.8s)]
*  a country left. So let's be clear. Zelensky's behavior today at the White House, it's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1990.52s)]
*  unacceptable. But don't take my word for it. On X, one of Ukraine's biggest supporters in Washington, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=1995.72s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham, posted this. Unfortunately, America was disrespected and the deal is off. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2001.8799999999999s)]
*  I have never been more proud of President Trump, Vice President Vance, for standing up for America [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2007.96s)]
*  first. And then Senator Graham went to the microphones, had this to say. Take a look. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2013.56s)]
*  Senator Graham, most Americans witnessing what they saw today would not want Zelensky to be [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2018.12s)]
*  their business partner, including me. And I've been to Ukraine nine times since the war started. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2024.6s)]
*  I met with him this morning. President Trump, I talked to last night. He was upbeat about the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2031.32s)]
*  deal. I've never been more proud of President Trump for showing the American people in the world, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2036.9199999999998s)]
*  you don't trifle with this man. And the question for me, for the Ukrainian people, I don't know [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2042.6s)]
*  if Zelensky can ever get you to where you want to go with the United States. Either he dramatically [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2049.48s)]
*  changes or you need to get somebody new. Wow. Powerful words. Now feel free to turn off the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2055.16s)]
*  noise on fake news CNN, MSDNC. In 1986, you may recall a similar cast of characters. They were [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2061.24s)]
*  in a state of panic. Remember Reagan walked away at the table from Reykjavik in the summit with [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2068.36s)]
*  the Soviet Union over the issue of SDI, strategic defense, mocked by the media, Star Wars, maybe now [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2074.1200000000003s)]
*  we'll call it the Iron Dome. Ultimately, Reagan's tough negotiations led to a peaceful end to the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2081.6400000000003s)]
*  Cold War. And now Zelensky is already trying to clean this disaster up on X writing, quote, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2087.4s)]
*  thank you, America. Thank you for your support. Thank you for this visit. Thank you to the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2092.6s)]
*  president of the United States, Congress, the American people, and Ukraine needs just and lasting [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2096.92s)]
*  peace. And we are working exactly for that. Apparently he even tried to come back to meet [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2102.84s)]
*  with Trump at the White House. Take a look. I want anybody that's going to make peace [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2107.7200000000003s)]
*  if he's capable of making peace, which he may or may not be. But I want somebody that's going to [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2114.04s)]
*  make peace again. He doesn't have the cards. When we sign up, he's got all of the cards. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  That doesn't mean he can fight. He's got to stop the fighting, stop the death. Well, he says he [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2125.48s)]
*  wants it now. He wants to come back right now, but I can't do that. Meanwhile, Zelensky did sit down [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2131.96s)]
*  with our very own prep pair on special report. And this is what he had to say. So I'm not hearing [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2138.44s)]
*  from you, Mr. President, a thought that you owe the president an apology. No, I respect the president [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2143.64s)]
*  and I respect American people. And if I don't know if I think that we have to be very open [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2149.88s)]
*  and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad. I think maybe sometimes some [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2157.96s)]
*  some some things we have to discuss out of out of media with all respect to democracy and to [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2165.4s)]
*  free media. But there are things that where we have to understand the position of Ukraine and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2172.6s)]
*  Ukrainians. And I think that is the most important thing. Yes, we are partners. You know, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2178.44s)]
*  we're very close partners. We have to be fair. We have to be we have to be very free. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtSQJ2Mg-A&t=2184.6s)]
