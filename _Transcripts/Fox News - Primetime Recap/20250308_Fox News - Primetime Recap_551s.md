*  I'll tell you my response, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=16.96s)]
*  my response to that is screw you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=18.8s)]
*  and the horse you rode in on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=21.400000000000002s)]

*  breaking the rules for them as a badge of honor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=25.0s)]
*  Democrats are jockeying with each other [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  to see who could be the loudest hooligan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=28.92s)]
*  Weird Al Green, who must be color blind [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=31.12s)]
*  because Schiff's pasty white, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=33.36s)]
*  says the only reason he got censured [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=34.84s)]
*  was because he was black. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  I had to sit in the back of the bus, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=38.92s)]
*  the balcony of the movie, drink from a colored water fountain. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  When the speaker decided that I would be removed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=43.96s)]
*  and then there was this motion, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=48.2s)]
*  this resolution to censor me, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  it became obvious to me that I was not being treated [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=53.6s)]
*  as others were. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=57.6s)]
*  And candidly speaking, it is invidious discrimination. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=59.0s)]
*  Weird Al so famous, he took his ponytail to TMZ, watch. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=63.24s)]
*  The president that evening called the Democratic members [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=67.28s)]
*  of Congress lunatics on national TV. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=71.8s)]
*  The president called them lunatics. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=76.04s)]
*  He did so and he has not been reprimanded, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=79.0s)]
*  he won't be censured. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=82.56s)]
*  He uses incivility to take advantage of our civility. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=84.76s)]
*  Hakeem's been telling Al to quiet down, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=89.84s)]
*  but Al's not listening. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=92.0s)]
*  He's only getting louder and louder and Hakeem's fuming. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=93.12s)]
*  Democrats are asking, would they have done that to Nancy? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=96.2s)]
*  You know the answer, never. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=99.84s)]
*  When Nancy said, shut it down, Democrats listened. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=102.44s)]
*  Hakeem's been privately sitting down Democrats [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  for come to Jesus meetings, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=107.92s)]
*  but he won't even raise his voice at them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=109.76s)]
*  They're not being talked to like they're children. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  You gotta treat these Democrats like they're kids. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=115.04s)]
*  It's the only way they're gonna grow up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  You gotta be firm. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=118.84s)]
*  They don't respect Hakeem and now it's a free for all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=120.64s)]
*  Who is the leader of Democratic party right now? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Well, I got into trouble because I said to Mehdi Hassan [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  on Zateo that we are leaderless. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=130.16s)]
*  And I don't mean that we don't have leaders of the house [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=133.44s)]
*  and the Senate, but we don't have a presidential candidate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  We don't have a clear answer of who that person is gonna be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=138.52s)]
*  for the next presidential election. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=141.76s)]
*  We've lost, you know, we have a new leader in the house. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=144.44s)]
*  And so I think that it is difficult right now [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=150.64s)]
*  for the Democratic party [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  because we don't have a clear defined leader. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=154.84s)]
*  Democrats have no leadership and no one's stepping up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=157.6s)]
*  They're all just singing, dancing and swearing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  And no one even knows what for. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=162.64s)]
*  For them, there is no policy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  There's only opposition. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Obviously I reach out to both parties in conversation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=168.52s)]
*  and doing my job and I hear nothing from the Democratic party [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=172.16s)]
*  in communicating a coherent agenda, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=175.96s)]
*  in communicating a coherent message. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  Democrats are just the opposition now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=183.0s)]
*  So when Trump stands for popular things [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=185.08s)]
*  that the country wants, the Democrats stand against it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  And then they become more unpopular. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=189.8s)]
*  It's a bottomless pit and they're all going down together. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=192.0s)]
*  They're like trying to sort it out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=195.96s)]
*  It's so funny when they try to solve the problem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=197.88s)]
*  They support each other, they go on each other's shows [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  and they're all in this together. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=201.88s)]
*  Well, we need that on the left. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Like, good luck. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=204.76s)]
*  You guys cancel each other [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  if your Ukraine flag is too small. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=208.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=210.64s)]
*  Six by six. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=213.04s)]
*  Yeah, you talk about each other for not having trans kids. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  You guys are out of your mind. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=219.2s)]
*  You're not gonna sink up together. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=220.04s)]
*  You're in a suicide cult. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  All this advice Democrats are getting [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=224.88s)]
*  is worthless. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=226.48s)]
*  Post videos, drop podcasts, fight, sue, play possum. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=227.48s)]
*  Not one person's told the Democrats, listen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=232.32s)]
*  You can't talk down to people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=236.72s)]
*  There's this like Ivy league pretentiousness [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=238.68s)]
*  in the Democratic party I feel, where they're like, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=241.2s)]
*  we know better and just, you must be stupid [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=243.48s)]
*  if you don't agree with us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=246.56s)]
*  And it's like, all right, well, I'm stupid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=247.88s)]
*  I'm dumb. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=249.92s)]
*  I'm dumb then. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  So why doesn't somebody meet me where I'm stupid [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=252.64s)]
*  and start at least making me feel like I'm not a fool? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=255.28s)]
*  First we have major developments from president Trump's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=258.2s)]
*  peace through strength diplomacy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=260.96s)]
*  Good news for the country, good news for the world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=262.64s)]
*  Today, the president threatened major large scale sanctions [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=265.12s)]
*  against Russia and Vladimir Putin [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=268.72s)]
*  if they continue to escalate their war with Ukraine [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=270.68s)]
*  while he is negotiating a peace. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=274.08s)]
*  The president was particularly tough on Putin writing quote, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=276.36s)]
*  I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=279.56s)]
*  and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  and final settlement agreement of peace is reached [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=287.36s)]
*  to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=291.48s)]
*  Get to the table right now before it is too late. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=292.92s)]
*  Putin is now saying he is ready for a truce. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=296.36s)]
*  Critical talks with Ukraine and the US are planned [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  for next week in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  That's called progress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=304.44000000000005s)]
*  What did I say a week ago? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=305.8s)]
*  We're not patting ourselves on the back. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=307.0s)]
*  What did I say after the Zelensky meeting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=308.92s)]
*  didn't go well at the White House? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=311.36s)]
*  I said he would be back, he has no other place to go. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=313.12s)]
*  It's in everybody's best interest [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  that the killing and destruction ends. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=319.08s)]
*  This did not take long. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=322.12s)]
*  Now the president is ratcheting up the heat on Putin [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=323.56s)]
*  and not too far away in Iran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Peace might also soon be on the horizon. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=328.52s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's maximum pressure campaign there [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=331.32s)]
*  appears to be paying off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=334.12s)]
*  Today, the president teased a possible nuclear deal [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  that would put an end to the Mueller's nuclear aspirations. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=339.32s)]
*  In fact, the president sent a letter to the Mueller's of Iran, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=342.76000000000005s)]
*  discussed the contents of that letter [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=346.24s)]
*  with our very own Maria Bartiromo. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=348.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=350.36s)]
*  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=351.6s)]
*  but we can make a deal that would be just as good [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=353.8s)]
*  as if you won militarily. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=356.0s)]
*  But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  Something's going to happen one way or the other. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=360.72s)]
*  I hope that Iran, and I've written them a letter saying, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=362.8s)]
*  I hope you're going to negotiate, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  because if we have to go in militarily, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  it's going to be a terrible thing for them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=371.32s)]
*  Now that entire interview with Maria will air this weekend [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=373.36s)]
*  on Sunday Morning Futures on the Fox News Channel right here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=376.08s)]
*  But after weeks of nonstop action, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=379.32s)]
*  it's safe to say that the Trump agenda is making big progress [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=381.64s)]
*  both at home and abroad. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=384.8s)]
*  Now the same cannot be said for the Democratic Party. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=386.28s)]
*  They have no discernible plan to improve the country [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=389.36s)]
*  at all whatsoever and then to make matters worse. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=392.76s)]
*  Where's the hope and the joy? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=396.28s)]
*  There's no sense of humor, no optimism, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=398.0s)]
*  just anger, hatred, rage, no big ideas, no leadership, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=400.36s)]
*  just anti-Trump rage 24-7, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  along with a heavy dose of intolerance [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  for anybody with a different opinion. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=409.32s)]
*  After years of woke indoctrination, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  cancel culture, righteous indignation, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=414.48s)]
*  Democrats totally forgot how to kind of just be normal, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=417.64s)]
*  authentic, to have a heart, a conscience, a soul, sympathy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  We got yet another weird, bizarre, cringeworthy video, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  this time from the House Minority Leader, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=430.72s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, who filmed himself [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  doing some kind of pre-rehearsed rant. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, take a look. Here's the latest. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=438.0s)]
*  Just finished up a telephone town hall meeting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=440.32s)]
*  with my dynamic sister, our Attorney General Tish James, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=442.32s)]
*  and my team informs me that some far-right extremists [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  have introduced a resolution to try to throw [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=452.32s)]
*  Democratic members of the House off of our committees. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=456.28s)]
*  That resolution is going nowhere. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=462.44s)]
*  You ain't throwing no one off of any single committee. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=463.8s)]
*  These people are malignant clowns. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=469.8s)]
*  You aren't throwing anyone off of any committee [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=473.28s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=478.52s)]
*  Don't make me expose you to folks who don't know you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=481.12s)]
*  The only thing missing was they're Hitler, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=486.68s)]
*  they're Stalin, they're Mussolini. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=488.8s)]
*  This is the leader of the Democratic Party [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=490.88s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=492.72s)]
*  By the way, I didn't see him standing for the mothers [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=494.32s)]
*  that lost their daughters to unvetted Joe Biden [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=496.88s)]
*  Harris illegals or a 12-year-old young man [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=500.0s)]
*  that beat cancer or the wife of a hero [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=503.8s)]
*  whose husband died in the line of duty. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=508.4s)]
*  Why wasn't he standing? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  Why wouldn't he stand for the First Lady? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  He would be speaker today if Democrats [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  didn't get crushed in last year's election. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=516.72s)]
*  And now, he frankly looks empty and pathetic [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=519.6s)]
*  like his entire party. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  And to be honest, this past week looked like a cry for help [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=523.68s)]
*  more than anything else, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=526.52s)]
*  a party in need of a major soul searching, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=527.92s)]
*  a change of course that in all truth is likely impossible [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=530.56s)]
*  as they cling endlessly to their radicalism [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=534.64s)]
*  and extremism. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSam-3IzZZk&t=537.88s)]
