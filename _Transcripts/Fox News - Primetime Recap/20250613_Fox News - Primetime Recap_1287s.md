# Fox News Highlights - June 12th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8)
*  More stunts, more theater, same truth. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=0.0s)]
*  At House hearings today, blue state governors embarrassed themselves in a series of politically [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=7.28s)]
*  damaging exchanges with members of the House Oversight Committee. Now, immigration was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=12.48s)]
*  the hearings' focus, and one by one, Democrat governors revealed what most of us knew all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=17.56s)]
*  along, that their priority is protecting illegals instead of keeping their own citizens safe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=22.36s)]
*  First up was Kathy Hochul, who extended her state sanctuary status multiple times, yet [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=29.76s)]
*  today claimed not to know about the criminals that she empowered. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=35.44s)]
*  Do you know who Sakir Akhan is? You should, as the governor of New York State. Do you know? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=40.52s)]
*  Refresh my recollection. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=46.2s)]
*  He was an illegal migrant in New York, and do you know what crime he committed in addition [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=47.6s)]
*  to being here legally? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  You do not? This was widely reported. He found a 15-year-old girl, threatened her with a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  metal pole, told her to get into the backseat of his car, he took her clothes off, and he [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=59.16s)]
*  violently raped her in Albany, New York. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=64.16s)]
*  These are high-profile cases. New Yorkers know about them, and you don't. So let's talk [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=66.44s)]
*  about Sebastian Zapeta Khalil. Do you know who that is? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=70.16s)]
*  I don't have the specific details at my disposal, no. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=75.16s)]
*  Well, this is an illegal migrant in New York because of your sanctuary state policies. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=77.8s)]
*  Do you know what crime he committed? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm not familiar at this moment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=84.28s)]
*  I bet you're going to be familiar when I remind you. He found a sleeping woman on the subway, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=86.48s)]
*  lit her on fire, and burned her alive. This is in Kathy Hochul's New York. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=91.56s)]
*  Now why would that be memorable to Governor Hochul? Nice job, Elise Stefanik. And Minnesota's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=97.0s)]
*  Tim Walz today denied that his state was even a sanctuary state at all. And he insisted [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  that they pass no law establishing that. Okay, but of course, he's playing a game of semantics. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  The Twin Cities are widely referred to as sanctuary cities, both by liberals who live [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=113.92s)]
*  there and conservatives alike, because officials shield illegals from ICE whenever they get [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=119.2s)]
*  the chance. That's kind of the definition of sanctuary. Nice try, Tim. The Trump administration [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=123.76s)]
*  warned them and 20 other counties in Minnesota to change their ways just a few weeks ago. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=128.44s)]
*  So today was a total disaster for these Democrats after almost a week of riots that their party [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=134.58s)]
*  is seen by many to tolerate and even encourage. Like their fellow Democrats on the Hill, these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=140.8s)]
*  governors are so rabidly committed to open borders that they're going to gladly risk [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=146.8s)]
*  the safety and lives of their own people. That's what it takes, including by the way, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=152.44s)]
*  their minority constituents who suffer greatly. And they'll do this in order to shield the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=157.28s)]
*  illegals from deportation. Remember, they don't think anyone should be deported. But [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=163.44s)]
*  big problem for them? Well, that's not what the majority of Americans want, because support [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  for deportation remains very strong among Republicans and independents. According to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=173.64s)]
*  CBS, you gov 54% of Americans support the president's deportation policy. And meanwhile, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  congressional Democrats approval rating and that same poll or different polls Quinnipiac [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=186.6s)]
*  is at or near an all time low. They're at 21%. Yeah, that's the new Q poll. Now, we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=190.78s)]
*  know even worse, 53% of Democrats disapprove of congressional Democrats. Trump's approval [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=198.48s)]
*  rating is 17 points higher in that same poll among all Americans. So look, Democrats have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  been literally wrong about everything. Remember, they predicted inflation with Trump while [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  inflation is going down. They predicted that the tariffs are going to jack up prices. Well, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=217.72s)]
*  that didn't pan out. They predicted Trump wouldn't be able to get China to the table [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  wrong again. And of course, they claim that their protests are largely peaceful. Nice [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=227.06s)]
*  try. Now, this week, once again, Americans saw what their coddling of criminals has created [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=234.9s)]
*  in blue cities from coast to coast. So what do you do as a political party when you're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=240.9s)]
*  losing the narrative on law and order? When voters see you as the champions of illegal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=246.18s)]
*  aliens and violent criminals, what do you do? Well, you try to change the narrative [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=251.78s)]
*  with a carefully choreographed stunt. California Senator Alex Padilla should consider a career [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=256.86s)]
*  in acting because today he laid it on thick when he stormed an L. A briefing being conducted [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=263.06s)]
*  by DHS secretary Kristi Noem. And in a moment of high drama, he kept loudly talking over [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=270.32s)]
*  her as she was trying to speak. His own staffer started to video when he finally identified [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=276.74s)]
*  himself. Watch. I have a question for the secretary because the fact of the matter is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=283.26s)]
*  a half a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating on your head. Well, as you saw, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=290.5s)]
*  Noem security officials responded by trying to get him to move. And when he didn't, they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=298.02s)]
*  forced him to the ground and they cuffed him. Now, when he identified himself as a senator, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=306.94s)]
*  they could have stopped moving, moving him, pushing him. But that look, that's not what [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=312.06s)]
*  he wanted anyway. He wanted his close up. Hands on your back. Hands on your back. Hands [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=316.3s)]
*  on your back. Hands on your back. Hands on your back. Hands on your back. Hands on your [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=323.66s)]
*  back. I didn't hear his staffer in the background saying you're cuffing a sitting US senator. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=341.86s)]
*  Maybe he was saying it. We just couldn't hear it. Of course, this is gold for them. It advances [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=345.76s)]
*  Is there a narrative that the Trump people are just jackbooted thugs, don't tolerate [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=352.3s)]
*  dissent? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=356.1s)]
*  But let's be real. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=357.72s)]
*  A sitting U.S. senator who is free to call a cabinet secretary anytime he likes decided [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=359.1s)]
*  to barge into a DHS briefing? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=365.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=369.62s)]
*  Because he said he wanted answers. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=370.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  Now at a time when there are so many threats against Trump officials, because of these [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  kinds of stunts, by the way, doxing and so forth, two assassination attempts against [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=378.82s)]
*  Trump last year, security is obviously on edge. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=383.74s)]
*  They don't want to make a mistake. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=387.3s)]
*  Well, and sometimes they'll make a mistake and try not to make a mistake. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=389.14s)]
*  But of course, he was ready for his star term with the cameras nearby afterward. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=392.82s)]
*  If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=399.5s)]
*  You can only imagine what they're doing to farmers, to cucks, to day laborers. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=405.48s)]
*  Oh, he's trying to conjure up the tear there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=415.24s)]
*  Apparing with Martha McCallum, Nome explained things this way. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=418.6s)]
*  I had a conversation with a senator after this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=422.8s)]
*  We sat down for 10 to 15 minutes and talked about the fact that nobody knew who he was. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  He didn't say who he was until he was already had been lunging forward and people were [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to detain him for quite a period of time. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=435.4s)]
*  If he had requested a meeting, I would have loved to have sat down and had a conversation [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=437.73999999999995s)]
*  with him that coming into a press conference like this is political theater. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=441.12s)]
*  It's wrong and it does a disservice to this country and the people who live here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  So we sat down, had a conversation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=448.34s)]
*  We probably disagree on 90% of the topics, but we agreed to exchange phone numbers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll continue to talk and share information. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=456.88s)]
*  But of course, look, the Democrats, they already had their talking points ready. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=459.84s)]
*  Why is it only Democrats who are pointing out that when a member of Congress is doing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=464.28s)]
*  his or her job, then that member of Congress should be allowed to do that and should not [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=469.84s)]
*  end up in handcuffs? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  And not a peep yet from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when something is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=477.28s)]
*  a threat to our democracy that we call it out regardless of party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  This is not simply an assault on Senator Padilla. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=488.08s)]
*  This is not an assault on Democratic senators. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=492.72s)]
*  This is an assault on our democracy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  And the Obama henchmen, they were out there chiming in. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=500.20000000000005s)]
*  You see, those people, they're all just like dictators. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  We're now more authoritarian in our government than most of the countries that we talk about. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  Where are we heading? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=513.0s)]
*  I think we're headed to a place where what is going to happen this weekend, where there's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=514.1s)]
*  popular mobilization and there's troops in the streets and there's a president of the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  United States who's going to watch tanks and helicopters go by him. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=522.04s)]
*  That's where we're going to be. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=528.0s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  So this entire Padilla skit was a lame attempt to change the subject. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=532.1199999999999s)]
*  But Republicans, for their part, kept the focus on the American victims of Democrats' [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=538.4s)]
*  radical border policies. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=543.18s)]
*  And what are one of those? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, we have a lot to get to. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=549.88s)]
*  Now, Democrat senators are joining the riots. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=551.36s)]
*  Alex Padilla, the senator from California, got handcuffed inside of a federal building [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=556.36s)]
*  this afternoon for lunging at a cabinet secretary. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=561.36s)]
*  Kristi Noem was in Los Angeles giving a press conference about the riots when the senator [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=565.32s)]
*  barged in and ran at her, yelling and screaming. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=570.2s)]
*  Sir, sir, hands up, hands up. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=574.36s)]
*  Senator Alex Padilla, I have questions for the secretary because the fact of the matter [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=580.24s)]
*  is I have a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating on your hands. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=585.4799999999999s)]
*  Hands up. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=592.92s)]
*  On the ground. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=600.92s)]
*  Hands behind your back. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=602.92s)]
*  Hands behind your back. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=604.92s)]
*  Hands behind my back. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=607.04s)]
*  Lay flat. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=609.04s)]
*  Other hand, sir. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=611.04s)]
*  Other hand. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=613.04s)]
*  Democrats must have known about the stunt ahead of time because within minutes Newsom [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=615.04s)]
*  yelled dictator and Congress burst out of their offices. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=619.16s)]
*  I just saw something that sickened my stomach. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=623.04s)]
*  The manhandling of a United States senator. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=626.12s)]
*  We need immediate answers to what the hell went on. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=629.76s)]
*  As if made to kneel before the authority of the executive. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=633.92s)]
*  Because he was so-called disrespectful. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=640.8s)]
*  If you can make Alex Padilla forcibly kneel before this executive, when does it stop? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  As a combat veteran, I want to know what this house is going to do. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  But because a senior senator was attacked, illegally attacked and drug to the ground. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=655.12s)]
*  MSNBC is acting like Trump fired on Fort Sumter. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=662.92s)]
*  This is a big escalation of what has been happening in California, born to immigrants. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=667.4799999999999s)]
*  He himself is the pride of much of the Latino community in the Los Angeles area. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  To see him manhandled in this way like a common everyday protester is going to be particularly [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=679.56s)]
*  jarring for many who are watching from California. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  The senator wasn't arrested, wasn't charged, didn't go to jail. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=689.24s)]
*  But was able to arrange a press conference immediately after. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=692.92s)]
*  If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=696.88s)]
*  you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cucks, to day laborers out [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=702.88s)]
*  in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=713.4s)]
*  Was he almost crying? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=719.68s)]
*  I think he was. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=720.68s)]
*  Noem says if he wanted to ask her a question, he could have just called. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=722.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, I had a conversation with the senator after this. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  We sat down for 10 to 15 minutes and talked about the fact that nobody knew who he was. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=730.92s)]
*  He didn't say who he was until he was already had been lunging forward and people were trying [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  to detain him for quite a period of time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=740.64s)]
*  And that this, you know, we're leaders, we're public servants. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=742.68s)]
*  And if he had requested a meeting, I would have loved to have sat down and had a conversation [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  with him that coming into a press conference like this is political theater. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=749.64s)]
*  The FBI says Padilla never identified himself and wasn't wearing his Senate security pin. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=754.16s)]
*  And no one recognized him because no one knows who Senator Padilla is. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=760.28s)]
*  He's the least recognized senator in the entire Senate. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=768.48s)]
*  So a guy wearing street clothes barges into a press conference just yards away from a [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=770.12s)]
*  cabinet secretary and starts lunging at her and screaming. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=774.6s)]
*  Secretary Noem security saw him as a threat and he pushed the federal officers back. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=778.68s)]
*  He could have been a stalker, an impersonator or any Yahoo off the street. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=784.92s)]
*  Trump was just shot. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=790.12s)]
*  He can't have random people lunging at cabinet secretaries. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=791.56s)]
*  These are the people who say no one's above the law. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=795.7199999999999s)]
*  They arrested Trump four times and charged him with 94 crimes. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=799.0s)]
*  But they think being pushed out of a room crossed a line. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=805.9599999999999s)]
*  Anyone else would have been treated the same way. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=807.16s)]
*  Police were just doing their jobs and removing a protester. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=809.96s)]
*  And now Democrats want to hold hearings. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=813.0s)]
*  Bill, you commit on the record to subpoenaing Kristi Noem because a U.S. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=816.12s)]
*  Senator was just thrown to the ground and detained in his own. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=821.72s)]
*  Democrats can't follow the rules. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=824.44s)]
*  Can't follow the law. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=826.2s)]
*  Can't follow the rules. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  Just shut up. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=828.28s)]
*  Just shut up. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=829.0s)]
*  No, you don't know. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=830.44s)]
*  You're not going to tell me to shut up. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=831.24s)]
*  Let's what? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=832.6s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=833.16s)]
*  How do you get him in order? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  You're running for the... [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=835.16s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=836.04s)]
*  He's... [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=836.8399999999999s)]
*  I... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=837.24s)]
*  He has been out of order six times. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  He's trying to get on MSNBC. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=839.64s)]
*  You probably knocked... [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=841.16s)]
*  I get it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=842.12s)]
*  Somebody off MSNBC to get on there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=842.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't have any problem getting on MSNBC. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=844.92s)]
*  I think as he's been arrested as a former Antifa member, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=845.3199999999999s)]
*  Back to order, Ms. Green. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=849.64s)]
*  Go. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=850.92s)]
*  He's a former Antifa member. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=851.0799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Chairman. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=853.24s)]
*  You got it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=854.36s)]
*  No surprise. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=854.76s)]
*  Who's a former Antifa member? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=855.24s)]
*  Me? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=856.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=857.24s)]
*  You. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=857.88s)]
*  Now, we don't know what was in the water in D.C. today, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=859.88s)]
*  but Bobby Kennedy should test it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=862.92s)]
*  Padilla is trying to act tough for his base, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=865.48s)]

*  No one takes these people seriously anymore. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=876.36s)]
*  The man looks like Code Pink, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=878.76s)]
*  and men should never act like that. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=880.92s)]
*  Lunging at women? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=882.92s)]
*  Screaming hysterically? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=884.4399999999999s)]
*  Close to tears? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=886.12s)]
*  Get a hold of yourself, Senator. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=887.8s)]
*  You're a member of the world's greatest deliberative body. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=889.9599999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to move the country through soaring oratory and eloquent speeches. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=893.24s)]
*  Or you write laws. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=899.88s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=935.16s)]
*  They don't really think he's a dictator. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlk6y6ixpx8&t=935.96s)]
