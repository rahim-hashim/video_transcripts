# Fox News Highlights - March 12, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ)
*  First, time to transition. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's good news. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=3.14s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=4.32s)]
*  This is what we say. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=6.16s)]
*  When we fight, we can win. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=8.92s)]
*  When we fight, we win. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=11.6s)]
*  Donald and Elon are bullies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=13.8s)]
*  They are afraid of pushback, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=16.64s)]
*  and we are here to push back. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=19.6s)]
*  Yes! [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  How many more do you want to kill? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=23.64s)]
*  Do you believe in the First Amendment, Tom Homan? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  While the Democrats scream at protests [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=29.48s)]
*  and struggle to do their own political autopsy, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=31.6s)]
*  President Trump is fighting 24-7 for America. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=34.72s)]
*  The goal is simple, a return to an era of peace, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=38.0s)]
*  prosperity, and common sense. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  And financially, we'll be stronger than ever before. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=44.08s)]
*  I think the markets are going to soar [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  when they see what's happening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=48.8s)]
*  And I want to tell you, there's tremendous optimism [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=49.8s)]
*  out there about our country, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=51.88s)]
*  in terms of regulations being cut, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=53.36s)]
*  in terms of taxes being cut. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=55.84s)]
*  It would be great if the Democrats would do [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=57.72s)]
*  what's right for our country for a change. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=59.64s)]
*  Isn't it great to have an optimistic president [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=62.4s)]
*  who has a real plan to make life better [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=64.84s)]
*  for Wall Street and Main Street? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=66.88s)]
*  Just ignore the sky-is-falling reports in the regime press. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=69.64s)]
*  Tune out the breathless reporting about market gyrations, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=73.2s)]
*  because even the most dedicated globalists, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=76.24s)]
*  they know Trump is good for business. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=79.84s)]
*  The president is engaged with the business community. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=82.68s)]
*  The administration is engaged with the business community. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=84.8s)]
*  And that's a different experience than what we've had [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=87.8s)]
*  over the course of the last four years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=90.12s)]
*  I'd also observe his sense of optimism [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  in the engagement yesterday at the BRT. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=95.16s)]
*  So what we're living through now is a transition. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=98.24s)]
*  And this one's good for us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=101.32s)]
*  For decades, ours has been an economy driven [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=103.12s)]
*  by government stimulus, a lot of printing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=105.92s)]
*  and borrowing of money, government spending, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=108.32s)]
*  government giveaways. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=110.72s)]
*  And Trump knows our survival, though, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=112.4s)]
*  requires a return to an economy by private sector productivity, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=114.32s)]
*  the way it used to be. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=118.44s)]
*  That's why the playing field in global trade [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=119.88s)]
*  has got to be leveled. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  We have tariffs on dairy products from Canada, 270%. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=125.16s)]
*  Going up to 400%, you never hear that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=130.04s)]
*  Canada's absolutely one of the worst. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=133.28s)]
*  And when I say worst, worst in terms of charging tariffs, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  they're dairy products. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=142.48s)]
*  They charge our farmers 240%, 250%, 270%, and 400%. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  And we charge them like peanuts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=148.48s)]
*  400%. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=150.6s)]
*  Oh, that's fair. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=151.76s)]
*  Look, Trump has been on this since, I don't know, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=153.16s)]
*  sometime in the 1980s. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=156.12s)]
*  It's very important that you have free trade. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  But we don't have free trade right now, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=160.32s)]
*  because if you want to go to Japan [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=161.76s)]
*  or if you want to go to Saudi Arabia or various other countries, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=163.2s)]
*  it's virtually impossible for an American [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=165.88s)]
*  to do business in those countries. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  A lot of people are tired of watching other countries [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=169.12s)]
*  ripping off the United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=171.16s)]
*  This is a great country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=172.56s)]
*  They laugh at us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=173.92s)]
*  Behind our backs, they laugh at us [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=174.72s)]
*  because of our own stupidity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=176.32s)]
*  Yeah, and nearly 40 years later, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=178.6s)]
*  now Donald Trump is in a position to do something about it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=180.76s)]
*  The United States of America is going to take back [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=184.72s)]
*  a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=187.28s)]
*  and by, frankly, incompetent U.S. leadership. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=190.2s)]
*  We're going to take back our wealth, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=193.0s)]
*  and we're going to take back a lot of the companies that left. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=194.44s)]
*  Take back what they stole from us [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  or what we gave away from stupid policies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  And you think about it, what is the alternative? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Keep allowing government to just balloon out of control? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=206.28s)]
*  Keep borrowing money? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=209.84s)]
*  Keep, I don't know, the deficit spending, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  two trillion every time we do a budget? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=213.88s)]
*  What happens when our debt becomes too risky [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=216.72s)]
*  and then no one wants to buy it? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=220.4s)]
*  They have to sell a quantity of debt [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=222.48s)]
*  that the world is not going to want to buy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=225.48s)]
*  And that's a set of circumstances that is imminent. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=229.0s)]
*  You are going to see shocking developments [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=232.48s)]
*  in terms of how that's going to be dealt with, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=236.16s)]
*  things that may not have happened in our lifetimes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump understands this, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=243.56s)]
*  but Democrats, for political reasons, pretend not to. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=245.48s)]
*  President Biden had left him an economy with steady growth, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=249.48s)]
*  with all-time high stock markets, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  and with inflation coming down. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=254.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was given an economy that was on the way up. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=257.04s)]
*  It's completely inverted now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=260.48s)]
*  No, yeah, okay, that must be why Kamala won. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=263.76s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=267.92s)]
*  Now, the truth is, Trump is delivering [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=270.0s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=272.24s)]
*  Companies are moving in or expanding, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=273.32s)]
*  not shrinking or moving out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=276.96s)]
*  A Japanese beer company in Wisconsin [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=279.56s)]
*  boosting its production. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=281.56s)]
*  Two different South Korean steel makers [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=283.8s)]
*  are looking to bring production here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=285.6s)]
*  And Volvo, they're considering expanding production [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=288.6s)]
*  at their South Carolina plant. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=291.48s)]
*  But still, Democrats want you to believe [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=294.16s)]
*  they suddenly have the real solution for the middle class? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=295.52s)]
*  Our unity of purpose is a clear sign [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=298.4s)]
*  of whose side we stand on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=302.4s)]
*  We're standing on the side of working families. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=304.64s)]
*  Pfft, okay, those are really nice words and well delivered. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=308.8s)]
*  But the actions don't match up [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  and the people are onto the scam. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=315.8s)]
*  According to an internal poll, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=318.24s)]
*  the Democrat group called Navigator Research, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=319.76s)]
*  only 27% of independents think that Democrats [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=322.68s)]
*  are focused on helping them, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=326.64s)]
*  compared with 55% who said they're focused on others. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=329.0s)]
*  Now, earlier today, our own Raymond Arroyo [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=333.92s)]
*  decided to ask folks in DC [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=335.68s)]
*  what they think about the Democrats. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=338.0s)]
*  When I say the word Democrat, you think what? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=339.96s)]

*  you know, a legislative body, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=465.88s)]
*  an executive body, and a judiciary. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=467.2s)]
*  What is Bernie, like 100? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=469.96s)]
*  He's lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, 9-11, COVID. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=471.64s)]

*  No. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  When Hillary told him to drop out or else, that was scarier. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=478.12s)]

*  Biden left two astronauts floating around up there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=485.56s)]
*  Elon offered to save them last year, but Biden said no. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=488.6s)]
*  He didn't want Musk getting credit for the rescue, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=491.92s)]
*  so he just let them hover. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=494.2s)]
*  And now, nine months later, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=496.12s)]
*  Elon's sending a rocket up to bring them home. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=497.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=510.48s)]
*  But you combine that with the power of the oligarchy [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=511.32s)]
*  in general, you combine that with Mr. Musk owning Twitter [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=517.36s)]
*  and able to send out his messages [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=522.52s)]
*  to hundreds of millions of people. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=524.48s)]
*  It's not only the power of money, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=526.36s)]
*  it's also combined with that, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=528.24s)]
*  the movement toward authoritarianism. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=530.24s)]
*  Elon saving stranded astronauts with SpaceX, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=532.64s)]
*  saving Ukraine with Starlink, and saving free speech with X. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=535.24s)]
*  But Bernie's mad Musk's megaphone is bigger than his. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=538.92s)]
*  It's not the size of the megaphone, Bern. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=542.28s)]
*  It's what you say into it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=544.36s)]
*  And what are these programs for working people Musk's cutting? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=546.4s)]
*  Could it be the 750,000 to examine social networks [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  among black and Latino sexual minority men in New Jersey? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=554.56s)]
*  Or 700,000 to study cannabis use [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=559.12s)]
*  among sexual minority gender diverse individuals? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=562.0s)]
*  100,000 for assessing sexual health for gay Latinos [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=566.12s)]
*  in the agriculture community. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  600,000 for teen pregnancy prevention for trans boys. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=572.6s)]

*  Yes, you do have to cut some programs. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=585.12s)]
*  I think there's waste out there, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=587.44s)]
*  I think there are programs that can and should be cut. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=588.64s)]
*  Again, we all agree we have to get rid [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=592.0s)]
*  of waste, fraud, abuse, duplication, obsolescence, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=594.24s)]

*  There's tremendous waste in government, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=605.12s)]

*  if he can stop the country from going bankrupt. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's a call to action. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1049.7s)]
*  You're hearing a call to action. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1051.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1053.98s)]
*  You're giving up your other stuff? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1055.5s)]
*  I mean, how are you running your other businesses? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1057.1399999999999s)]
*  With great difficulty. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1061.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1068.1399999999999s)]
*  But there's no turning back, you're saying. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1069.7s)]
*  I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1071.86s)]
*  eliminate waste and fraud. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1074.86s)]
*  And so far we're making good progress. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1077.4599999999998s)]
*  The party's flipped. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1081.4599999999998s)]
*  Democrats are for the rich. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  The Trump Republicans are for everybody. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1084.06s)]
*  And that has the Democrats rattled. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1086.26s)]
*  The America First movement forced Democrats [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1088.06s)]
*  into hating peace, progress, and making things in America. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1090.4599999999998s)]
*  They're even against black kids with cancer [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1094.86s)]
*  who want to grow up to be cops. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1096.86s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1098.66s)]
*  We start tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1099.66s)]
*  After eight long months stranded in space, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1101.26s)]
*  two American astronauts will soon, thankfully, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1103.66s)]
*  be coming home. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1107.26s)]
*  But not tonight. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1108.26s)]
*  Elon Musk's SpaceX postponed the launch [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1109.26s)]
*  of its Falcon 9 rocket because of a small hydraulic issue. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1112.06s)]
*  But soon, the two stranded Americans will be retrieved. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1115.66s)]
*  And that'll be in the very near future. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1118.8600000000001s)]
*  Four other astronauts will take their place [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1120.46s)]
*  in the next two weeks. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1122.66s)]
*  And the American people are ready to go. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1124.06s)]
*  Four other astronauts will take their place [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1126.46s)]
*  at the International Space Station. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1128.66s)]
*  And this will be a historic rescue operation. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1130.8600000000001s)]
*  Now, according to Musk and one of the stranded American [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1134.06s)]
*  astronauts, it could have all happened months and months ago, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1136.66s)]
*  if not for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1139.8600000000001s)]
*  Then President Biden turned down Elon Musk's offer [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1142.26s)]
*  to make the rescue because of political reasons. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1145.66s)]
*  They didn't want to give the win to Donald Trump. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1148.46s)]
*  And yet, according to radical far-left Democrats, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1150.46s)]
*  well, the guy bringing home our stranded astronauts [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1153.46s)]
*  is a villain. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1156.26s)]
*  You should not like him. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1157.06s)]
*  In fact, some on the radical left [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1158.46s)]
*  are calling for Elon Musk. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1159.86s)]
*  This is getting really pathetic. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1161.46s)]
*  And these people need to be discovered and arrested [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1162.86s)]
*  and prosecuted. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1165.46s)]
*  They're calling for his assassination. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1166.66s)]
*  Others committing acts of outright terrorism [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1168.46s)]
*  against Tesla, dealerships, torching vehicles, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1170.86s)]
*  and charging stations, even shooting into showrooms. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1173.86s)]
*  In London, a group of far-left nutjobs [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1177.06s)]
*  pouring liquid latex over Tesla's state-of-the-art robot, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1180.06s)]
*  referring to it as a Nazi robot. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1183.86s)]
*  So why, ask yourself, why do they hate Elon Musk? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1186.86s)]
*  For giving free communications to the victims [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1191.06s)]
*  of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  when they had no connection with the outside world [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1196.06s)]
*  or wildfire victims in California, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1198.86s)]
*  for building 1,000 horsepower self-driving electric car [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1201.86s)]
*  that most American, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1207.26s)]
*  that is the most American-made car in the country, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1208.86s)]
*  for simply helping President Trump for free, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1212.06s)]
*  exposing waste, fraud, abuse, corruption [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1214.86s)]
*  inside our government. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1217.26s)]
*  But the even bigger nutjobs on MSDNC, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1218.6599999999999s)]
*  our old friends, Liberal Joe and company, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1221.6599999999999s)]
*  they don't seem to have a problem [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1224.06s)]
*  with any of the left's extremism. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1225.06s)]
*  Instead, they are distraught that violent arsonists [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1227.4599999999998s)]
*  and rioters might be tried as terrorists. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1230.26s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1232.86s)]
*  But then you also overnight have this post claiming [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1234.4599999999998s)]
*  that protests at Tesla dealerships are illegal. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1237.06s)]
*  He said today he would label violence [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1240.6599999999999s)]
*  against dealerships, domestic terrorism. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1243.06s)]
*  So just to be clear, you protest a private company, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1244.86s)]
*  you are labeled by this administration [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1247.86s)]
*  a domestic terrorist. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1249.6599999999999s)]
*  No, they are shooting, they're shooting bullets into showrooms. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1252.26s)]
*  They're threatening assassination. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1256.86s)]
*  They are burning cars, they are burning charging stations. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1258.86s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a little different [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1262.86s)]
*  if you want to tell the truth at MSDNC. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1264.86s)]
*  Of course, this is NBC News. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1267.4599999999998s)]
*  But according to Democrats, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1269.86s)]
*  if you walk into the Capitol building on January 6th, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1271.06s)]
*  everybody deserved to be locked up [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1274.06s)]
*  for years and years and years. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1275.86s)]
*  But of course, the summer of 2020, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1277.86s)]
*  the 574 riots that killed dozens, injured thousands of cops, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1279.46s)]
*  caused billions in property damage. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1284.06s)]
*  Oh, Kamala Harris, their candidate of choice, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1286.26s)]
*  they're not gonna stop rioting. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1288.86s)]
*  They shouldn't stop rioting [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1290.26s)]
*  and we're not gonna stop supporting them. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1291.46s)]
*  But if you shoot at a Tesla dealership, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1293.46s)]
*  you blow up a cyber truck, what, that's a peaceful protest? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1295.26s)]
*  And should be honored and respected as free speech. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1298.8600000000001s)]
*  The left is up in arms over Elon Musk, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1302.46s)]
*  the guy whose company is attempting to rescue [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1304.96s)]
*  American astronauts stranded in space by Joe and Kamala. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1307.76s)]
*  And if Democrats hate Trump and Musk that much, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1312.26s)]
*  maybe they should just follow old Rosie O'Donnell's lead. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1315.26s)]
*  That's right, sad news for the 12 or 13 or 14 [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1318.66s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell fans across the country. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1322.7s)]
*  As we showed you last night, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1325.0600000000002s)]
*  she is no longer living in the US of A [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1326.36s)]
*  in a desperate attempt to calm her anti-Trump rage. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1328.9599999999998s)]
*  But the fact that she's been triggered, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1332.36s)]
*  Rosie has now moved to Ireland. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1334.4599999999998s)]
*  And this was funny, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  today during a joint press conference at the White House, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1338.26s)]
*  Ireland's Prime Minister was asked [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1341.1599999999999s)]
*  about his country's newest resident. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1342.9599999999998s)]
*  Let's take a look at this. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1344.76s)]
*  Ireland is known for very happy, fun-loving people, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1346.4599999999998s)]
*  great attitude, many in this room right now that I've met. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  Why in the world would you let Rosie O'Donnell move to Ireland? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1353.6599999999999s)]
*  This is going to blow your happiness away. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1357.56s)]
*  That's true, thank you, I like that question. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1359.26s)]
*  Do you know you have Rosie O'Donnell? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1362.86s)]
*  Do you know who she is? Do you know who she is? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1364.76s)]
*  You're better off not knowing. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1368.86s)]
*  You're better off not knowing. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1373.96s)]
*  Having been on The View with her, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1375.36s)]
*  I actually agree with the president. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1376.76s)]
*  Now the president was in rare form today [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1378.46s)]
*  during a wide ranging, frankly entertaining press conference. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1380.26s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1383.46s)]
*  And by the way, I have to speak of inflation. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1386.8600000000001s)]
*  I love these socks, what's with these socks? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1389.66s)]
*  President Trump, you know, I'm trying to stay focused, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1392.06s)]
*  but I'm very impressed with the VPs. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1398.06s)]
*  I can't even see the socks, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1402.16s)]
*  I don't know what they look like. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1403.76s)]
*  Anyway, President Trump clearly upbeat and for good reason. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1404.76s)]
*  In less than two months, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1407.76s)]
*  a recurring theme has emerged from his second term. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1408.8600000000001s)]
*  It's simple, but it's profound. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1412.16s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1413.96s)]
*  Let's start at the border, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1415.8600000000001s)]
*  where illegal immigration has almost completely stopped, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1416.8600000000001s)]
*  all while deportations are way up, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1419.96s)]
*  unlike the old border czar, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1422.5600000000002s)]
*  and unlike Alejandro Mayorkas, Tom Homan, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1424.5600000000002s)]
*  and Kristi Noem actually know what they're doing. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1427.66s)]
*  They're making no apologies [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1430.0600000000002s)]
*  for protecting the American people. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1431.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1433.0600000000002s)]
*  Now I always hear all the time, family separation, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1434.46s)]
*  Homan's a godfather of family separation. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1437.0600000000002s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1440.16s)]
*  Zero tolerance is about saving lives. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1442.26s)]
*  When we fear we start prosecuting people [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1444.66s)]
*  who violate the law and put the children in harm's way, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1446.26s)]
*  maybe they stop coming. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1448.66s)]
*  And they did, numbers went down. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1449.96s)]
*  It's unfortunate families got separated, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1451.46s)]
*  but it happens to American families every day. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1453.5600000000002s)]
*  It's gonna happen in Albany today, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1455.66s)]
*  that American family will be separated by law enforcement [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1457.46s)]
*  because the child can't go to jail with a parent. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1459.5600000000002s)]
*  But you want to talk about family separation? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1462.76s)]
*  A half a million children on Joe Biden [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1464.46s)]
*  were trafficked into this country. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1466.0600000000002s)]
*  They can't find 300,000 of them. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1467.46s)]
*  That's a separation. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1469.46s)]
*  But you know what President Trump's committed? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1471.46s)]
*  We're gonna find them and we're gonna save them. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1473.16s)]
*  It's over 300,000. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1476.26s)]
*  And by the way, he was heckled on his way [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1477.56s)]
*  into meeting some of these New York politicians. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1480.06s)]
*  And borders are Tom Homan will join us straight ahead tonight. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1482.46s)]
*  But this brings us to yet another major promise made [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1485.3600000000001s)]
*  and promise kept by President Donald Trump. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1488.56s)]
*  Tonight, I am happy to report prices are coming down. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1490.76s)]
*  That includes the cost of gas, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1493.96s)]
*  which hasn't been this cheap in the month of March since 2021. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1495.76s)]
*  Look at this, dramatically. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1500.6599999999999s)]
*  Egg prices are also plummeting. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1502.46s)]
*  They are now cheaper than when Donald Trump took office. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1504.6599999999999s)]
*  Bye bye, left-wing talking point. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1507.36s)]
*  Interest rates on mortgages, they're also down. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1509.36s)]
*  Now dropping for the sixth consecutive week [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1512.56s)]
*  and driving a spike in the real estate market. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1515.46s)]
*  Overall inflation is now down with a new report [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1518.56s)]
*  that we're even better than expected. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1522.26s)]
*  And American manufacturing is once again on the rise, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1524.86s)]
*  but don't take my word for it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1527.46s)]
*  This is what several business leaders [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1529.26s)]
*  and even fake news CNN are saying about the economy. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1530.8600000000001s)]
*  You decide. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1533.5600000000002s)]
*  Manufacture is back. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1535.5600000000002s)]
*  If you believe that the supply chain [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1537.96s)]
*  bringing parts of cars across the border [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1540.46s)]
*  with Mexico or Canada seven times, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1543.0600000000002s)]
*  and this is efficient, this is not. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1545.76s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1548.76s)]
*  We've got to build in America. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1550.0600000000002s)]
*  We've got to produce things here. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1551.5600000000002s)]
*  Finally, we have some good news on the economy [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1553.26s)]
*  and really the number one issue for many Americans, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1555.46s)]
*  the cost of living. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1557.5600000000002s)]
*  So we just learned that consumer prices in February [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1558.56s)]
*  increased by 2.8% year over year, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1561.36s)]
*  0.2% month over month. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1564.76s)]
*  Both of these figures were a step in the right direction [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1566.76s)]
*  and both were better than expected. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1569.76s)]
*  So this is definitely very encouraging to see. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1572.76s)]
*  One of the things that I do like is that [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1576.1599999999999s)]
*  the president is engaged with the business community. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1578.76s)]
*  The administration is engaged with the business community. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1580.96s)]
*  And that's a different experience [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1583.96s)]
*  than what we've had over the course of the last four years. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1585.6599999999999s)]
*  And because of the president's policies, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1588.46s)]
*  Nissan and Honda, they were both going to build [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1590.3600000000001s)]
*  manufacturing centers in Mexico. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1593.66s)]
*  Now they're moving them to the U.S. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1595.3600000000001s)]
*  Apple is committed to now investing $500 billion [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1597.16s)]
*  in four years in Texas, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  building out a facility down there [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1602.16s)]
*  that will create tens of thousands of jobs. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1603.76s)]
*  A Taiwanese chip company, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1605.96s)]
*  they're gonna spend $100 million right here in the U.S. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1607.76s)]
*  As it turns out, the ongoing trade negotiations [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1610.66s)]
*  are not causing the sky to fall [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1613.66s)]
*  as some on the left have predicted. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1615.76s)]
*  Instead, Canada, the EU, are being held accountable [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1617.6599999999999s)]
*  for their unfair trade practices. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1620.96s)]
*  And that brings us to an ongoing Hannity investigation. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1623.26s)]
*  And that's into tariffs and taxes. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1626.26s)]
*  This is information the mainstream corrupt legacy [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1628.46s)]
*  media mob will never tell you. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1631.36s)]
*  Keep in mind, Canada claims to be a proponent of free trade, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1632.6599999999999s)]
*  but they have consistently levied maximum tariffs [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1636.56s)]
*  of 298% for our butter, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1639.86s)]
*  245% for our cheese, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1642.6599999999999s)]
*  241% for our milk. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1645.06s)]
*  What about dairy farmers in Wisconsin? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1647.56s)]
*  Should we not stand up for them? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1649.3600000000001s)]
*  Canada also imposes a 5% value added tax, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1650.96s)]
*  or national sales tax, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1654.76s)]
*  on pretty much almost everything imported from the U.S. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1656.46s)]
*  And it's even worse with the European Union, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1660.06s)]
*  a value added tax ranging from 8% to over 25%. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1662.26s)]
*  The EU has also long imposed a 5.5% tariff [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1666.76s)]
*  on all U.S. goods. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1670.66s)]
*  So President Trump is rightly negotiating a better deal, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1672.76s)]
*  so prices will go down for you, the American people. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1677.16s)]
*  Is he supposed to sit there and just take it, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1679.96s)]
*  like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and do nothing? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1682.0600000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's incentivizing all of this new manufacturing [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1684.8600000000001s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1688.26s)]
*  And let's also be clear, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1689.46s)]
*  as we have seen over and over again, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1690.76s)]
*  it'd never be a good idea to bet against Donald Trump. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1692.66s)]
*  How many bet against Zelensky coming back? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1696.0600000000002s)]
*  Hmm, a lot of people. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1698.5600000000002s)]
*  How many people like us were telling you, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1700.26s)]
*  he'll be back, and he was, and he will be, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1702.06s)]
*  and guess what, these countries will negotiate, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1704.46s)]
*  and you'll pay less. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1706.6599999999999s)]
*  Now, this was a president who oversaw [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1707.86s)]
*  what was record-breaking in terms of the economy [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1710.6599999999999s)]
*  in his first terms, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1712.96s)]
*  historic gains in the economy. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1714.46s)]
*  Look at those gains right there, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1716.26s)]
*  thanks to our friend Steve Moore, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1718.46s)]
*  who will join us in a minute. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1719.76s)]
*  Record gains for the S&P, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1720.86s)]
*  record gains for the NASDAQ, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1722.76s)]
*  but apparently the Democratic Party [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1724.56s)]
*  wants to shut it all down, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1726.46s)]
*  never mind the fact that he created record low [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1727.86s)]
*  after record low unemployment levels for every demographic, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1730.1599999999999s)]
*  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1733.56s)]
*  women in the workplace, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1736.56s)]
*  African American youth unemployment. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1737.96s)]
*  Senate Democrats, they are now planning to block [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1739.96s)]
*  the House funding bill, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1742.6599999999999s)]
*  shut down the government on Friday. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  This will be called the Schumer shutdown, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1746.76s)]
*  get used to that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1748.46s)]
*  Don't forget this, you know, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1749.46s)]
*  this is their economic plan. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1751.6599999999999s)]
*  We are currently living under the Democrats [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1753.6599999999999s)]
*  and the Biden and Harris economy. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1756.46s)]
*  We need the CR to fund the government. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1759.16s)]
*  They didn't fund the government. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1761.26s)]
*  They didn't, Schumer never passed a single budget last year. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1763.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, he and his fellow Democrats [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1766.96s)]
*  and Biden and Harris, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  they are responsible for all of this. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1770.5600000000002s)]
*  Now, Friday, if the government does shut down, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1773.26s)]
*  this will be on the Schumer radical Democrats. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1776.0600000000002s)]
*  It will be the Schumer shutdown. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1778.5600000000002s)]
*  Schumer lives in fear [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1780.26s)]
*  and is capitulating to a radicalized party [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1781.96s)]
*  that refused to stand for the president at the joint session. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1784.96s)]
*  They wouldn't even stand for the first lady. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1788.86s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for mothers of slain children. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1790.86s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for a young man that survived cancer [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1793.36s)]
*  or the wife of a slain officer. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1796.06s)]
*  And Schumer and Jeffries orchestrated their silly, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1798.1599999999999s)]
*  stupid bingo card paddle response [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1801.06s)]
*  to the president's address to the joint session. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1803.86s)]
*  They can't stand for working men and women. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1806.4599999999998s)]
*  They're not gonna fight for no tax on tips, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1808.76s)]
*  no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1810.76s)]
*  The president has pledged to protect social security, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1813.86s)]
*  Medicaid, Medicare. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1816.76s)]
*  The only thing Schumer and company applauded for [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1818.26s)]
*  was endless war in Europe. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1820.0600000000002s)]
*  That was it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1821.26s)]
*  And now, according to Democrats and their own words, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1822.26s)]
*  all these innocent Americans will suffer [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  because they hate Donald Trump [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1828.0600000000002s)]
*  more than they care about government workers, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1829.76s)]
*  and they will cause the shutdown. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1832.3600000000001s)]
*  But, however, if my memory serves me well, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1834.46s)]
*  if I don't have Joe Biden-itis yet, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1838.5600000000002s)]
*  Democrats used to think that government shutdowns [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1840.96s)]
*  are the worst thing on earth. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1843.66s)]
*  Wow. Now with the pending Schumer shutdown, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1845.56s)]
*  I guess things have changed. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1848.46s)]
*  Let's remind you. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1849.96s)]
*  When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1851.96s)]
*  my state was flooded. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  It was underwater. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1860.96s)]
*  We all knew together that a government shutdown [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1862.66s)]
*  will be devastating, devastating to this country. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1865.66s)]
*  We are now less than a month away [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1869.3600000000001s)]
*  from a potential government shutdown. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1871.46s)]
*  Democrats use a government shutdown as a political tool [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1873.86s)]
*  to protest Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1877.76s)]
*  to defund and dismantle government agencies. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1880.4599999999998s)]
*  The strategy is to do whatever we can to stop Donald Trump. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1882.86s)]
*  So let's end this little monologue, shall we, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1887.6599999999999s)]
*  with another question other than hating Donald Trump. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1889.6599999999999s)]
*  Do Democrats truly believe in anything [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1893.06s)]
*  besides the right of men to play women's sports, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1895.1599999999999s)]
*  the rights of illegal immigrants over the safety of you, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1898.86s)]
*  the American people, the right to waste hundreds [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1901.86s)]
*  and hundreds of billions of dollars abroad [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1904.76s)]
*  on their radical DEI-woke transgender radicalism, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1907.86s)]
*  or that they just have a constant thirst for power [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1912.06s)]
*  using your money for their influence? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DLdvhc0cQ&t=1915.4599999999998s)]
