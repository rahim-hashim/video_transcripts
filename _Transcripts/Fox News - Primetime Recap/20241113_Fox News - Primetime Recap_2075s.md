# Fox News Highlights - Nov. 12, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo)
*  First, leaderless and rudderless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2.84s)]
*  The biggest problem here rests with Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=6.7s)]
*  and his vice presidential candidate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=11.34s)]
*  as to whether they're going to be big enough [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=14.34s)]
*  to accept the results of the election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=16.48s)]
*  This is probably the most important election [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=19.98s)]
*  in our lifetime, and we have to make sure [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=21.86s)]
*  that we get it right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=23.32s)]
*  I'm concerned about what they're gonna do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=24.42s)]
*  Well, those are all fake, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=28.2s)]
*  And as the angle predicted, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=30.34s)]
*  the Democrats were just projecting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=31.66s)]
*  They couldn't deny Trump's win, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=34.06s)]
*  not the size of it this time, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=35.74s)]
*  but they still won't concede in that Pennsylvania [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=37.24s)]
*  Senate race won by Republican Dave McCormick. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=40.64s)]
*  Across our Commonwealth, close to seven million people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  cast their votes in a free and fair election. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Our county election officials will finish [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=50.78s)]
*  counting those votes just like they do in every election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  The American democratic process was born in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  and that process will play out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  It's a shock with that energy level [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  that he didn't immediately get reelected. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=64.42s)]
*  Well, he's just another democratic election denier. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=67.0s)]
*  There's a whole trail of them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=69.1s)]
*  So what happens when the so-called threat to democracy [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=71.36s)]
*  wins a democratic majority? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=74.8s)]
*  Not just the Electoral College, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=76.94s)]
*  but makes historic gains with other groups [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=78.14s)]
*  and wins the popular vote as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=80.38s)]
*  The president is Trump still a threat to democracy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=82.88s)]
*  I'm gonna see him on Wednesday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  And if Trump really had fascistic impulses, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=89.82s)]
*  it would be kind of odd for Biden to have invited him [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=92.46s)]
*  to visit the White House tomorrow, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=95.02s)]
*  Well, of course, that's why this was always [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=97.16s)]
*  a vicious and desperate lie. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  But still the propaganda did have some effect. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=102.46s)]
*  According to AP VoteCast, about two thirds of Harris voters [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=105.6s)]
*  said the future of democracy was the most important factor [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  for their votes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  Apparently groceries didn't matter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=113.63999999999999s)]
*  And nine out of 10 were concerned that electing Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=115.16s)]
*  would bring the country closer to authoritarianism, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=119.0s)]
*  say the people who want us to eat bugs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=121.64s)]
*  Again, all based on lies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=123.6s)]
*  Trump never used the DOJ to attack his political opponents. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=127.14s)]
*  He never flooded the country with illegal immigrants [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=131.28s)]
*  to wipe out your votes or fought against requiring IDs [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=134.02s)]
*  to vote, all of which compromises our democratic system. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=138.06s)]
*  Which is why it should not surprise anyone [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  that the same voter survey also demonstrated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  that one in three Trump voters cited saving democracy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  as their primary motivator. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  And of those, eight in 10 of the Trump voters [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=154.84s)]
*  felt electing Harris would bring the country [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  closer to authoritarianism. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=161.38s)]
*  How interesting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=163.18s)]
*  And given Kamala's own record [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  and her own well-documented views, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=166.66s)]
*  those fears were well-founded. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=169.02s)]
*  Thankfully, enough of you dismissed the anti-Trump smears [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  and saw Harris and her puppet masters for what they are, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=174.44s)]
*  threats to our freedom, to our economy, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  and to our way of life. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=181.0s)]
*  But like mercury, remember when you used to fall [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=183.08s)]
*  out of an old broken thermometer? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=185.18s)]
*  The Democrat machine will reconstitute itself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=187.28s)]
*  And to do that effectively, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=191.18s)]
*  they're wrestling over what went wrong. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=192.84s)]
*  And at times it's gotten fairly brutal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders smashed the out-of-touch party bureaucracy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=198.46s)]
*  that lost the working class, saying in a statement, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=201.92s)]
*  will the big money interests and well-paid consultants [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=204.7s)]
*  who control the Democratic Party [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=207.9s)]
*  learn any real lesson from this disastrous campaign? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=209.78s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=213.68s)]
*  No, that's a safe bet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  But if there is a real effort to redefine the party, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=216.9s)]
*  the progressives, they're worrying about being sidelined. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=221.12s)]
*  And if they are worried, if they are sidelined, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=224.42s)]
*  they have no one but themselves to blame. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=227.1s)]
*  They are all sellouts. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=229.74s)]
*  And Bernie's kind of a sellout too, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=231.62s)]
*  because they compromised their anti-war cred [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=233.82s)]
*  by standing mute when Liz Cheney [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=236.98s)]
*  became Kamala's de facto running mate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=239.72s)]
*  But now they're trashing Democrats [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=242.46s)]
*  who pivot from more radical positions? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=244.18s)]
*  I think that a lot of voters really don't like fake people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=248.02s)]
*  If during the entire time in campaign season, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=254.02s)]
*  you're saying that you're down with trans people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=257.22s)]
*  or the LGBT community, and then you lose an election, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=264.1s)]
*  and then the next day you say all that stuff was wrong. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=268.18s)]
*  I actually think what people are more upset about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=273.58s)]
*  is someone was doing something they didn't believe [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=275.82s)]
*  and just saying something. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=278.18s)]
*  So articulate. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=281.22s)]
*  Now, AOC is grousing about people like Congressman Seth, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=282.54s)]
*  that Seth Moulton, who post-election claimed [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  that his party had gone too extreme, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=288.22s)]
*  saying that I have two little girls, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=290.66s)]
*  I don't want them getting run over on a playing field [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=292.3s)]
*  by a male or a formerly male athlete. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=294.86s)]
*  But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, that kicked off the family feud. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=301.3s)]
*  Grab the popcorn. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  I wonder then what your response was [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  to Congressman Seth Moulton, who suggested this week [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=308.98s)]
*  that Democrats need to change their approach [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=312.38s)]
*  to transgender issues. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  I just find that to be an offensive comment, actually. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=316.26s)]
*  I don't think that just trying to instill fear [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=319.82s)]
*  in joining a party that is instilling people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=323.26s)]
*  is the right way to go about this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=326.7s)]
*  Well, it's about time we saw some cracks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  of the Democrat wall, the monolith, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=331.58s)]
*  past the junior mince. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=334.34s)]
*  I do want to give you a chance to explain your comments [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=336.17999999999995s)]
*  because you know they have faced backlash. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  The backlash I've received proves my point [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=340.26s)]
*  that we can't even have these discussions as a party. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=343.78s)]
*  Instead, we have a wing of our party that shames us, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  that tries to cancel people who even bring up [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=350.06s)]
*  these difficult topics, and frankly shames voters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=352.38s)]
*  Well, given the inroads that Trump has made [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=356.58s)]
*  with young voters, Latino and black voters [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=359.34s)]
*  in urban America, even some in California, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=362.06s)]
*  what the heck can Democrats offer? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=365.5s)]
*  Abortion and saving democracy did not get it done. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=367.9s)]
*  So why will it get it done in 2028? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=371.73999999999995s)]
*  And given the epic failures of policy and messaging, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=375.06s)]
*  who's left in the party with any credibility [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=379.34s)]

*  Now, after the Trump win, House Minority Leader [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=383.94s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries sounded like he's auditioning [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=386.46s)]
*  for something. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  We have problems that we have to solve. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=390.26s)]
*  We've got to make sure, of course, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=392.06s)]
*  that we fix our broken immigration system [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=393.38s)]
*  and we secure the border. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=395.7s)]
*  We have to make sure that we lower costs [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  and grow the middle class. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=398.82000000000005s)]

*  Well, that's a tall order. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=410.66s)]

*  Elon Musk has a seat at the table, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=498.06s)]

*  for veterans on and off the air. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=547.62s)]
*  He's a Princeton and Harvard guy [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=549.82s)]
*  and great husband and father, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=551.26s)]

*  No one loves America more than Pete, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=555.54s)]
*  and no one will defend our interests at home and abroad [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=557.78s)]
*  with more seriousness and strength. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=560.14s)]

*  and the Trump assassination attempts. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=583.74s)]
*  That would rebuild trust with the American people. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=586.14s)]
*  Although I'm not sure if we can expect full transparency [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=589.22s)]

*  DOGE, D-O-G-E. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=615.14s)]
*  Trump likens it to the Manhattan Project, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=619.06s)]

*  in order to better serve the American people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=623.9s)]

*  Right. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=755.66s)]
*  And you'll give your party a better chance to win. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=756.5s)]
*  But they are all, you know, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=760.02s)]
*  holding hands in this circle of denial. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=762.18s)]
*  No, they were part of the cover-up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=764.34s)]
*  If he had walked away, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=765.78s)]
*  it would have been country over self. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=766.98s)]
*  I think people would have admired him for it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=769.8199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it really, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=772.5s)]
*  I'm just, anyway, I've said my piece. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=777.5s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi says the same thing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=780.58s)]
*  It's all Biden's fault. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=782.14s)]
*  But the ladies of The View, they're going to bat for Joe. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=783.74s)]
*  You've got nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=788.1s)]
*  I mean, why, Nancy, why? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=791.1s)]
*  I find this so unproductive, so nasty, so unnecessary. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=792.98s)]
*  It's like, she wants to make sure [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=797.58s)]
*  that people know it wasn't her. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=799.38s)]
*  She has no blame in this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=801.54s)]
*  I said Biden should have gotten out earlier. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=803.38s)]
*  I said there shouldn't have been a primary. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=805.9s)]
*  Don't blame me. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=808.14s)]
*  I think it's really unseemly. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=809.14s)]
*  It's done, folks. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=810.86s)]
*  Donald Trump won and he won decisively. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  Stop blaming Joe Biden. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=814.26s)]
*  Eso es muy feo, muy, muy feo. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=815.74s)]
*  Muy feo. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  Bernie's been running to the cameras telling everybody, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=818.6999999999999s)]
*  eh, eh, eh, I told you so. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=820.74s)]
*  And now AOC is backing him up. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=822.54s)]
*  She's calling Kamala fake. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=824.5799999999999s)]
*  Personally, I don't. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=827.5799999999999s)]
*  I think that a lot of voters really don't like fake people [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=829.54s)]
*  and they're sick and tired of fake politicians. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=836.18s)]
*  And so what I actually think is worse [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=839.22s)]
*  is saying something you don't believe [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=842.1s)]
*  and then you lose an election [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=845.02s)]
*  and then the next day you say all that stuff was wrong. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=846.42s)]
*  I actually think what people are more upset about [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=851.86s)]
*  is someone was doing something they didn't believe [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=854.1s)]
*  and just saying something. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=856.42s)]
*  Like if you actually weren't about that life, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=858.42s)]
*  why did you campaign as though you were? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=862.14s)]
*  Everyone's running away from Harris. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=865.0999999999999s)]
*  And why wouldn't they? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=866.86s)]
*  She burned them for a billion bucks and wasn't even close. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=867.9s)]
*  Her campaign looks like one big fat [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=871.0999999999999s)]
*  money laundering operation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=872.66s)]
*  She was shaking down billionaires to pay millionaires. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  Oprah was forced to admit, yeah, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=878.2199999999999s)]
*  she was paid a million dollars for her Kamala interview. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=880.3399999999999s)]
*  She says, I did not take any personal fee. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=883.2199999999999s)]
*  However, the people who worked on that production [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=886.46s)]
*  needed to be paid and were end of story. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=888.82s)]
*  She's not the only one. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=892.6600000000001s)]
*  Just weeks before Kamala did an interview with Al Sharpton, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=894.02s)]
*  the Harris campaign donated a half a million dollars [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=897.74s)]
*  to Reverend's nonprofit. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=900.7800000000001s)]
*  That's according to the Free Beacon. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=902.86s)]
*  Why is Kamala's presidential campaign funneling 500 grand [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=905.0600000000001s)]
*  to the National Action Network [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=908.58s)]
*  right before an interview with Al, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=910.4200000000001s)]
*  the National Action Network? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=912.34s)]
*  Why is a political campaign bribing Al Sharpton [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=914.62s)]
*  with charitable donations? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=917.34s)]
*  Do you know what Al Sharpton does [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=920.46s)]
*  with money from his nonprofit? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=921.98s)]
*  The Rev in one year spent a million dollars [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=923.54s)]
*  on private jets and limos. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=926.54s)]
*  It's a slush fund for the Reverend and his crew. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=928.54s)]
*  It's been in trouble with the IRS for years for tax evasion. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=931.82s)]
*  And Kamala's like, oh, here you go, take half a mil. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=935.42s)]
*  Imagine if you gave Kamala 500 grand to win Pennsylvania [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=938.7s)]
*  and she's just handed it to Al [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=942.74s)]
*  to take a private jet to Tahiti. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=944.0600000000001s)]
*  Happy DEI Thursday. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=946.54s)]
*  This is the same campaign that the media said was perfect. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=949.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris ran basically a flawless campaign. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=953.62s)]
*  I think because she ran an incredible campaign, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=955.86s)]
*  it's been very telling about who we are. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=958.38s)]
*  She ran a flawless campaign and I maintain that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=960.78s)]
*  This really was an historic, flawlessly run campaign. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=962.94s)]
*  I mean, it was flawless if you were Al Sharpton. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=967.38s)]
*  But the raging Cajun, he's had it up to here. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=970.42s)]
*  And wants the entire Democrat establishment [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=973.18s)]
*  to just do a walk of shame out of Washington [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=975.3399999999999s)]
*  and repent for their sins. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=977.38s)]
*  Justify what you did wrong [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=980.9s)]
*  and tell us what you're going to do different [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=982.9399999999999s)]
*  because what you've done ain't worth it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=985.3s)]
*  All right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=988.6999999999999s)]
*  Get your head around that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=989.9799999999999s)]
*  In all of the Washington based Democrats [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=993.5s)]
*  farting around, going to wine and cheese parties [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=997.02s)]
*  and talking about how misogynistic they said, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=999.74s)]
*  get your ass out of Washington [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1002.38s)]
*  and go work on a 2026 campaign and do penance [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1006.1s)]
*  to make up for your god arrogancy and stupidity. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1011.5s)]
*  All the Democrats can now do is just pray [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1015.58s)]
*  for the second coming. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1017.94s)]
*  Hopefully for them, another Messiah [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1019.54s)]
*  just mysteriously appears out of Hawaii. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1021.1800000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1024.74s)]
*  the 2024 election is in the books and Thanksgiving, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1026.46s)]
*  we have a lot to be thankful for, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  it's just around the corner. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1031.5s)]
*  But unfortunately, some on the radical left, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1033.02s)]
*  they're determined to use the holiday season [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1035.5s)]
*  to take another political stand. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1038.34s)]
*  They want to cast out their own family and close friends. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1040.9s)]
*  I'm not making it up. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1044.46s)]
*  You decide. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1045.94s)]
*  I completely understand her point [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1047.94s)]
*  because I really do feel that this candidate, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1049.98s)]
*  you know, president elect Trump [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1053.3s)]
*  is just a different type of candidate. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1055.42s)]
*  From the things he said and the things he's done [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1058.26s)]
*  and the things he will do, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1061.3s)]
*  it's more of a moral issue for me. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1062.9s)]
*  Don't want to be at Thanksgiving dinner with her, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1066.42s)]
*  probably turkey legs, mashed potatoes being thrown around. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1068.34s)]
*  Anyway, tonight, we're gonna take a step back. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1072.1s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pinsky is gonna join us with advice [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1075.1s)]
*  how to navigate what will be a very challenging [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1078.1399999999999s)]
*  holiday season for so many families with loved ones [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1081.06s)]
*  who are totally consumed with Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1084.5s)]
*  But while hysteria continues on the left, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1088.06s)]
*  Donald Trump is getting to work big time, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1090.1799999999998s)]
*  breaking only moments ago. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1092.58s)]
*  Donald Trump announced that our good friend [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1093.9399999999998s)]
*  and our colleague, Pete Hegseth, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1095.82s)]

*  Now, Pete is an Army veteran. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1100.74s)]
*  He served in Iraq, he served in Afghanistan. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1102.5s)]
*  He also earned two bronze stars. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1104.82s)]
*  He also holds degrees from Princeton and Harvard [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1108.46s)]
*  and has made it his life's work to advocate [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1111.42s)]
*  for our veterans and active duty service members. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1114.22s)]
*  His passion is and has always been the US military [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1117.06s)]
*  and that I know is a fact. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1121.18s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1123.34s)]
*  The president elect also announced that Elon Musk [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1124.18s)]
*  and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the new department [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1127.1399999999999s)]

*  the president-elect is not ruling it out [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1266.7s)]

*  On the campaign trail, President Trump said [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1274.66s)]
*  he wouldn't take it off the books, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1277.14s)]
*  despite the egregious lawfare by the Biden administration [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1278.54s)]
*  and the fact that Hunter is, quote, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1283.22s)]
*  a bad guy or a bad boy, to quote him exactly. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1284.7s)]
*  Now, Melania Trump, on the other hand, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1288.06s)]
*  well, is not quite as forgiving, and I don't blame her. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1290.3s)]
*  According to the New York Post, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1293.1399999999999s)]
*  she declined an invitation to meet with Dr. Jill Biden tomorrow, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1294.46s)]

*  authorized by the weaponized Department of Justice [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1302.06s)]

*  Jill Biden's husband authorized the FBI snooping [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1312.74s)]
*  through her underwear drawer, and the Bidens are disgusting. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1315.66s)]
*  And Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, remember this, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1319.66s)]
*  they both had top secret classified information. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1322.14s)]
*  Joe had it in four separate locations. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1324.98s)]
*  Their homes were not invaded. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1327.78s)]
*  Donald Trump never had used bleach pit [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1330.18s)]
*  or used hammers and removed SIM cards [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1333.42s)]
*  and broke up devices. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1335.78s)]
*  But this weaponization of justice must forever, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1337.46s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, end. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1341.5s)]
*  It has got to stop the DOJ, the FBI being politicized, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1343.42s)]
*  Intel agencies politicized. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1348.3s)]
*  They now need to return forever [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1350.94s)]
*  to their original non-political purpose [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1353.7s)]
*  and their former greatness. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1356.78s)]
*  That has got to be the goal, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1358.42s)]
*  but the Bidens will soon be out of the White House [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1359.94s)]
*  once and for all. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1362.02s)]
*  And on January 20th, 2025, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1363.26s)]
*  the reckoning will begin in the Washington swamp. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  The monolithic far left city [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1369.14s)]
*  that does not represent the whole of America [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1371.14s)]
*  is about to be rocked to its core. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1373.46s)]
*  But despite the fear mongering on the left, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1375.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is not threatening democracy. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1377.82s)]
*  He's not threatening our constitution. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1380.22s)]
*  America's massive bureaucracy, on the other hand, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1382.58s)]
*  will soon face a very heavy dose of reality. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1385.38s)]
*  Again, this is not going to be business as usual. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1388.7s)]
*  That is not what the American people voted for. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1392.14s)]
*  The decentralization of power, as our founders intended, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1395.0200000000002s)]
*  is very much on its way to DC. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1399.1000000000001s)]
*  And the new Department of Government Efficiency [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1401.7s)]
*  will take an ax to government waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1404.46s)]
*  In fact, Trump now plans to eliminate [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1408.0200000000002s)]
*  the entire Department of Education, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1410.0600000000002s)]
*  send that money directly to the states. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1412.22s)]
*  They would better know how to use it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1415.26s)]
*  Other departments like the EPA [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1416.98s)]
*  and the Bureau of Land Management [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  can soon be relocated outside of the Washington swamp [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1422.9s)]
*  and expect to see a major overhaul of the DOJ, DHS, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1425.74s)]
*  and the FBI's Washington Field Office. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1429.66s)]
*  Government agencies have been unaccountable [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1432.3s)]
*  and frankly out of control for far too long. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1434.94s)]
*  And a pervasive far left bias has tarnished [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1437.74s)]
*  America's once great institutions. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1440.54s)]

*  the president must do [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1458.86s)]

*  The border, it must be secured immediately. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1465.52s)]
*  Millions of criminal illegal immigrants, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1468.78s)]

*  those that are known terrorists, they must be found. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1478.9s)]
*  They must be deported. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1482.52s)]
*  Peace, law, and order must be restored in every small town [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1484.38s)]
*  and every big city and around the world. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1488.46s)]
*  America must now lead the way with energy dominance, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1491.0400000000002s)]
*  innovation, development. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1494.26s)]

*  Trump can and will restore the American dream [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1501.26s)]
*  and get government off of your back. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  It's called freedom. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1506.26s)]
*  For far too long, Democratic elites in Washington, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1507.62s)]

*  I'm scared. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1766.46s)]
*  He scares me, and I'm a citizen. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1768.46s)]

*  over the past four years, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1781.46s)]

*  his fifth grandchild. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1785.46s)]
*  They got debit cards, hotel rooms, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1791.46s)]

*  No less. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1796.98s)]
*  Hell, even I would take the sex change. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1798.98s)]
*  I mean, it's free. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1800.98s)]
*  I don't want it, but it's free. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1804.98s)]
*  Like free stuff. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1807.98s)]
*  But if they listen to the incoming president then, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1809.98s)]
*  and he didn't even speak English, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1811.98s)]
*  I bet they'll listen to this one now. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1813.98s)]

*  As always, with language. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1829.5s)]

*  mass deportations, he wasn't being serious. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1853.02s)]
*  He was absolutely serious. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1855.02s)]
*  What it means is grandmothers. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1857.02s)]
*  What it means is brothers and aunts. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1859.02s)]
*  What it means is abuelos y abuelas. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1861.02s)]

*  I'm like, I'm not dreaming about that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1875.02s)]

*  It's not deportations, it's mass deportations. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1883.02s)]
*  Emphasis on mass. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1885.02s)]
*  They've done this before. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1887.02s)]
*  When the left created hate speech, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1889.02s)]
*  it was to go after speech by leading with hate. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1891.02s)]
*  When they came up with the assault rifle, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1893.02s)]
*  it was to go after the gun while playing up the assault. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1895.02s)]
*  And here it's [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1897.02s)]
*  distract from deportation by playing up the mass. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1899.02s)]
*  Which raises a question. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1903.02s)]
*  Can the media tell us the cutoff [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1905.02s)]
*  between mass and not mass? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1907.02s)]
*  Have they ever given us the difference between mass [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1909.72s)]
*  and just regular old deportations? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1912.36s)]
*  They never did the math. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1914.84s)]
*  Then again, no one ever asks. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1916.6s)]
*  And most of them can't count higher [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  than the number of their remaining refills for Zoloft. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1920.2s)]
*  Somehow it wasn't mass deportations when Obama did it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1925.44s)]
*  You didn't hear the cattle at the view calling him a fascist. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1930.0s)]
*  Then again, it's hard to understand people [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1933.54s)]
*  when they have a mouthful of field grass. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1935.24s)]
*  So what's the answer, all you smarty pants? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1940.9s)]
*  How many people do you allow in every year? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1942.92s)]
*  Personally, I say 500, and they must know deep tissue massage [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1945.98s)]
*  and look great in athletic gear. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1949.96s)]
*  But the number can change every year [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1953.92s)]
*  based on what the country needs and what it can handle. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1955.92s)]
*  It's not a people question, it's an economic one. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1958.4s)]
*  Everything in life has limits and amounts. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1961.7s)]
*  You don't pour a 12-ounce beer into a shot glass, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1963.98s)]
*  and you don't squeeze a circus bear [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1967.32s)]
*  into a size two pair of overalls. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1969.26s)]
*  Now, we know that the left understands limits. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1978.5s)]
*  In California, with smash and grab thefts, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1982.68s)]
*  they created a $950 threshold. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1985.3400000000001s)]
*  If you didn't exceed it, then it was only a misdemeanor. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1988.3400000000001s)]
*  That's why in California, my book costs $951. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1991.3s)]
*  It's odd, the left are happy to decide [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1994.74s)]
*  how much of a bad thing we could endure, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=1999.04s)]
*  but they're flummoxed by good behavior. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2002.22s)]
*  So just for kicks, ask someone, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2005.12s)]
*  what's the number you're okay with? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2007.22s)]
*  They can't give you one, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2009.56s)]
*  because they hold your beliefs to absurd standards. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2010.86s)]
*  When the left gets into power under the guise of centrism, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2013.92s)]
*  they move easily to the left. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2017.42s)]
*  When the right gains power under the same promise [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2020.16s)]
*  of centrism, they cannot move to the right at all, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2022.72s)]
*  which means any action to gain control of the border [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2026.64s)]
*  will be defined as intolerable, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2029.8400000000001s)]
*  even if it's pure common sense, which is good news for us. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2031.98s)]
*  We realize nothing we do will be popular, and that's freeing. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2035.5400000000002s)]
*  AOC can cry, the media can call us fascists, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2039.74s)]
*  we don't give a f***. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-iN8GhdiYo&t=2043.3600000000001s)]
