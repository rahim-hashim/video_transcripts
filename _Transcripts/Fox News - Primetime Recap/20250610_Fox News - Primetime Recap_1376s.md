# Fox News Highlights - June 9th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI)
*  All right, and now, coming to a blue state near you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=3.68s)]
*  Well, they do call it the city of angels. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if this is how angels conduct themselves. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=10.28s)]
*  Burning down! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=13.16s)]
*  Burning down! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=14.26s)]
*  Burning down! [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=15.36s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=16.8s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=18.8s)]
*  F***er! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=20.04s)]
*  I love the skateboard. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=35.24s)]
*  Now, the scenes are all so familiar, aren't they? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=37.0s)]
*  The Mexican flag flying proudly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=39.92s)]
*  The verbal taunts of law enforcement. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=43.16s)]
*  Why are you covering your face, bro? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=46.12s)]
*  You trying to f***ing hide from the f***ing government? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=47.12s)]
*  You're gonna block this motherf***er. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=49.72s)]
*  No! [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=51.72s)]
*  Get back! [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=52.72s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=53.72s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=54.72s)]
*  Get back! [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=55.72s)]
*  What the f***? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=56.72s)]
*  Get back! [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=57.72s)]
*  The printed signs with focus group tested slogans. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  So tedious. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=63.72s)]
*  Oh, of course, the masks as Bill referenced covering the faces of all the proud protesters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=64.72s)]
*  It's also legitimate why they're covering their faces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=71.52s)]
*  Well, seeing the destruction in the past 72 hours, President Trump has sent in all [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=74.72s)]
*  those Marines that Bill referenced to protect federal buildings in LA. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=79.32s)]
*  So rather than thanking the president for helping out, LA Mayor Karen Bass and Governor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=83.56s)]
*  Gavin Newsom blame Trump for escalating things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=88.76s)]
*  Well, the Marines are stationed nearby, and so we already have the military in our midst. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=92.44s)]
*  But I really think we need to go back and look at norms and look at what policies and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=98.36s)]
*  laws actually are. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=103.1s)]
*  Because I think the thing that is challenging in this administration is that you don't know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  where the line is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  You don't know where the line is? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  She wouldn't know how to get from A to B if her life depended on it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=112.38s)]
*  All you need to know is that Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom simply do not care what happens [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  to LA. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=124.46s)]
*  I mean, the Hollywood sign could be burning, Beverly Hills could be burned down, and as [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=125.46s)]
*  long as their views align with the views of the protesters, it's okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=130.38s)]
*  Democrats in power would tolerate it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=135.98s)]
*  If you're a criminal and you hate Trump, or again, if you're lined up with a liberal cause, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=138.5s)]
*  Le Cause de Jure, you will be protected somehow, some way. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=143.54s)]
*  And many of you were asking, a lot of you came up to me over the weekend, who has time [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=148.18s)]
*  to protest? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=152.18s)]
*  Aren't these people working? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=153.18s)]
*  And who's really the man or the men and women behind the curtain pulling everyone together [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=156.08s)]
*  here? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, some of the groups involved include Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights LA, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  otherwise known as CHRLA. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=169.56s)]
*  This is one of the biggies. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=171.74s)]
*  It's a rabid open borders front organization. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=173.0s)]
*  It demands amnesty for all 11 million illegals, more like 20 million. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=176.18s)]
*  But what will really burn you up about this group is the fact that over the years, it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=181.5s)]
*  received more than $45 million in government grants for its immigrant rights work. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=185.3s)]
*  Yeah, your money. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=193.02s)]
*  It's so radical, in fact, that it lost funding from the government more than a year ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=194.66s)]
*  In other words, they were even too crazy for the Biden people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=199.02s)]
*  The New York Post cites the PSLAS as co-organizers of these anti-ICE actions and riots. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=202.8s)]
*  They're promising more in the coming months. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=211.58s)]
*  It's a socialist organization. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=214.52s)]
*  And then there's the Union del Barrio. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=216.64s)]
*  It's spearheading the so-called Community Self-Defense Coalition. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=219.34s)]
*  It's a network of 50 to 80 groups that train volunteers to identify and block ICE raids. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=223.52s)]
*  It uses bullhorns to warn migrants. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=230.36s)]
*  It patrols communities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=232.56s)]
*  And it even does what's called self-defense training. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=234.2s)]
*  We imagine that's defending themselves against law enforcement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=238.26s)]
*  Now, these coalitions were reportedly on site during raids and frequently got into it with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=241.58s)]
*  law enforcement and federal agents. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=246.36s)]
*  And finally, on the list of four or five, the old standby, Antifa and other far-left elements. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=248.1s)]
*  Now of course, civil unrest and violence is their stock and trade, Antifa. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=255.7s)]
*  And many of those, of course, spray painting the storefronts over the weekend and the vehicles. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=259.68s)]
*  If you're online, you saw a lot of this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  They leave behind the tedious Antifa logo with a circle around it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=266.26s)]
*  How clever. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, they're basically scattered throughout the protest and they tend to egg people on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  Bill talked about the people in the kind of black block uniform. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  That's who the Antifa crowd usually is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  So you think about this group that I just listed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  This is a great bunch to be associated with, right, if you're a politician? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=284.4s)]
*  Well, what's insane about this is that the Democrats actually think this works for them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=289.4s)]
*  In fact, they think it's a winning formula. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=295.4s)]
*  Now remember back in 2020, another blue city devolved into chaos because Governor Tim [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=298.08s)]
*  Walz, thanks Tim, and Mayor Jacob Frey were more interested in understanding the pain [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=302.4s)]
*  of the protesters than restoring and protecting, restoring law and order and protecting businesses [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=308.9s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=315.08s)]
*  And as we all remember, things got totally out of hand and really fast. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  The thugs who burned down the third police precinct, who destroyed businesses owned by [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  the locals. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  We interviewed a bunch of them at the time in the aftermath. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  These protesters didn't care about George Floyd. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=330.42s)]
*  They weren't fretting about police brutality. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=333.58s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=336.18s)]
*  They exploited a tragic situation to loot and to raise hell. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  And the agitators hoping that it would spread to other cities at the time, they worked hard. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=343.3s)]
*  And remember, it did spread to other cities with deadly results from Wisconsin to Seattle [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  to Portland to Chicago to New York. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=355.74s)]
*  We saw it across the line. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  And also here in D.C. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=361.18s)]
*  I was actually at one of those protests undercover. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=362.18s)]
*  And after all of that destruction and the lives lost, you have to ask, what did they [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=365.82s)]
*  accomplish? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=370.9s)]
*  Oh, nothing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=371.9s)]
*  Except maybe some of the race hustlers got rich and the DEI scam got a huge boost. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=373.74s)]
*  But it's the same situation now with the anti-ice protests. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=380.24s)]
*  None of these people, and I mean none of them, not a single one of them really care about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=384.02000000000004s)]
*  these communities or the plight of migrants. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=389.14s)]
*  Because if they did, they'd know what a nightmare an open border has been to all people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=392.64s)]
*  The cartels got rich and women and children got trafficked. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=398.42s)]
*  The truth is, the organizers of the chaos, they don't believe that our federal government [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  is legitimate, especially when it's led by Donald Trump. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=408.5s)]
*  And they do not feel obliged to follow any of our laws. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=413.28s)]
*  And I mean any of them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=416.73999999999995s)]
*  And Biden and Mayorkas, they basically tacitly agreed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  They opened the border and they gave benefits to 10 million illegal aliens. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=423.76s)]
*  The goal, well, made a lot of those protesters happy, right, those organizations. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=428.11999999999995s)]
*  But the goal was to resettle America with new people in order to transform it completely [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=433.44s)]
*  in ways that you really can't do at the ballot box, at least when you're not that radical, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=438.67999999999995s)]
*  when you're that radical. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=442.84s)]
*  So what they essentially believe is that all of us need to do penance for the sins of taking [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  this land from native people, for slavery, for what we did to women, and so on and so [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  forth. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=455.2s)]
*  And by the way, the penance never ends. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=456.2s)]
*  The riots are happening because the people and the groups involved know they're going [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=460.52s)]
*  to get away with it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=464.88s)]
*  They know that the governor and the mayor are on their side. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=466.44s)]
*  Notice they don't try this nonsense in states like Texas, in Florida, in Mississippi, in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  Louisiana, or in Virginia. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=476.08s)]
*  But with the right political climate, with liberals in charge, they'll eventually find [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=479.23999999999995s)]
*  an excuse to create a civil uprising. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, we're not far from Virginia here. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=486.2s)]
*  If Virginia voters elect Democrat Abigail Spanberger, the moderate Democrat liberal, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  who always votes for the liberals, governor in November, I'm telling you, all you Virginians, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=497.16s)]
*  all bets are off. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  This is what you're voting for. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=504.0s)]
*  And if Republicans lose the midterms in a year from now, a year and a half from now, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=506.24s)]
*  this is going to start blowing up everywhere. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=511.16s)]
*  And House Democrats will begin nonstop investigations into Trump world. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  And if Hakeem Jeffries is Speaker of the House, he'll encourage more of this stuff with his [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  pronouncements about Trump the dictator. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=522.32s)]
*  You can see it coming with left-wing chaos, with its Marxist aims rolling right into 2028. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=525.64s)]
*  Mark my words, as my late mom used to say. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=533.72s)]
*  So this is the time for voters to speak up and to put an end to this once and for all. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=537.12s)]
*  We can't reason with these people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=542.16s)]
*  We can only beat them. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=544.16s)]
*  And I mean beat them badly in the polls. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=545.6s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=549.32s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=551.44s)]
*  Chaos in Los Angeles. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=556.48s)]
*  Stores looted, cars burnt to a crisp and American flags torched. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=558.24s)]
*  Anarchists and dirt bikes are waving Mexican flags around LA while the city's engulfed [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=562.84s)]
*  in flames. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=567.6s)]
*  And they love this country so much that they're waving the flag. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  So why do they hate the idea of being sent back? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=574.2s)]
*  This doesn't look like assimilation. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=577.24s)]
*  This looks like what it is. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=579.36s)]
*  An invasion. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=580.92s)]
*  This all started Friday afternoon. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  ICE agents were assisting a federal drug and money laundering raid in downtown LA when all [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=584.6s)]
*  of a sudden dozens of protesters showed up and clashed with officers on the scene. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=590.08s)]
*  The mayor of Los Angeles didn't stop it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=596.2s)]
*  She told LAPD to stand down for hours and hung federal agents out to dry. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=599.14s)]
*  Karen Bass told Trump, keep your hands off my Biden migrants. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  We are going to fight for all Angelenos, regardless of when they got here, whether they have papers [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=611.32s)]
*  or not. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=617.6s)]
*  We are a city of immigrants and this impacts hundreds of thousands of Angelenos. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=618.64s)]
*  While rioters were raising hell, Democrats chose sides. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=624.88s)]
*  I skipped the audit of LA so that order kept being stored. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=629.1600000000001s)]
*  If they're escalating their tactics, then so are we. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=633.12s)]
*  When they show up, we got to show up even stronger. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=636.6s)]
*  By Saturday morning, cop cars were getting pelted with rocks and officers had to start [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=644.52s)]
*  deploying tear gas. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=649.48s)]
*  The media told us, don't worry, the protests are mostly peaceful. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=651.2s)]
*  Most of the crowds again that I saw, that I spoke to, that I was interacting with, these [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=656.44s)]
*  These are peaceful people that want to get their message across. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  Most of those demonstrations were very peaceful. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  The reality is we see peaceful protests launching in Los Angeles. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=666.14s)]
*  What did happen in 1992 was so different from what we're seeing now. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=671.76s)]
*  I mean, that was, that was a, a real, a real riot. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=675.5s)]
*  What about the cars on fire? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=680.8199999999999s)]
*  ABC says it's just people having fun. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  There's a large group of people. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=686.74s)]
*  It could turn very volatile if you move law enforcement in there in the wrong way and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=688.5s)]
*  turn what is just a bunch of people having fun watching cars burn into a massive confrontation [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=692.74s)]
*  and altercation between officers and, and demonstrators. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=699.82s)]
*  No police weren't having fun. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=704.22s)]
*  The chief of LA County says he was outmanned. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=706.1s)]
*  We are overwhelmed as far as the number of people out there engaged in this type of activity [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=710.46s)]
*  and the type of things that they're doing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  They'll, they'll take backpacks and the backpack will have a cinder block in it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=718.14s)]
*  They have a hammer and they'll break up the cinder block and use that, pass it around [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=722.98s)]
*  to throw at officers, to throw at cars and throw at other people. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=726.58s)]
*  By six o'clock on Saturday, the city was on fire and Trump had to call in 2000 National [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=730.74s)]
*  Guard for backup. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  Now it's up to 4000. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=738.0s)]
*  Trump didn't wait for permission from the governor like the last summer of love. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=740.02s)]
*  Now there's a new policy. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=744.46s)]
*  When they spit, we hit. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=746.2s)]
*  If we see danger to our country and to our citizens, we'll be very, very strong in terms [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=748.0s)]
*  of law and order. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=753.52s)]
*  It's about law and order. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=754.52s)]
*  When they spit at people, you know, they spit. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=757.52s)]
*  That's their new thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=763.58s)]
*  They spit and worse, you know what? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=764.58s)]
*  They throw at them, right? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=765.58s)]
*  And when that happens, I have a little statement they say they spit, we hit. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=766.58s)]
*  to spit, we hit. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=769.1s)]
*  And I told him, nobody's gonna spit on our police officers. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=771.5s)]
*  Nobody's gonna spit on our military. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=775.46s)]
*  Protesters liked spitting, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=778.46s)]
*  but they didn't like getting hit. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=779.82s)]
*  But you told me you got caught up in the tear gas as well. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=782.5400000000001s)]
*  Describe what happened to you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=784.98s)]
*  Oh, just tasted a little tear gas. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=787.34s)]
*  Tasted like fascism. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=790.9s)]
*  The media rushed to blame Trump. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=792.5s)]
*  Didn't really reach this point of the scale [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=796.1s)]
*  and the intensity of this protest [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=798.98s)]
*  and the scale and the intensity of the confrontation [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=800.26s)]
*  between protesters and law enforcement [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=802.26s)]
*  until National Guard troops were deployed here today. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=804.02s)]
*  That very much poured gasoline on the flames [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=807.38s)]
*  and that very much led to the LAPD acting [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=809.74s)]
*  in as widespread and aggressive a manner [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=813.1s)]
*  as we saw them acting today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=816.5s)]
*  Now the press said everything was mostly peaceful [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=818.58s)]
*  until the National Guard showed up. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=821.14s)]
*  But the New York Times is reporting the National Guard [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=823.28s)]
*  hasn't even engaged with the protesters at all. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=826.9s)]
*  National Guard troops appeared to largely refrain [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=830.1s)]
*  from engaging with demonstrators. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=833.14s)]
*  So that debunks the hoax that Trump incited the riots. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=835.38s)]
*  Karen Bass, who told cops to stand down, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=839.78s)]
*  said the streets weren't really dangerous [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=843.02s)]
*  until Trump mobilized the Guard. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=844.78s)]
*  What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=847.6999999999999s)]
*  that is provoked by the administration. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=850.34s)]
*  When you run armored caravans through our streets, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=852.3s)]
*  you cause fear and you cause panic. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=855.54s)]
*  And deploying federalized troops is a dangerous escalation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=858.26s)]
*  Even Kamala Waiten saying deploying National Guard [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=863.06s)]
*  is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=866.16s)]
*  Yeah, the guy who ran on law and order [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=870.06s)]
*  wants to provoke chaos. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=872.14s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=874.3s)]
*  Democrats are trying to frame Trump [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  as a heavy-handed dictator, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=877.92s)]
*  even though the city was on fire before he sent the Guard in. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=879.86s)]
*  Newsom, who could have called up the Guard himself, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=883.24s)]
*  is suing Trump for protecting his state. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=886.36s)]
*  Fox News is calling it the L.A. riots. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=889.88s)]
*  Is it a peaceful protest? What's happening? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=891.96s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=893.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, Donald Trump has created [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=894.38s)]
*  the conditions you see on your TV tonight. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=896.96s)]

*  The question you have to ask yourself is, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=1341.3400000000001s)]
*  is the civilization worth saving? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBgh_r1PJvI&t=1343.42s)]
