# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 15, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU)
*  Ingram, this is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2.6s)]
*  Kamala's demeaning pitch to black men. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=5.34s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=8.72s)]
*  A five point plan including weed and money [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=14.06s)]
*  is how Kamala thinks she's gonna win over the black voters [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=17.34s)]
*  that she's losing, but they're smarter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=20.06s)]
*  than she thinks they are. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=22.6s)]
*  What would you say to the people that would consider [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=24.6s)]
*  the timing of this proposal as political timing? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=27.18s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for your question [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=31.22s)]
*  and for being here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  I've been in this race about 70 days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=35.86s)]
*  You can look at all my work before those 70 days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=38.58s)]
*  to know that this, what I'm talking about right now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=41.08s)]
*  is not new and is not for the sake of winning this election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=47.14s)]
*  Now many years ago when I clerked [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=49.6s)]
*  for Justice Clarence Thomas, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=51.06s)]
*  I learned that there is nothing that bothers liberals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=52.7s)]
*  I mean, really bothers them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=56.5s)]
*  Bothers them more than minorities who think for themselves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=58.74s)]
*  And that means right now they are spinning [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=63.3s)]
*  over new data coming out about black views [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=65.78s)]
*  on Trump versus Harris. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=68.26s)]
*  And the bottom line is this, at this particular hour, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=70.58s)]
*  if you believe the polling, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=72.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's gonna put up the best performance [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=74.22s)]
*  with black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=75.9s)]
*  Not 68 since 1960, that's 64 years ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=79.22s)]
*  Now he still only gets what 15% or so the black vote [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=83.34s)]
*  according to the New York Times poll, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=87.78s)]
*  but that's a 67% improving of the support he got in 2020. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  And it's double what he got in 2016, that's called progress. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  But rather than try to figure out what Trump is saying, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=100.14s)]
*  what he did previously that resonates, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=104.22s)]
*  Kamala Harris recites lines written for her [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  by her consultants. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=109.5s)]
*  Nothing substantive, just trash talk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  Look at it in the context of how he actually thinks [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  and talks about black folks in America. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  This man is dangerous, not to mention Roland. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=119.82s)]
*  Let's fast forward to right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=124.22s)]
*  He, his staff won't let him do a 60 minutes interview. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  Now, hold the laughter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=131.34s)]
*  This from a woman who hid for most of the campaign [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  and still hasn't held a press conference, nice try. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=138.06s)]
*  Now, according to Fox News power rankings, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  Kamala's decline among men, Hispanics and black voters, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  especially could be decisive factors [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=148.5s)]
*  in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=151.18s)]
*  Now that's why Obama embarrassed himself last week, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  lecturing black man, that's still my favorite thing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=157.34s)]
*  of all last week, about how if they don't vote for Kamala, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=159.78s)]
*  they'll be considered essentially [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  just a bunch of idiot sexists. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=165.82s)]
*  He backfired big time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=168.34s)]
*  He also threatened to bring Michelle to lecture them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=170.02s)]
*  So how does Kamala win back black men? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=173.3s)]
*  Now, with a serious plan, I imagine, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=177.1s)]
*  to ditch by dynamics and grow the economy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=179.0s)]
*  so black men have the jobs that they deserve, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=181.34s)]
*  or perhaps with a pledge to seal the border once and for all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=184.58s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=188.3s)]
*  Instead, she's dangling goodies [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=189.62s)]
*  that she knows she could never deliver on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=191.96s)]
*  She went on with Charlamagne the God this afternoon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=194.86s)]
*  I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=198.58s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, meaning history. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=204.62s)]
*  On the plane of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=208.18s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=210.44000000000003s)]
*  But wait, there's more. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=212.78000000000003s)]
*  She says she's gonna fight for 1 million forgivable loans [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=214.58s)]
*  to black entrepreneurs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=219.18s)]
*  Now, aside from the fact that that's totally unconstitutional, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=221.3s)]
*  of course that's never stopped them before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=224.74s)]
*  And if none of that works, she hopes that they're gonna [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  feel better about the crappy economy and dangerous streets [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  if they at least know they can smoke weed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=233.94s)]
*  and not be thrown in federal prison. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=236.86s)]
*  What public defenders who are around those days [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=239.34s)]
*  will tell you, I was the most progressive prosecutor [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=242.22s)]
*  in California on marijuana cases. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=245.78s)]
*  And as vice president, have been a champion [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  for bringing marijuana down on the schedule. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=252.42s)]
*  So instead of it being ranked up there with heroin, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=254.7s)]
*  we bring it down and my pledge is as president, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=257.28s)]
*  I will work on decriminalizing it because I know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=260.26s)]
*  exactly how those laws have been used [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=263.58s)]
*  to disproportionately impact certain populations [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=265.9s)]
*  and specifically black men. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=269.44s)]
*  Well, didn't she already do that when she was a prosecutor? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=271.74s)]
*  Did she already throw a bunch of people in jail for weed? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=274.18s)]
*  Well, she also added on her campaign website, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=277.74s)]
*  the typical gibberish about equity and price gouging [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=280.14s)]
*  on food and groceries. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=284.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's the same recycled proposal [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=286.34s)]
*  that has been roundly ridiculed even by Democrat economists. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=288.28s)]
*  So this all smacks of unseriousness [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=293.78s)]
*  and frankly desperation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, Obama again acted like black men were misogynists [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=298.32s)]
*  for not supporting Kamala. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=301.7s)]
*  And now Kamala is treating black men like they're too stupid [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=303.82s)]
*  to recognize a con artist when they see one. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=307.9s)]
*  As Barack Obama said, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=310.82s)]
*  Kamala Harris has an issue with the brothers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=312.38s)]
*  You texted me right around the Democratic convention [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=315.38s)]
*  and you said, I am talking to people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=318.26s)]
*  and Kamala Harris has a problem with black men. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I told the campaign, I did not hear from them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=323.38s)]
*  I mean, who am I for them to get back to me? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=326.17999999999995s)]
*  But there's a problem. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  I went up to people just doing man on the street. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=329.58s)]
*  It's who are you gonna vote for? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=332.26s)]
*  Black men and time after time after time, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  they said, I'm voting for Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=335.82s)]
*  Kamala was supposed to be the pantsuit Messiah, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=338.06s)]
*  but she's really more of an actress. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=341.18s)]
*  When he was asked about what he was gonna do, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=343.98s)]
*  he says he's got concepts of a plan for how he'd replace it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=348.86s)]
*  He has no plan to replace it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=354.53999999999996s)]
*  You guys watched the debate. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=360.42s)]
*  Right, he has quote concepts of a plan, concepts. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=362.14s)]
*  Kamala is imitating Barack, but there's one problem. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=370.94s)]
*  She's more like Hillary and the streets know it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=374.02s)]
*  There's nothing about the poll numbers [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=377.82s)]
*  that we're seeing right now [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=379.7s)]
*  that shouldn't make anybody feel like she got this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember those poll numbers with Hillary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=382.74s)]
*  Remember those poll numbers with Hillary [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=384.18s)]
*  and I keep telling people this campaign [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=385.38s)]
*  feels more Hillaryish than it does Obamaish. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=387.18s)]
*  Obama-o-itis. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=391.78s)]
*  When Hillary was in trouble with the black vote, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  Democrats closed their eyes and prayed for the God to save her. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=395.38s)]
*  That's Charlamagne the God. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=399.58s)]
*  But then Hillary pulled out the hot sauce. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  What's something that you always carry with you? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=404.38s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=408.05999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=408.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=409.73999999999995s)]
*  Are you getting information right now? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=410.58s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=411.9s)]
*  Hot sauce in my bag swag? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=417.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  Now listen, I want you to know people are gonna see this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=418.82s)]
*  and say, okay, she's pandering the black people. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=422.54s)]
*  Is it working? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=423.38000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=424.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=425.06s)]
*  No, seriously, hot sauce. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  I've been eating a lot of hot sauce. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=427.94s)]
*  A lot of raw peppers and hot sauce. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=430.94s)]
*  Then Democrats tried it again. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=434.18s)]
*  They sent Biden in and he told them, you ain't black. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=436.5s)]
*  It's a long way until November. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  We got more questions. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=442.1s)]
*  You got more questions. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=443.94000000000005s)]
*  But I tell you what, if you have a problem [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  figuring out whether you're for me or for the people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=446.18s)]
*  that you're for, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=448.94000000000005s)]
*  you got a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=449.78s)]
*  and you ain't black. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=452.5s)]
*  No. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=454.02s)]
*  So Barack sent Harris to see the God, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  hoping the third time's a charm. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=457.61999999999995s)]
*  Harris spent all day prepping for Charlemagne, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=459.7s)]
*  cleared her whole schedule for one interview at five o'clock. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  The first question Charlemagne asked her, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  do you ever say anything new? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=468.9s)]
*  Well, what do you say to people who say [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  you stay on the talking points? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=472.5s)]
*  I would say you're welcome. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=474.14s)]
*  I mean, listen, here's the thing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=476.7s)]
*  I love having conversations, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=479.26000000000005s)]
*  which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=480.66s)]
*  And the reality is that there are certain things [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=492.5s)]
*  in this election. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=495.3s)]
*  And so it requires repetition. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=496.5s)]
*  Some people say that until someone has heard the same thing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  at least three times, it just doesn't stay with you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=501.94000000000005s)]
*  So repetition is important. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=504.82000000000005s)]
*  Kamala thinks voters are too ignorant [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=506.66s)]
*  to get her message through their thick skulls. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=508.54s)]
*  She has to repeat it like a hypnotist. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=511.18s)]
*  And it's not even working because no one ever knows [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=514.1s)]
*  what she's talking about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=516.74s)]
*  This was kind of a virtual town hall [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=518.66s)]
*  with voters who called in and they wanted to know, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=520.62s)]
*  where's my money you promised? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=523.78s)]
*  My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=526.38s)]
*  I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=536.02s)]
*  meaning history to your point. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=538.66s)]
*  So my agenda, well, first of all, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  on the plane of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=544.02s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=546.3s)]
*  As it relates to the economy, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=547.8199999999999s)]
*  which is a lot of what you have addressed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  Look, I grew up in the middle class. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=552.6199999999999s)]
*  My mother worked hard, raised me and my sister. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=555.26s)]
*  And by the time I was in high school, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=558.06s)]
*  she was able to afford our first home. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=560.3399999999999s)]
*  I know what it means for an individual [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=562.94s)]
*  and a family to have home ownership. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=565.2600000000001s)]
*  Translation, you're not getting reparations. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=567.6600000000001s)]
*  I wanna give you reparations, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=570.3800000000001s)]
*  but they told me I can't say that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  What I can say is that I grew up in the middle class. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=573.9000000000001s)]
*  Black men have been asking, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=577.98s)]
*  how are you gonna make my life better? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=579.9000000000001s)]
*  Because my life was better under Trump. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=581.74s)]
*  So Kamala, after four years of doing nothing, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=584.3800000000001s)]
*  just came out with a plan for black men. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=587.62s)]
*  Legalize weed and $20,000 welfare checks. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=591.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=595.26s)]
*  Kamala wants to win the black vote [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=596.26s)]
*  with free money and drugs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  But protecting black jobs is offensive, okay? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=600.1s)]
*  Even black voters are a little suspicious. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  I read that there is a new opportunity agenda, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=608.66s)]
*  a plan for black men, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=611.9s)]
*  which includes a proposal of forgivable loans [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=613.14s)]
*  up to $20,000 for 1 million black entrepreneurs. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=615.58s)]
*  What would you say to the people [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=620.22s)]
*  that would consider the timing of this proposal [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=621.78s)]
*  as political timing? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=625.14s)]
*  I've been in this race about 70 days. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=626.6999999999999s)]
*  You can look at all my work before those 70 days [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=629.42s)]
*  to know that what I'm talking about right now is not new [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  and is not for the sake of winning this election. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=635.26s)]
*  This is about a longstanding commitment, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=637.62s)]
*  including the work that I've done as vice president [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  and before when I was senator and before that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=641.9s)]
*  Kamala has been in power for four years. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=644.58s)]
*  Before that, she was a senator. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  Never proposed this before. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  And three weeks before the election, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=651.1s)]
*  after struggling with the black vote, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=653.26s)]
*  here's a check for 20 grand and a blunt. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=655.7s)]
*  Did Kamala even come up with this pitch? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=658.98s)]
*  Or did her white handlers sit around thinking, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=661.82s)]
*  hmm, black people love handouts and getting high, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=663.86s)]
*  let's give this a shot. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=667.62s)]
*  Democrats have been in charge of the White House [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=669.98s)]
*  for 12 of the last 16 years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  And black Americans feel like they haven't done anything. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=675.22s)]
*  One voter told the New York Times [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=678.78s)]
*  that they elected the first black president [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=680.5400000000001s)]
*  and we're still in the same place. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=683.02s)]
*  Blacks are bailing on Democrats because of their policies, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  but Democrats are trying to reel them in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=689.62s)]
*  with identity politics. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=691.26s)]
*  As it goes to black men, yes, we're out making the case [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=693.5s)]
*  that we have historically low unemployment, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  but we need to do more. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  Our message is solid. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=699.38s)]
*  It's the right one for folks. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=700.78s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, they come back home. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=702.46s)]
*  Walls is guaranteeing it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=706.18s)]
*  They'll come back home. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=708.4599999999999s)]
*  They always come back home. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=709.78s)]
*  Who talks like that about people? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=712.62s)]
*  They don't even try to earn the black vote. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=715.2199999999999s)]
*  They scold, bribe, try to smoke them up. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=717.4599999999999s)]
*  And if you don't come back home quick, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=721.5799999999999s)]

*  Sometimes people need to be chastised, right? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=731.9799999999999s)]
*  I don't think that all the blame should be put on black men, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=735.58s)]

*  There are three excuses. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=750.9000000000001s)]
*  One is misinformation, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=752.1400000000001s)]
*  Two is the media ecosystem, what media you're consuming. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=755.34s)]
*  And three is that perhaps you are a misogynist. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=759.0600000000001s)]
*  Barack gave the media the green light [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=764.9s)]
*  to rough up black voters [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=767.14s)]

*  He has appointed himself the black vote enforcer. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=772.2199999999999s)]
*  You can do this the easy way or the hard way. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  And Lemon prefers the hard way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=778.78s)]
*  MSNBC is bringing out the heavy guns. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=781.66s)]

*  in Trump's favor over the last couple of weeks? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=796.26s)]
*  With these claims that Trump is surging [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=799.1s)]
*  with black and Latino voters [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=801.0600000000001s)]

*  according to secret internal polls, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=805.58s)]
*  despite all the Hitler talk. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=807.98s)]
*  Yes, this race will be far too close [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=810.86s)]
*  because unfortunately we do have a fascist groundswell [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  in parts of this country, mainly among white men, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=817.58s)]
*  let's be clear, but in small pockets [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=820.5s)]
*  among black and brown men too. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=823.06s)]
*  This happens to be a global phenomenon [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=824.9s)]
*  as women become more economically independent [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=828.22s)]
*  and seek positions of power. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=830.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=832.42s)]
*  All right, so fascist, sexist, race trader. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=833.78s)]
*  What else are we missing here? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=837.58s)]
*  This election is gonna be no different. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=839.82s)]
*  They've already started [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=841.98s)]
*  with the misinformation and the lies. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=843.14s)]
*  We know that there is foreign interference [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=846.42s)]
*  and I have to say to everybody listening to this, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=848.22s)]
*  don't let them take your voice [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  because I was part of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  when we investigated Russia's interference [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=860.82s)]
*  in the 2016 election. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=862.82s)]
*  Black folks were targeted with misinformation. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=864.5s)]
*  Ah, black men are sexist, fascist, Russian puppets. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=869.1s)]
*  Got it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=873.58s)]
*  But white dudes for Harris, they're sexy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=874.86s)]
*  Don't you wanna be sexy? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=877.9s)]
*  And when all else fails, you go to Old Faithful, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=880.26s)]
*  scare them back home. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=884.06s)]
*  They can't stop blacks from voting anymore [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=886.38s)]
*  the way they did in the 60s with the same kind of success. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=888.3s)]
*  What they wanna do is they wanna win the election night [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=891.42s)]
*  until the inauguration. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=894.9399999999999s)]
*  And if they can go in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=896.78s)]
*  and they can violently disrupt these counting centers, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=897.98s)]
*  how will states be able to certify elections? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=901.74s)]
*  You burn down a county center in Arizona, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=904.74s)]
*  how does the governor certify those elections? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=906.7s)]
*  What world do we end in? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=909.1s)]
*  Democrats know their party can't function [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=911.5s)]
*  when people or groups think or act independently. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=913.6600000000001s)]
*  The machine is designed to enforce blind loyalty [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=917.34s)]
*  and unquestioning faith. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  Persuasion, not part of the equation. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=922.5s)]
*  Your edict is you're either with us 100% [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=925.5400000000001s)]

*  You swallow every hoax, follow every order, lie for us [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=931.26s)]
*  and nod your head yes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  Anything besides that, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=936.22s)]
*  you have to go see Don and Joy in the dungeon. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=937.82s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal frames Kamala's pitch [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=940.98s)]
*  to black voters as you're either a bad person [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=943.38s)]
*  or you're just stupid. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=947.26s)]

*  One of those notoriously misogynistic black men [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=952.7s)]

*  When you don't like liberal ideas [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=965.3000000000001s)]
*  because you've seen the results, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  Democrats don't try to get better results. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=969.98s)]
*  They just hate you for pointing out they're failing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=973.38s)]
*  See, loyal Democrats are supposed to pretend not to notice. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=976.4200000000001s)]
*  Everyone else gets ridiculed into submission. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=980.7s)]
*  In 2008, Obama called rural America bitter clingers. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  In 16, Hillary called them a basket of deplorables. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=988.82s)]
*  In 2020, Biden called you a threat to democracy. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=993.26s)]
*  And now Democrats are calling their own voters [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=997.02s)]
*  who they think they own sexist Russian plants. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1000.3s)]
*  But here's the catch. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1004.78s)]
*  The media is amplifying the Democrats [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1006.02s)]
*  attacking their own side. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1008.26s)]
*  Democrats expect to be criticized by Republicans, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1010.74s)]
*  but not by other Democrats. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1013.9s)]
*  It stings, especially after the Democrats have done [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1016.02s)]
*  very little for black America in the last decade, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1018.82s)]
*  adding insult to injury. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1021.62s)]
*  When the machine loses control, it can't operate. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1024.06s)]
*  Everything needs to be clicking on all cylinders. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1027.14s)]
*  It's not. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1030.02s)]
*  Biden should have lost the election honorably, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1031.34s)]
*  and the machine would have been able to regroup [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1034.54s)]
*  for the next cycle. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1036.3s)]
*  But Democrats can't accept not being in power. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1037.9s)]
*  And therefore, they had the coup and the Kamala coronation. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1041.06s)]
*  Both acts of desperation have exposed the party's [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1045.46s)]
*  dark underbelly for the whole country to see, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1049.06s)]
*  and is turning off more Democrats [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1052.6599999999999s)]
*  more than any Biden loss would have. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1055.54s)]
*  I'm welcome to Hannity, and tonight Donald Trump [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1057.7s)]
*  has opened up a wide lead in the betting markets, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1059.5s)]
*  bigger than I thought possible, plus Barstool founder, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1063.02s)]
*  Dave Portnoy is out with an epic take down of Kamala Harris, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1066.1399999999999s)]
*  and our own Harris Falkner will join us [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1070.3s)]
*  with an exclusive preview of her town hall [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1072.46s)]
*  with former President Trump that'll air tomorrow [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1076.34s)]
*  right here on the Fox News channel, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1079.26s)]
*  but we begin with something different tonight. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1080.5800000000002s)]
*  I want you to close your eyes for a second. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1081.98s)]
*  Not deep meditation, maybe deep prayer if you want, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1085.3000000000002s)]
*  but try to imagine something actually pretty horrible. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1089.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, this time next year, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1092.66s)]
*  President and Vice President in the White House. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1096.26s)]
*  Because here's a preview of what life would be like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1099.3000000000002s)]
*  in America, especially if they were to pass [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1101.8600000000001s)]
*  their very radical and extreme agenda, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1104.42s)]
*  like the Green New Deal. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1106.9s)]
*  First government spending and inflation will be worse [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1108.78s)]
*  than anything you have ever seen. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1111.5800000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris has made a lot of promises with your money. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1113.38s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1116.42s)]
*  That includes more than a trillion dollars [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1118.02s)]
*  in so-called student loan forgiveness, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1120.14s)]
*  $25,000 to first time home buyers, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1122.02s)]
*  and that is only the beginning. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1124.74s)]
*  And then yesterday, because of the polls [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1126.66s)]
*  where she's lagging in terms of demographically [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1128.7s)]
*  African American men in this country, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  she announced another 20 billion in forgivable loans [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1134.54s)]
*  to African Americans to be handed out on the basis of race. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1137.42s)]
*  And today, while speaking with Charlemagne the God, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  well, Kamala promised to consider [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1145.06s)]
*  a multi-trillion dollar reparations plan. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1148.18s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1151.98s)]
*  I am running to be a president for all Americans. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1153.42s)]
*  That being said, I do have clear eyes [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1156.54s)]
*  about the disparities that exist [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1160.62s)]
*  and the context in which they exist, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1163.54s)]
*  meaning history, to your point. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1166.18s)]
*  So my agenda, well, first of all, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1169.22s)]
*  on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1171.54s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1173.82s)]
*  And I've been very clear about that position. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1175.2s)]
*  Now, she said this in the past. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1178.46s)]
*  Nobody's ever asked her before. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1179.78s)]
*  There is no amount of your money [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1181.3799999999999s)]
*  that Kamala will not spend to win a few votes. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1183.52s)]
*  And of course, the Harris campaign is also promising [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1187.1599999999999s)]
*  to sweeten the deal with a different kind of green, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1189.7s)]
*  if you will. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1192.38s)]
*  As the New York Post put it, quote, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1193.7800000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris urging African American men [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1195.2600000000002s)]
*  to vote for her to legalize weed [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1198.0600000000002s)]
*  despite convicting herself 1,900 people as DA. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1199.94s)]
*  And as we have reported from day one, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1204.98s)]
*  Kamala Harris is the single most radical extreme candidate [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1206.6200000000001s)]
*  to ever run for president as a major party nominee. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1210.0600000000002s)]
*  So expect to see a lot more stories like this one. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1214.5s)]
*  Pay close attention. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1217.3000000000002s)]
*  Transgender yacht killer serving a life sentence [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1218.7s)]

*  thanks to Kamala Harris. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1226.02s)]
*  This is not a made up story. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1227.8600000000001s)]
*  It is not AI generated. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1229.42s)]
*  It is not fake news. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1231.14s)]
*  It is not a cheap fake. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1232.42s)]
*  This murderer killed two grandparents on their boat [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1233.94s)]
*  by tying them to the vessel's anchor, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1236.66s)]
*  throwing them overboard before quote, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1239.18s)]
*  grabbing a beer from the fridge and starting to fish. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1241.02s)]
*  And according to court records, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1243.78s)]
*  this was all part of an elaborate scheme [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1245.3400000000001s)]
*  to steal and launder enough money [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1247.72s)]
*  to pay for a sex change operation. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1249.82s)]
*  And thanks to the policies set by Kamala Harris, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1252.32s)]
*  she said it in her own words on tape [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1255.28s)]
*  and we know she's out there taking this position [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1257.2s)]
*  for many years. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1260.22s)]
*  During her time as California's AG, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1261.44s)]
*  this killer's wish was in fact granted [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1264.06s)]
*  after murdering two people. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1266.78s)]
*  According to a letter obtained [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  by the Washington Free Beacon, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1269.64s)]
*  this convicted killer claimed quote, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1271.46s)]
*  I did receive gender affirming surgery [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1273.4s)]

*  compliments of California taxpayers of course. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1279.48s)]
*  But not only has Kamala Harris supported taxpayer funded [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  sex change operations for inmates, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1286.1200000000001s)]

*  going to sex change operations [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1292.1000000000001s)]
*  for the 12.5 million unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1294.46s)]
*  from over 180 countries. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  Many were terrorized, many with criminal backgrounds, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1301.26s)]
*  many of our top geopolitical foes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1304.94s)]
*  This would be the very definition of madness. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1307.38s)]
*  Nevermind California, Minnesota, you know, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1310.3600000000001s)]
*  being okay with gender affirming care for minors [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1312.94s)]
*  without parental consent. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1316.94s)]
*  Have they ever heard of parental rights? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1319.52s)]
*  And a brand new Trump campaign ad points this out. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1321.5800000000002s)]
*  It is so insane, it's almost hard to believe, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1324.98s)]
*  but it's real. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1329.96s)]
*  Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1331.16s)]
*  And if you had a surgery. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1335.18s)]
*  For prisoners. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1336.5s)]
*  For prisoners, every transgender inmate [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1337.34s)]
*  in the prison system would have access. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1341.3s)]
*  How about we just enforce the immigration laws [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1345.04s)]
*  and secure the border and if you murder two people, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1347.96s)]
*  you don't get a taxpayer funded sex change operation. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1351.18s)]
*  Seems pretty simple, seems pretty logical, right? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1354.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, apparently it was just too difficult [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1357.52s)]
*  for the borders are, allowed these millions and millions [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1359.8999999999999s)]
*  of unvetted illegals into our country, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1363.06s)]
*  including known terrorists, but we don't know where they are [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1365.56s)]
*  and people that would know murderers. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1368.6799999999998s)]
*  And look at all the dozens of Americans murdered, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1370.82s)]
*  dozens of Americans, including children raped, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1373.3s)]
*  hundreds of Americans victims of violent crime. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1376.02s)]
*  We have allowed gang members, drug cartels [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1378.98s)]
*  into the country and as I said, people would terrorize [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1381.22s)]
*  from countries like Iran and Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1385.06s)]
*  Venezuela, China and Russia. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1389.3s)]
*  In Boston, ICE detained an illegal alien [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1391.56s)]
*  who was previously convicted of trafficking fentanyl, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  deported under Donald Trump. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1396.84s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1398.6799999999998s)]
*  He came right back into the country under Harris and Biden, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1399.52s)]
*  was arrested for trafficking, more fentanyl, carjacking [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1402.48s)]
*  and assault with a dangerous weapon. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  And right here in the free state of Florida, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  three Biden Harris unvetted illegals, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1410.04s)]
*  they were just arrested for sexually assaulting a child. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1412.6s)]
*  They also crossed over from the wide open Southern border [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1415.8s)]
*  of your borders are Kamala Harris. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1419.3s)]
*  And if Kamala gets elected, this crisis you can bet [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1422.4s)]
*  will get worse. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1424.3600000000001s)]
*  Border patrol officers, they are now reportedly planning [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1425.2s)]

*  Look at these quotes from some of these people [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1430.58s)]
*  that work on the border in the New York Post. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1433.2s)]
*  "'I'm not doing this bleep again. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1435.64s)]

*  What does that say? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1451.28s)]
*  They want the support of the American people [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1452.1200000000001s)]
*  to do the job they were hired to do. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1454.04s)]
*  After all, what is the point of having a border patrol [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1456.64s)]
*  if there's no borders and they're wide open? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1460.32s)]
*  Now these are serious issues that are frankly [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1462.52s)]
*  national security issues at this point. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1465.32s)]
*  And we have known terrorists in the country [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1467.6s)]
*  and murderers and rapists and other criminals [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1469.64s)]
*  and drug cartels and gang members. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1472.0s)]
*  And the American people have every right to be worried [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1474.2s)]
*  about all of it. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1476.54s)]
*  There should not be a single apartment complex, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1477.88s)]
*  Martha Raddatz, not one taken over by Venezuelan gangs. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1480.2s)]
*  And maybe somebody can help Martha do a little research [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1484.28s)]
*  and maybe ask Kamala Harris what she would say [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1488.16s)]

*  let alone thousands. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1515.88s)]
*  The American people deserve real solutions [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1517.48s)]
*  to the very real crisis that are impacting small towns [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1519.76s)]
*  and big cities across the country. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1523.14s)]
*  Instead, the Harris campaign has been rolling out [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  cheap gimmicks, taxpayer funded, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1527.42s)]
*  no, where I grew up they'd call it bribery, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1529.8s)]
*  but I would never use that word. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1532.06s)]

*  Tim Walz. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1540.0s)]
*  And after spending the weekend pretending to hunt pheasants [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1540.96s)]

*  well today Tim Walz stepped up to the podium [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1547.0s)]
*  in a crisp new flannel shirt, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1549.2s)]
*  accused JD Vance of faking his real life story. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1551.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1556.12s)]
*  Senator Vance, he became a media darling. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1557.48s)]
*  He wrote a book about the place he grew up, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1560.08s)]
*  but the premise was, was trashing that place [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1563.68s)]
*  where he grew up, rather than lifting it up. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1566.4199999999998s)]
*  This guy's a venture capitalist, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1568.74s)]
*  cosplaying like he's a cowboy or something. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1570.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what a venture capitalist does [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1573.02s)]
*  most of the time, because folks who go to work every day, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1575.1799999999998s)]
*  they're the ones that are saying, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1578.9399999999998s)]
*  what are you going to do with the policies [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1580.1799999999998s)]
*  to make my life a little better? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1581.9399999999998s)]
*  You don't know what a venture capitalist does. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1584.6599999999999s)]
*  You have no business being the vice president. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1587.26s)]
*  Now keep in mind, as a young man, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1589.5s)]
*  Tim Walz spent a lot of time, well, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1591.34s)]
*  gallivanting around communist China. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1593.42s)]
*  And meanwhile, after growing a poor with a single mother, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1596.18s)]
*  struggling with addiction, well JD Vance, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1599.02s)]
*  he enlisted in the US Marines. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1601.78s)]
*  He was deployed to Iraq. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1603.7s)]
*  But unlike Tim Walz, he didn't lie about his rank. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1605.98s)]
*  He didn't falsely claim valor that he didn't deserve, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1608.94s)]
*  and claim he fought in a war zone. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1612.18s)]
*  He actually did. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1614.02s)]
*  Vance used his service to help pay for college, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1615.26s)]
*  ultimately law school at Yale. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1617.66s)]
*  He was then successful in business, got into politics, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1619.66s)]
*  and like so many other Americans, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1622.46s)]
*  he is living the American dream, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1625.18s)]
*  starting really at the bottom, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1627.46s)]
*  which apparently makes Tim Walz very angry and jealous. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1629.9s)]
*  And luckily in three weeks, you can reject, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1633.3400000000001s)]
*  and only you can reject, I'm only one vote. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1636.5s)]
*  You can reject in Georgia, North Carolina, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1639.78s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  in the great state of Nevada, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1648.74s)]
*  you can reject the insane policies, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1650.26s)]
*  the utter incompetence that Walz and Harris represent. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1653.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1657.54s)]
*  It's never enough, is it? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1659.58s)]
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1662.22s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi admitted she hasn't spoken to Joe Biden [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1664.18s)]
*  since helping to force him out of the race. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1667.18s)]
*  To be fair, she can't find the Ouija board. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1670.02s)]
*  It appears that Kamala Harris [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1674.9s)]
*  may actually do Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1676.02s)]
*  Her staff has already submitted a list of demands. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1678.66s)]
*  There's Chardonnay, Pina Grigio, Cabernet, Merlot, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  Xanax, Valium. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1688.42s)]
*  Now normally Rogan's podcast can last up to three hours. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1691.5400000000002s)]
*  Three hours, you say? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1696.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, that gives me enough time to bang eight nannies, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1697.94s)]
*  said one man. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1700.7s)]
*  Oh. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1701.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1704.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris is being accused of plagiarism [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1705.34s)]
*  for one of her books. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1707.54s)]
*  Experts say you can tell Kamala didn't write it [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1708.78s)]
*  because it's called Smart on Crime. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1711.1399999999999s)]
*  She allegedly lifted passages from a press release, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1715.9399999999998s)]
*  an AP report, even Wikipedia. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1718.4199999999998s)]
*  Wow, she's sounding more like Joe Biden every day, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1721.02s)]
*  especially chapter four, which is about her uncle [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1724.5s)]
*  who was eaten by cannibals. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1726.78s)]

*  Also ending its run in January, Joe Biden. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1738.1s)]
*  Fun fact, the title Sufs refers to the suffering of men [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1743.1s)]
*  who were dragged along to see this musical. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1747.1s)]
*  A new study says the human nose can detect chemical changes [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1750.1s)]

*  Yeah, just ask anyone in a second. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1757.1s)]
*  Yeah, just ask anyone in an elevator with Jerry Nadler. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1759.1s)]
*  He farts a lot. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1764.1s)]
*  We hope they're farts. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1766.1s)]
*  And two giant pandas are on their way from China [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1769.1s)]
*  to the Smithsonian Zoo as part of a cultural exchange program. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1772.1s)]
*  And because it's an exchange, we've sent them two hippos. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1778.1s)]
*  I'll take it. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1781.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1782.1s)]
*  So last week, this is interesting, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1784.1s)]
*  something called the California Coastal Commission [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1786.1s)]
*  rejected SpaceX's request to launch more rockets [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1789.1s)]
*  from the Vandenberg Space Force Base, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1793.1s)]
*  which is about 150 miles north of LA. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1796.1s)]
*  The commission claims there were no more rockets [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1798.1s)]
*  in the space, and they're now sending them [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1801.1s)]
*  to the space station in the United States. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1803.1s)]
*  And they're sending them to the space station in the United [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1805.1s)]
*  States, which is about 150 miles north of LA. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1808.1s)]
*  The commission claims they're worried about the environmental [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1810.1s)]
*  impact and the sonic booms that ring out for hundreds of miles. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1813.1s)]
*  After all, you wouldn't want to wake up those 180,000 homeless [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1817.1s)]
*  in their tents before noontime, would you? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1821.1s)]
*  But launches like these have been done for the past 70 years, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1824.1s)]
*  not to mention the other sonic booms they allow, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1828.1s)]
*  like letting Eric Swalwell eat bean burritos from Taco Bell. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1831.1s)]
*  But the commission's own words prove they're less worried [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1836.1s)]
*  about SpaceX's environmental impact than Musk's social impact. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1839.1s)]
*  Here's Chairwoman Carol Hart. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1843.1s)]
*  Dealing with a company that does not... [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1846.1s)]
*  that is the head of which has aggressively injected himself [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1850.1s)]
*  into the presidential race. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1855.1s)]
*  See, what she should have said was, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1859.1s)]
*  we're dealing with someone who's injected himself [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1861.1s)]
*  into the presidential race who isn't helping the Democrats. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1863.1s)]
*  But see, that would be honest, the trait that most bureaucrats [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1867.1s)]
*  abhor. After all, Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1870.1s)]
*  the Soros Foundation funds left-wing DAs left and right, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1874.1s)]
*  and Zuckerberg helped swing an election for Joe in 2020. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1878.1s)]
*  See, they're not mad Musk's a political billionaire. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1883.1s)]
*  They're mad he's not their political billionaire. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1886.1s)]
*  Listen to Commissioner Mike... [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1890.1s)]
*  Thank you. I'll take it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1892.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1898.1s)]
*  Listen to Commissioner Mike Wilson. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1900.1s)]
*  This company is owned by the richest person in the world [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1903.1s)]
*  with direct control over what could be the most extensive [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1906.1s)]
*  global communication system on the planet. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1909.1s)]
*  And just last week, that person was speaking [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1912.1s)]
*  about political retribution on a national stage. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1918.1s)]
*  And it was very glib. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1923.1s)]
*  But yet he was standing next to a person, a candidate, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1925.1s)]
*  that openly promotes and is working to normalize that language. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1929.1s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. Oh. Oh, you poor thing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1934.1s)]
*  Look, if you're mad at someone normalizing bizarre language, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1939.1s)]
*  arrest Kamala. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1942.1s)]
*  Every speech sounds like she's barfing up a Word of the Day desk calendar. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1944.1s)]
*  Finally, check out this doozy from Commissioner Gretchen Newsom. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1947.1s)]
*  Right now, Elon Musk is hopping about the country, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1952.1s)]
*  spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking FEMA [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1956.1s)]
*  while claiming his desire to help the hurricane victims [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1960.1s)]
*  with free Starlink access to the Internet. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1963.1s)]
*  Hopping? What, did he lose a leg? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1966.1s)]
*  So this adorable creep is actually mocking Musk [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1969.1s)]
*  for helping disaster victims. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1973.1s)]
*  What the fuck has she done? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1975.1s)]
*  Nothing. She's a bureaucrat. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1977.1s)]
*  While she's shuffling papers, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1979.1s)]
*  Musk delivered better Internet access to North Carolina [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1981.1s)]
*  than public libraries have to horny homeless men, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1984.1s)]
*  like Jamie Lissow. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1988.1s)]
*  Now, do any of these bureaucrats really sound [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1990.1s)]
*  like they care about protecting wildlife? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1994.1s)]
*  They wouldn't know the difference between a brown bear and a Brett bear. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=1996.1s)]
*  Actually, the only difference is one of them [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2000.1s)]
*  no longer shits in the woods. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2002.1s)]
*  Now, the only thing they're really protecting is themselves. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2004.1s)]
*  They're angry at Musk for not throwing his intellect [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2009.1s)]
*  and wealth behind their idiot Kamala, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2012.1s)]
*  and they're abusing their power to punish him. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2014.1s)]
*  Now, Musk is vowing to sue the commission [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2017.1s)]
*  for violating his First Amendment rights, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2019.1s)]
*  claiming his words have nothing to do with his rocket launches, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2021.1s)]
*  like Saturday's Record Breaker. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2025.1s)]
*  That was a first. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2029.1s)]
*  Nobody else in history and the history of the world [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2031.1s)]
*  has ever done that. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2034.1s)]
*  Well, I once caught something shaped like a rocket, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2036.1s)]
*  and, boy, did the ER have a challenge removing that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2039.1s)]
*  But, you know, I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2042.1s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2045.1s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2047.1s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2049.1s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2051.1s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2053.1s)]
*  It wasn't even July 4th. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2055.1s)]
*  Fact is, Musk beat NASA with far less employees and cash, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2058.1s)]
*  and he did it while also trying to cure disease, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2062.1s)]
*  protect press freedom, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2065.1s)]
*  and create an army of obedient robots. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2067.1s)]
*  At least, I hope they're obedient. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2070.1s)]
*  When I say eliminate Doocy, I don't want an argument. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2073.1s)]
*  Musk is changing the world, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2078.1s)]
*  and these bureaucrats think they can get him to shut up. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2080.1s)]
*  They can't, and that drives him crazy, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2083.1s)]
*  because he embraces the call for adventure, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2085.1s)]
*  which is the complete opposite of a bureaucrat. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2088.1s)]
*  A bureaucrat exists purely to seek comfort, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2091.1s)]
*  building a padded world around him [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2095.1s)]
*  without achieving a f***ing thing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2097.1s)]
*  Once a bureaucrat is born, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2099.1s)]
*  its only goal is to feather its nest before it dies. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2101.1s)]
*  But Musk is the enemy of comfort, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2105.1s)]
*  which is weird for a billionaire. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2108.1s)]
*  In fact, it makes being a billionaire [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2110.1s)]
*  the least interesting thing about him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2112.1s)]
*  He realizes that becoming comfortable with life [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2114.1s)]
*  makes you a menace to everyone else, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2117.1s)]
*  because when you have no challenges, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2119.1s)]
*  you use that time to infringe on others, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2121.1s)]
*  like a bureaucrat. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2125.1s)]
*  Do bureaucrats ever learn from failure? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2127.1s)]
*  No. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2129.1s)]
*  They avoid failure by avoiding everything, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2130.1s)]
*  everything worthwhile. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2134.1s)]
*  So when they see someone who chases a child, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2136.1s)]
*  they resent him. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2138.1s)]
*  They've given up on their dreams, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2139.1s)]
*  so they expect you to do the same. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2141.1s)]
*  See, for Musk, it's about failure more than success. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2143.1s)]
*  Failure becomes the next challenge, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2146.1s)]
*  which becomes the next opportunity, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2148.1s)]
*  which leads to wisdom. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2150.1s)]
*  Compare that to those who despise him. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2151.1s)]
*  They say it's over political beliefs, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2153.1s)]
*  but it's far deeper. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2155.1s)]
*  They don't have faith in themselves, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2157.1s)]
*  and they hate those who do. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2159.1s)]
*  Now, they could be inspired by him, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2161.1s)]
*  but it's just easier to envy him [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2163.1s)]
*  and become an obstacle to success. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2165.1s)]
*  They could become an obstacle to the achievement of others. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2167.1s)]
*  But, look, you don't need to agree with his opinions. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2170.1s)]
*  It's a free country. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2172.1s)]
*  You have the right to talk back to him or anybody else. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2173.1s)]
*  But when you try to stifle scientific progress [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2176.1s)]
*  because you hate a candidate, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2179.1s)]
*  you're not the good guys. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2181.1s)]
*  Maybe it should be you that we're launching into space. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2183.1s)]
*  You know, California might look pretty good from up there. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2186.1s)]
*  Let's welcome... [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaltWTCzfdU&t=2189.1s)]
