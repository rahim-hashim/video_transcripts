# Fox News Highlights - June 6th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI)
*  The breakup and the boom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2.24s)]
*  Well, the clash of the Titans was something to behold yesterday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=4.0s)]
*  and the shockwaves are still reverberating through Maggaland and the GOP and the rest of the country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=9.68s)]
*  Will they or won't they kiss and make up? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=14.56s)]
*  Well, hopes for a rapprochement or reconciliation by telephone had a fizzled earlier today [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=17.76s)]
*  when in a phone call with Brett Baer, Trump said Musk just totally lost it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=23.76s)]
*  And Musk's spokesman said that Musk himself didn't give an F about the GOP or the RNC. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=28.24s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=36.72s)]
*  But at the same time, posting on X earlier, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=37.76s)]
*  Musk seemed a little bit maybe to soften agreeing with a Bill Ackman post [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=40.72s)]
*  in which he wrote that he and Trump are better off in an alliance together. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=47.44s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=52.72s)]
*  Look, who knows how all of this drama is going to unfold [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=54.16s)]
*  where it ultimately will end up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=57.68s)]
*  But if anyone thought that liberals were going to welcome Elon Musk with open arms, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=59.92s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries threw cold water on that idea when asked about it earlier today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=66.16s)]
*  Look, no one again knows how this will end up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=72.08s)]
*  as an ongoing unfolding escalation or ultimately they'll get back together. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=76.4s)]
*  We hope they do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=81.52s)]
*  But one thing we do know is that life will go on. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=82.72s)]
*  And there's a lot of great economic news out there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=86.64s)]
*  leading the economic doomsdayers to scratch their heads. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=90.24s)]
*  The people at Bloomberg didn't know what to report. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=95.2s)]
*  And the jobs numbers came in higher than expected at 139,000. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=98.56s)]
*  Only 130 were predicted. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=103.52s)]
*  And wage growth outpaced inflation at 3.9%. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=105.28s)]
*  And digging into the details, it also looks like those jobs that were created [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=110.72s)]
*  were going to native born Americans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=114.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's good news. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=116.48s)]
*  And as a result of all this, the Dow also went up nearly 450 points today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=118.4s)]
*  That is a big wow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  But I thought we were told the sky was falling because of all the Trump tariffs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  As for all that hand wringing, the amount is going to cause inflation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=131.04s)]
*  Well, it did not happen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=134.32s)]
*  The globalists at The Economist are obviously frustrated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=136.72s)]
*  They had to post this headline. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's tariffs have so far caused little inflation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=142.64s)]
*  Boo hoo. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Noting that rarely had economists spoken in such unison. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=147.04s)]
*  Warning about the inflation that was supposedly coming. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=150.88s)]
*  But then they had to add, the administration should not be cheering just yet. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=154.4s)]
*  With tariffs higher than during much of the Depression, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=159.6s)]
*  consumers are bound to see some effect in time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=162.96s)]
*  My friends, that is called wishful thinking from The Economist. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=166.96s)]
*  Well, the truth is Donald Trump has been consistently better on economic issues [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=172.32s)]
*  than all of the so-called experts, than all of his critics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=177.68s)]
*  He ran on restoring the middle class, on bringing jobs back home, enforcing the border, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=181.76s)]
*  lowering energy prices, and getting U.S. better trade deals. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=187.92s)]
*  He's working on all of those issues on all fronts 24-7. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=192.4s)]
*  Despite the court rulings that sometimes have been against him, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=196.88s)]
*  despite limited help from Capitol Hill, despite almost no help from the business community, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=199.76s)]
*  with help from Elon Musk, without help from Elon Musk, he will keep fighting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  And back to Elon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=211.84s)]
*  Look, he's smart enough to know that if he has any political home, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=212.88s)]
*  no party's perfect, but it has to be with the Trump Republicans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=217.76s)]
*  Democrats? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=222.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness, they showed their true selves. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=223.84s)]
*  Every time they sat silently when Tesla's got vandalized, even torched, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=226.96s)]
*  and when their constituents tried to destroy the entire company that Elon Musk worked so hard to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=232.0s)]
*  create. Again, Republicans are not perfect. We criticize Republicans plenty on the angle. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  They have been driving the spending problem for decades. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=243.52s)]
*  But they're not insane, and they don't seek to punish American entrepreneurs and innovators [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=247.36s)]
*  just because they happen to be Democrats. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=253.28s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=256.4s)]
*  The biggest breakup in America is what everyone's talking about. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=257.52s)]
*  Well, everyone except Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=260.88s)]
*  Here's exactly what he said. Quote, I'm not even thinking about Elon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=263.2s)]
*  He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  He said he won't be speaking to him for a while, but he said he wishes Elon Musk well. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=271.2s)]
*  I mean, the blast radius from this fallout is really, really big and very wide. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=278.32s)]
*  But right now, he said he's not interested in that, and he's moving on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=285.36s)]
*  A moving on. No one ever wants to hear that. Trump just says he's too busy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=289.76s)]
*  What's your view on Elon Musk as of today? I mean, have you heard from him at all? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=296.8s)]
*  Honestly, I've been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  working on something. I'm not thinking about him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=305.76s)]
*  I just wish him well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=309.2s)]
*  47 is planning on getting rid of anything that reminds him of Musk. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=311.04s)]
*  Remember that shiny red Tesla that Elon sold him? Well, it's getting doged. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  There is a Tesla there that President Trump bought during a Tesla demo on the South Lawn [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  a few months ago to try to help Elon Musk's business while it was being vandalized. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  We are told that that Tesla still sitting there, the red Tesla with Florida tags, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=330.16s)]
*  is either going to be given away or sold off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=334.72s)]
*  But Trump says Elon can keep some of the things he gave him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=338.8s)]
*  You gave Elon Musk when he left the White House, it's a volatile plea to the White House, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=343.92s)]
*  to the administration in large. I think that's what. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Would you like to give that back? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  No, I don't take things back. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Elon woke up this morning and signaled he'd be open to burying the hatchet. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=355.36s)]
*  Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman says they're stronger together than apart. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  Elon responded saying you're not wrong. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=365.44s)]
*  Elon tried to set up a phone call with Don and maybe work things out. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=368.8s)]
*  Trump said, no, he's not interested. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=373.92s)]
*  Elon's totally lost it, is what Trump's telling people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=376.4s)]
*  He'd rather take anyone else's call. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=379.92s)]
*  He even picked up the phone when ABC called at the crack of dawn. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=381.92s)]
*  You call the president on his cell phone at 6 45. He picks up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=386.64s)]
*  Yeah, he picked up. Look, there's been reporting out there that the White House is working to put [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=389.28s)]
*  together a call between Elon Musk and Donald Trump to broker some kind of peace. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=392.88s)]
*  I asked Donald Trump about that. He said he's not particularly interested in talking to Elon Musk. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=397.6s)]
*  He said Elon wants to talk to him. He's not ready to talk to to Musk, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=402.0s)]
*  who he called a man who has lost his mind. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=406.24s)]
*  Everyone at the White House chose sides and not a lot of people sided with Musk. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=409.92s)]
*  Insiders say we're dealing with someone who's unstable. We saw it coming. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=414.56s)]
*  We have one president, one person got elected. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=419.12s)]
*  Some people in the White House say they didn't really like Elon's attitude. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=422.56s)]
*  People in Trump world feel like the president gave him everything and he still stabbed him in the back. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=427.44s)]
*  Quote, the president treated him almost like a son. He invited his family to Christmas dinner. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=433.68s)]
*  He let him sleep over. He let him walk in and out of meetings. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=439.12s)]
*  The president went to the max informality to welcome this guy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=442.72s)]
*  Trump brought him the UFC fights and rallies. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=447.12s)]
*  Here they are behind the scenes at MSG. Watch. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=450.4s)]
*  You want to go on stage, Ed? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  You do? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=455.12s)]
*  Why, you're crazy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=456.32s)]
*  Is this thing on? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  Should we save President Trump? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  It's game over. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=471.12s)]
*  Hi. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  More? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  Still have a good time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=484.32s)]
*  You go have a good time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=489.28s)]
*  That's from the art of the surge. You can watch more of that on Fox Nation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  But after the campaign and 130 days in the White House, sources say Elon overstayed his welcome. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=495.52s)]
*  Talked to a couple of people yesterday who said Elon had privately talked about, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=502.32s)]
*  well, maybe I could extend my time in the White House. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=505.28s)]
*  Trump politely said, you've done a great job. You can leave now. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=507.6s)]
*  They weren't quite as close as they were at the very frenzied beginning of that situationship. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=513.2s)]
*  But it was a good lukewarm relationship. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=518.8s)]
*  We can't confirm that. But working at the White House, there's a lot of pressure [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=521.68s)]
*  and everything's a turf war. Doge was in everyone's department. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=526.0s)]
*  Remember that black guy that Elon was sporting last week? He said it was from X, his son. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=530.96s)]
*  PBD says there might be more to that story. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=536.72s)]
*  If you use your imagination, God knows what happened with that black guy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=540.96s)]
*  That black guy, you know, was it a fight that took place? Somebody swung and really offended. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=546.64s)]
*  Elon is like, look what I'm going to do to you guys. Is that a Lutnik? Is that I don't know who [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=551.84s)]
*  else said it? Who else will be in that room? I don't know who it is. Maybe. But think about that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=555.84s)]
*  That doesn't accidentally happen. And you want to do something like this too. Maybe it was a meeting [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  while they're calling each other out and somebody just, cause Elon started calling out Trump and it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=563.92s)]
*  got nasty. And then somebody swung. That's obviously speculation, but there's a lot of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=569.04s)]
*  rumors flying around and no one's trying to cancel Elon. He had a beef with the big, beautiful bill [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=574.88s)]
*  and has a right to speak his mind. He's saying he doesn't want tax relief and he wanted to keep his [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=582.16s)]
*  subsidies going. And he thinks we're spending too much, but he had to know, he had to know, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=588.24s)]
*  going scorched earth in public the way he did about the centerpiece of the Trump agenda was going to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=594.64s)]
*  cause a massive earthquake. Republican sources tell us Musk won't be able to kill the bill, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=601.68s)]
*  but he's killing the whole sales pitch. So they want to move on and pass this beauty by Independence [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=608.88s)]
*  day. AOC though, digging the drama. Oh man, the girls are fighting, aren't they? You know, I [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=615.12s)]
*  would say that this was something that was a long time coming where we've been seeing that these two [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=625.52s)]
*  huge egos were not long for being together in this world as friends. And so I think we're, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=632.72s)]
*  I think this breakup we've been seeing a long time coming, but we'll see what the impacts are [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=642.8s)]
*  at, are of it legislatively. AOC doesn't get it. Republicans are allowed to speak their mind. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=647.52s)]
*  Democrats, they get handed talking points and they can't have an opinion. So they're all budding [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=652.88s)]
*  heads about what to do. Swalwell says if Democrats win back the house, they're going to open up the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  Epstein files and look for Trump's name, but he better be careful where he looks because he might [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=664.16s)]
*  find Clinton's. Some Democrats are trying to woo Elon back into their party. Sorry we burnt your [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=669.5200000000001s)]
*  car as Nazi and accused you of killing 300,000 people. No, that's not happening. Elon's not that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  naive. And even Democrats don't flip flop that fast. Others want Trump to finally be a dictator [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=682.96s)]
*  on day one and get revenge. Those Doge employees, the people that Axelrod was just talking about, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=690.6400000000001s)]
*  are very dangerous. If Donald Trump is smart, the first thing he's going to do is fire, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=698.08s)]
*  investigate and prosecute all of Elon's people who are all throughout government with their laptops, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=702.96s)]
*  downloading data right now. Trump's going to lock up big balls? Fat chance. Trump just had a falling [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=708.08s)]
*  out with his biggest donor, the world's richest man, and Democrats don't even know what to say. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=714.96s)]
*  CNN thinks Trump's going to have Elon executed. I think this is bad for Musk. I am, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=721.76s)]
*  if you look at the history around the world of authoritarians breaking up with their oligarch [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=733.52s)]
*  buddies, those oligarch buddies don't end up in a good place. They either end up impoverished, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=737.92s)]
*  imprisoned or dead. I'm not saying that that's going to happen to Elon Musk here, but the power [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=743.12s)]
*  is with the government. You saw Donald Trump immediately say, all right, we're going to take [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=748.8s)]
*  away your contracts. We're going to punish you and retaliate. And he has the power to do that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=754.56s)]
*  We've seen Donald Trump exercise that power. Democrats are like, Trump is going to kill you. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=761.92s)]
*  You're safe with us. We'll protect you, Elon, for a price. If Trump was a murderous dictator, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  everybody in the press would be dead and Comey would be six feet deep. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=773.84s)]
*  Trump's had people come and go his whole life. DeSantis is still alive. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=778.96s)]
*  Omarosa is still kicking and Michael Cohen, he hasn't had any accidents. It's not like Trump's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=783.76s)]
*  Hillary and just off people, allegedly. Politics is vicious. Having Elon around was fun, but just [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  because he's gone doesn't mean the fun's over. Trump says America's hot. Six months ago, it was [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=799.28s)]
*  cold as ice. He's keeping his mind busy and says after the big, beautiful bill, he's building a big, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=805.52s)]
*  beautiful ballroom. Quote, just inspected the site of the new ballroom that'll be built. Compliments [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=812.48s)]
*  of a man known as Donald J. Trump at the White House for 150 years. Presidents and many others [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=818.48s)]
*  have wanted a beautiful ballroom, but it never got built because nobody previously had any [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=824.56s)]
*  knowledge or experience in doing such things, but I do. And these are the fun projects I do while [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=829.5999999999999s)]
*  thinking about the world economy, the United States, China, Russia, and lots of other countries, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=836.88s)]
*  places and events. It will all be good, maybe even great, depending on who is the president of the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=841.68s)]
*  USA. Trump's going to throw a party, a party of the century at the White House, and we'll see if [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=847.52s)]
*  Elon makes the cut. And welcome to this special edition of Hannity. All right, so the magnitude [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=854.24s)]
*  of the mess that Joe Biden left behind and how President Trump is now having a clean house, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  well, I want to be really crystal clear about one thing. The sheer volume and extent of the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=866.96s)]
*  unmitigated disasters that President Trump inherited, it's almost unthinkable. The economy [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=873.68s)]
*  in a complete state of shambles, massive inflation, prices up 20%, gas prices through the roof, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=880.16s)]
*  growth was next to nothing. Few private sector jobs were being created. Wages stagnant, consumer [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=887.68s)]
*  debt through the roof, American industry gutted, interest rates tripled, and the border, we endured [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=894.64s)]
*  record level of illegal immigration anywhere from 12 to 20, nobody knows the exact number, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=901.12s)]
*  in just four years, including, let's see, known terrorists. We have, oh, Iranian assassination [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=907.6s)]
*  squads. We have gang members, cartel members, human traffickers, drug traffickers. We have [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=913.44s)]
*  murderers, we have rapists, we have other violent criminals in this country, all operating inside [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=919.52s)]
*  our country with virtually no fear of deportation under Joe Biden. Overseas, Biden failed to prevent [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=925.76s)]
*  costly new wars on not one, but two continents. No one respected, nobody feared the U.S. after [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=932.56s)]
*  the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Our relationship with our allies in the Middle East [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=940.16s)]
*  was in shambles. Everybody worldwide knew it was a cognitive mess. China operating with impunity, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=945.84s)]
*  including, you know, over our own airspace. Remember the spy balloon? And back at home, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=953.36s)]
*  we had virulent anti-Semitism, extremism from Biden's own base of his party. That was on the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=959.04s)]
*  rise from college campuses to the halls of Congress. President Trump came within a millimeter of losing [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=965.2s)]
*  his life to an assassin, and another would be assassin later. And meanwhile, college campuses, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=972.16s)]
*  they became nothing but hotbeds of bigotry, woke politics, infiltrating every part of American [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=978.08s)]
*  life, including our military and our schools. And let's not forget about the out-of-control bureaucracy [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=984.24s)]
*  that waged a campaign of lawfare, censorship against Trump, his supporters, while also wasting [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=990.64s)]
*  billions and billions of your dollars on broadband internet that failed to connect anyone and to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=998.08s)]
*  anything and charging stations that were never built. And we spent billions on that and a slew [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1005.12s)]
*  of other bizarre left-wing projects, both at home and all over the world. Oh, and if they had their [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  way, they would pick the car in your driveway. They would take away your gas stove. They would [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1015.76s)]
*  take away your plastic straws. They would take away your air conditioner. They would take away [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1020.48s)]
*  your refrigerator. So much for the pro-choice party. And as you can see, Trump is also facing [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1024.1599999999999s)]
*  the challenge of a lifetime. But tonight, despite all of the noise, all of the hysteria, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1029.92s)]
*  all the doom, the gloom predictions from the left, well, we are seeing mass of progress. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1035.44s)]
*  President Trump is fixing the country. Look at one item. Look at the economy. Trump slashing [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  regulations, unchained American oil and gas industry so America can aspire to energy dominance. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1046.8000000000002s)]
*  That'll make us rich. A lot of high paying career jobs for people. And of course, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1054.88s)]
*  President Trump halting Biden's expansion of government and the bureaucracy. And now look at [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1059.2800000000002s)]
*  the results. Take a look. It's really exciting overall. And look, the real story here is the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  government jobs are down and the small business economy is growing and the private economy is [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1072.96s)]
*  growing. This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted to do for inversing everything that Biden had done. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1078.4s)]
*  If we look at the earnings from a month over month perspective, it comes in up four tens, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1083.6s)]
*  up four tens, much better than expected. We're looking for up three tens. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1090.24s)]
*  This is the third jobs they beat in a row, right? The third time the president beat [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1094.0s)]
*  expectations in a row. He's created over 500,000 jobs since he was inaugurated. And that's while [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1097.76s)]
*  cutting the federal workforce by 50,000 jobs, thanks to efforts to trim waste, waste, fraud and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1102.48s)]
*  abuse. And amazingly, the very respected Atlanta Fed this week says they're projecting four [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  point six percent growth for the second quarter. Now for the third month in a row, the jobs report [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1113.6s)]
*  outpacing expectations. One hundred and forty thousand new jobs in the month of May. Now, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1119.36s)]
*  keep in mind, those are private sector jobs filled by American workers. That is the direct opposite [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  of what we saw under Biden. That's not all. Hourly earnings for Americans up a significant four [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1131.28s)]
*  percent. That helps against inflation that Biden created. And amid Donald Trump's tariff negotiations, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1137.6s)]
*  inflation went down. Oh, went down to two point one percent right where the Fed likes it. Maybe [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1143.68s)]
*  Jerome Powell will get off his duff and maybe he'll drop a full basis point and get the economy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1150.08s)]
*  moving, which every other country has done. And get this, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed by a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1156.6399999999999s)]

*  which he used for sexual gratification. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1606.24s)]
*  It's crazy. Why not just steal one and use it 75 times? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1609.52s)]
*  Learned that from Kudlow. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1616.0s)]
*  Dogs can be an official witness at weddings in Colorado. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1619.28s)]
*  The law would have to be passed to the judge, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1622.8s)]
*  and the judge would have to be able to take the dog to court. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1625.04s)]
*  The law would also apply to cats, except the women who own them never marry. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1628.88s)]

*  Well, you can say that again, said one man. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1699.28s)]
*  And finally, Zimbabwe is considering killing dozens of elephants [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1705.44s)]
*  and distributing the meat to its people. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1708.96s)]
*  Coincidentally, the State Department is warning Joy Behar to avoid Zimbabwe. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1711.68s)]
*  Those were good. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  That was a good bunch. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1724.48s)]
*  So what a feud between Trump and Musk. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1726.4s)]
*  It started when Elon called Trump's big, beautiful bill a disgusting abomination. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1729.44s)]
*  Which, by the way, was the original title for a Jesse show. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1734.64s)]
*  But after that, things went downhill faster than Taylor Swift once she hit 30. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1741.2s)]
*  I know, really let herself go. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1747.68s)]
*  And I have to say, they're making all of us billionaires look bad. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1751.92s)]
*  Seriously, the last time people aired out that much dirty laundry [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1756.32s)]
*  was Jerry Nadler's staff after Taco Tuesday. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1759.44s)]
*  But the Dems and the media are in a state of shock. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1765.04s)]
*  Wait, you guys disagree? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1768.0s)]
*  Over principles? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1770.16s)]
*  Out in the open? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1771.52s)]
*  In front of the American people? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1772.72s)]
*  Gross, why don't you do what we did? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1774.56s)]
*  Agree to a massive backroom cover-up to conceal our horror show of a presidency? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1777.12s)]
*  Sure, that put our nation at risk, but no one's gonna laugh at us. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1782.48s)]
*  And then later you can write a tell-all book that implicates yourself when he's out of office. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1786.08s)]
*  So yeah, I'll take this public tussle over the cover-up of a missing president. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1791.44s)]
*  But the Trump White House, we know what's going on behind the scenes. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1796.8000000000002s)]
*  Because there is no behind the scenes. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1799.92s)]
*  Like Brit Hume and Espino. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1802.8000000000002s)]
*  They're showing way more than we need to see. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1804.96s)]
*  Trump wants the tax cuts he promised while Elon is really pissed at his own wife. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1809.92s)]
*  And he's gonna have to pay for it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1814.96s)]
*  Trump wants the tax cuts he promised while Elon is really pissed about the bill's lasting impact. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1816.88s)]
*  But the Dems, it's not about which side is right. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1822.8000000000002s)]
*  To them, what's right never factors in. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1825.5200000000002s)]
*  It's just politics to them. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1828.4s)]
*  So while this tith is passionate, it's also authentic and brave. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1830.0800000000002s)]
*  Two things the Dems aren't. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1835.5200000000002s)]
*  Musk is risking it all because he believes in something. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1837.44s)]
*  Trump has proven he'll risk his life for all of us. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1840.5600000000002s)]
*  This is a patriot speaking truth to another patriot. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1843.84s)]
*  Not lying or hoaxing or deceiving Americans simply to hold onto power. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1847.6799999999998s)]
*  But the media shrieks because this behavior is so alien to them. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1852.9599999999998s)]
*  As cowards, they don't get the concept of fighting for principles. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1856.9599999999998s)]
*  But look, no one wants to see these guys at war. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1861.36s)]
*  If Kilmeade and I can work together, so can they. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1864.32s)]
*  Don't let a self-inflicted wound ruin progress for millions of Americans. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1869.44s)]
*  Remember, the mission is always bigger than the relationship. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1873.76s)]
*  And part of that mission is Doze. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1876.96s)]
*  And through Doze, the president and Elon showed how our taxes are being laundered [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1878.88s)]
*  to support illegal left-wing causes. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  And revealing bureaucracies like USAID to be as corrupt as my computer files [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1886.16s)]
*  after I clicked that email link about Korean teens. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1890.96s)]
*  In other words, all of us should remember that the goal is the product [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1894.88s)]
*  and it's one that can live forever. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1898.72s)]
*  It's like when David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen had their falling out. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1900.96s)]
*  Sure, he had to deal with Sammy Hagar for a while. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1904.72s)]
*  But the magic that Dave and Eddie created, it lives on forever. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  Even today, if you hear Hot for Teacher in a bar, you'd bang Mrs. Doubtfire. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1911.44s)]
*  So Trump and Musk, we need them as a team for the sake of our country's future. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1916.32s)]
*  And they both need to admit the amazing work they've already done [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1921.52s)]
*  and that there's much more work left to do. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1924.4s)]
*  And every second they spend infighting is a chance for AOC [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  to look slightly less retarded. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1930.96s)]
*  So I hope this gets settled. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1935.44s)]
*  But if it doesn't, then we'll have to wait and see. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1937.04s)]
*  And I hope that's the end of this episode of The Daily Show. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1940.08s)]
*  So I hope this gets settled. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1943.84s)]
*  But if it doesn't, we will lovingly accept that such disagreements [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1945.44s)]
*  are aired out in the open. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1949.52s)]
*  We voted for it. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1951.2s)]
*  And unlike the Dems, we'll take a feud over a fraud any day. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1952.56s)]
*  All right, Charlie, how big is this story? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1965.84s)]
*  Is it a big story or is it a summer fun story? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1970.96s)]
*  Where do you see it going? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1974.4s)]
*  I think it's all of the above. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the most important thing is what you said, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1977.04s)]
*  which is it's all happening out in the open. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1978.96s)]
*  You've got this. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1981.2s)]
*  It's sort of like the two gladiators going at it at the Roman Coliseum, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1981.92s)]
*  the two greatest people on Twitter going at it in just like monstrous fashion. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1986.96s)]
*  And I love that it's out in the open and I love that it's really freaking entertaining. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1993.04s)]
*  And by the way, how did anybody think this was going to end any other way? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  Of course you were going to get this. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  And it is honest. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2002.9599999999998s)]
*  People are asking, is this thing staged? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2003.84s)]
*  It's not staged. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2006.2399999999998s)]
*  That said, I think that they could sort of patch up very quickly. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2007.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think that the fissure between the two is that you have [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2011.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, who is in his second term, and he's operating as a second, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, trying to make the system work. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk is still the barbarian at the gate that Donald Trump was. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2021.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is now past the gate trying to make it work. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2025.04s)]
*  And Elon is still the barbarian at the gate saying, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2027.92s)]
*  you can't do this because it's so bad. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2030.48s)]
*  And it's like, dude, have you ever seen a bill get put together? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  It's so disgusting. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2035.92s)]
*  Of course it's disgusting, but there are good things in it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2037.68s)]
*  And Trump wants to get that done. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2040.48s)]
*  Of course, at the end, I do want to see him get back together. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2042.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Musk thinks, if you can build a rocket, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2044.72s)]
*  you've got to be able to do this bill. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2048.4s)]
*  But a bill is harder than a rocket, sadly. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2049.84s)]
*  Yeah, so Trump is an executive, and that's why he's very good. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2053.04s)]
*  He's not a legislative guy. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2056.72s)]
*  And Elon Musk is something like executive squared. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2058.64s)]
*  He's like, he truly does, you know, he just off the top of his head [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2061.2799999999997s)]
*  gets things done. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2065.84s)]
*  And it's got to be so frustrating. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2066.88s)]
*  But, you know, that is kind of how the legislative process works. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2068.16s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2072.0s)]
*  You know, Tom, Charlie makes an interesting point. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2072.88s)]
*  That saying is a bull in a china shop, not two bulls in a china shop. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think there's a lot of people saying today, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2081.04s)]
*  oh, I hope they patch this up. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2083.6s)]
*  I don't even know if they need to patch it up. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2085.04s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk is not in government. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2087.44s)]
*  He needed him for a while. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2090.16s)]
*  And he seemed to be having a lot of fun on the campaign trail. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2091.84s)]
*  And even Elon said, he said, you know, look, Trump's not perfect, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2094.88s)]
*  but we need him right now. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2098.48s)]
*  Like he said, this is desperate. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2100.08s)]
*  And so him and all his tech bros were like, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2103.04s)]
*  like Trump's not our favorite guy in the whole world, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  but we absolutely need him. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2108.32s)]
*  So he's out of government now. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2110.8s)]
*  He's not in Doge. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2112.8s)]
*  So why can't Trump just feud with him for the rest of his life? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2113.92s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2116.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  And Trump, you know, like he seems to get along with people [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  that he disagrees with. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2122.4s)]
*  He gets along, as he says, with Putin. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2123.6800000000003s)]
*  Or he talks about Xi. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  He went to North Korea. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2126.88s)]
*  So Trump can get along with people. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2127.92s)]
*  He could still cut deals with him. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2129.6800000000003s)]
*  He doesn't have to be buddies with him. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2131.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2132.6400000000003s)]
*  But I mean, does this make Trump look so reasonable? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2133.04s)]
*  I thought Trump was an impulsive tweeter. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2136.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2138.32s)]
*  Trump was like. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2140.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2143.12s)]
*  He's the cooler head that prevails. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2144.8s)]
*  It's a new role for Trump. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2147.76s)]
*  Trump was like, oh, yeah, Elon is wrong. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2149.2s)]
*  And Elon was like, I'm leaving the planet. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2151.04s)]
*  Epstein Island. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2153.04s)]
*  Todd, let's pretend people listen to you. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2159.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2161.68s)]
*  Suspend disbelief for a second. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2163.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2164.64s)]
*  What advice would you give to the, could you give any advice? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2166.56s)]
*  Can I give advice as a human? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2170.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2171.92s)]
*  My 47 years on this planet have allowed me to give advice. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2172.4s)]
*  My advice would be, I think they both [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2175.28s)]
*  need to go to their corners, figure out why they're upset, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2177.4s)]
*  take a deep breath, and then ultimately get back. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  Because if you look at Trump's history, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2182.6000000000004s)]
*  Trump feuded very publicly with the entire 2016 Republican [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2185.28s)]
*  primary field. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2191.04s)]
*  Like said really mean things about them, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2192.2400000000002s)]
*  like Ted Cruz, serial killer, things like that. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2195.2000000000003s)]
*  And now they're all under the Trump tent. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2199.28s)]
*  Lindsey Graham. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2201.76s)]
*  I mean, you remember like, hey, I'm [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2202.48s)]
*  going golfing with Lindsey Graham. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2203.6000000000004s)]
*  Lindsey Graham's the worst human ever. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2204.88s)]
*  And then they're going golfing again the next week. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2206.8s)]
*  I agree with Charlie that it's bigger than this time. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2208.8s)]
*  And the egos here are two of the biggest egos [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2211.36s)]
*  that you've ever seen. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2213.28s)]
*  But I think it'll get back. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2214.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't think this is an ego thing. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2215.0s)]
*  I think that Musk really believes [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2216.88s)]
*  that the world is going to collapse if he doesn't get back. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2219.0800000000004s)]
*  But I think both can be true. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2222.52s)]
*  I think absolutely both can be true. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2223.0400000000004s)]
*  I guess my favorite part of this entire story is this. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2224.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's say Kennedy and I want to engage in a social media [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2228.36s)]
*  feud. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2231.04s)]
*  I don't know, perhaps over the fact [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  that on the last Gutfeld, she called me not a real Fox [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2233.32s)]
*  and Friends anchor. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2236.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2237.1200000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2237.6s)]
*  Call back. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2240.52s)]
*  We go on a social media platform, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2242.48s)]
*  and we attack each other. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2244.8s)]
*  These two bought their own social media platforms [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2246.1200000000003s)]
*  to attack each other. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2249.28s)]
*  Like Trump's on true social. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2250.4s)]
*  It's mine. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2252.1200000000003s)]
*  And like Elon Musk owns X. And that just shows, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2252.84s)]
*  I think, the stakes here and how this is so much bigger [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2255.1200000000003s)]
*  than I think we can even understand. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2257.88s)]
*  But that's what also makes it, to a certain extent, funny. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2260.0s)]
*  And I think, to a certain extent, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2263.2400000000002s)]
*  sort of interesting to shine a light on how our world works [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2264.84s)]
*  right now, which is just kind of ridiculous. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2268.32s)]
*  But we're all along for the ride. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2270.6s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2272.12s)]
*  So Kennedy, the ride's about to end. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2273.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a great ride. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2276.28s)]
*  People don't want to get off. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2278.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2279.92s)]
*  You know, if they do want to get off, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2280.6s)]
*  they'll come to New York for the Pride Parade, I guess. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2281.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2284.12s)]
*  I just, I am so deeply amused by how quickly this escalated. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2286.8s)]
*  And it's like, we're not going to use your rockets. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2291.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm decommissioning my rockets. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2294.5600000000004s)]
*  It reminded me of Step Brothers. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm just waiting for Elon to rub his balls all over Trump's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2299.04s)]
*  drum kit. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2302.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2303.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2303.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2304.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2304.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2305.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2305.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2306.4s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2311.52s)]
*  Like, it's weird to see two billionaires act [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2312.6000000000004s)]
*  like each one trying to up the other auntie. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2318.12s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2318.62s)]
*  You went to Epstein. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2319.12s)]
*  It's like, how do you walk back from that? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2320.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2322.12s)]
*  I'm sure they could just pick up the phone. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2322.62s)]
*  It's like, no, Elon Musk wrote himself an insurance policy [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2324.24s)]
*  to make sure that this is an unhealable rift. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2327.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2331.52s)]
*  For whatever reason. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2332.02s)]
*  And I think you're absolutely right. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, he feels like he's like, I left my company's. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2334.2799999999997s)]
*  Tesla's in the gutter. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2337.68s)]
*  I came and did this because it's so incredibly necessary. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2339.04s)]
*  And finally, I have a politician who's listening to me. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2341.4s)]
*  And then he just turns his back on me. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2343.8s)]
*  And he shivs me with a bill that's just going to add [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2345.8s)]
*  to the debt. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is horrible. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2350.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2351.44s)]
*  So it's a slap in the face. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2352.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2354.88s)]
*  Before we go, come see me on tour. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2355.52s)]
*  This week, and I'll be with some nobody named Tom Shalhou. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2359.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2362.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2362.9s)]
*  Gross. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2363.4s)]
*  Gross. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2363.9s)]
*  Gross. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2364.4s)]
*  Gross. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2364.9s)]
*  Gross. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2365.4s)]
*  And the great Joe Mackey in Grand Rapids. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2366.48s)]
*  You get three for the price of one. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2369.48s)]
*  That's Grand Rapids, Michigan. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2370.88s)]
*  And then the next day, Rockford, Illinois. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2372.24s)]
*  In September, I'll be in Pennsylvania, Connecticut. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2376.6s)]
*  And then in later the year, Arizona and Texas. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2379.4399999999996s)]
*  Go to ggutfeld.com for tickets. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P900XAwgkfI&t=2382.2799999999997s)]
