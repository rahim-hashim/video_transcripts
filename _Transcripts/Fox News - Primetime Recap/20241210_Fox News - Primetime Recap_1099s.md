# Fox News Highlights - Dec. 9 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk)
*  Some very good news tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=0.0s)]
*  I can report that all hope is not lost in New York. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=2.2s)]
*  Daniel Penny, acquitted today in a criminal case [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=7.32s)]
*  that never should have been brought by a DA's office [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=9.9s)]
*  that has repeatedly failed to put the safety [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=13.08s)]
*  of New Yorkers ahead of politics. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=16.16s)]
*  Now, after Penny used a choke hold [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=18.28s)]
*  to restrain menacing lunatic Jordan Neely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=19.88s)]
*  on a subway car in May, 2023, which led to his death, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=22.88s)]
*  Alvin Bragg's office charged him [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=26.52s)]
*  with second degree manslaughter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=29.0s)]
*  Now the defendant with no criminal record, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=31.68s)]
*  a proud Marine vet who stood up when no one else would [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=33.96s)]
*  gets charged, yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  But on Friday, the jury announced it was deadlocked. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=39.24s)]
*  So at the behest of Bragg's office, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=41.4s)]
*  Judge Maxwell T. Wiley directed them to come back [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=43.68s)]
*  after the weekend to consider the lesser charge [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=48.16s)]
*  of criminally negligent homicide outrageous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  But the jury rejected that as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=53.84s)]
*  If anyone is guilty of criminal negligence here, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=56.78s)]
*  it's the folks like Alvin Bragg [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=60.92s)]
*  and his assistant DA, Daphna Yoran, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=62.64s)]
*  whose virtue signaling and soft on crime approach [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=65.12s)]
*  have caused enormous pain and suffering [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=68.12s)]
*  to the everyday New Yorkers whose lives matter too. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=70.36s)]
*  Bragg of course has been humiliated [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=74.48s)]
*  after wasting millions of taxpayer dollars [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=76.18s)]
*  in his crazed criminal prosecution against Donald Trump [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=78.64s)]
*  before of course the election night victory. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=81.84s)]
*  He released a statement today saying he respects [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=83.92s)]
*  the jury's decision but noted, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  unfortunately over the duration of this trial, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=88.72s)]
*  talented career prosecutors and their family members [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=91.18s)]
*  were besieged with hate and threats [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  on social media, by phone, over email. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=95.68s)]
*  Simply put, this is unacceptable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I agree with him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=100.88s)]
*  It is completely unacceptable. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=102.04s)]
*  No one should be threatened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=104.64s)]
*  And yet that's exactly what Jordan Neely did [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  to those subway passengers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=109.48s)]
*  By the way, do you know this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=111.44s)]
*  All but two of the 11 witnesses who testified at trial [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=112.84s)]
*  said Mr. Neely's presence amounted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=117.16s)]
*  to the scariest experience that ever had on a subway. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=119.24s)]
*  Now in many ways, this case's outcome does harken back [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=124.44s)]
*  to Bernie Getz's acquittal in 1985 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=127.64s)]
*  because that came during another time [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=130.72s)]
*  when people in New York were feeling increasingly fed up [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=132.84s)]
*  with liberal do-gooders helping violent criminals get off. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=136.36s)]
*  Most regular people then and now just wanna return [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=140.14s)]
*  to safety and normalcy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=143.42s)]
*  But of course the usual racial arsonist [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  reacted to the verdict today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=149.1s)]
*  Someone who never rides the subway, by the way, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=150.77999999999997s)]
*  the Reverend Al Sharpton, he put out a statement saying, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  this verdict represents the blatant legalization [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=156.94s)]
*  of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=160.06s)]
*  that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=164.1s)]
*  even if it leads to someone's death. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=166.61999999999998s)]
*  But what Al doesn't get is that the people of New York [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=169.44s)]
*  have just had it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=175.6s)]
*  Maybe the rev should just brush off, I guess, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=177.28s)]
*  the crowds that Trump drew in New York and the Bronx, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  just ignoring that Madison Square Garden. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=183.84s)]
*  But he's brushing that off, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=186.64s)]
*  but he should have paid more attention. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=187.94s)]
*  Those people know that the danger to America [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=190.12s)]
*  isn't from Trump, it's not from people like Daniel Penny [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=193.68s)]
*  or overzealous cops. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=196.88s)]
*  The danger to New Yorkers and the rest of the people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=198.84s)]
*  in this country come from prosecutors [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  who wanna punish law-abiding Americans [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=203.92s)]
*  by making excuses for hardened criminals [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=206.68s)]
*  and also marauding migrants. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=209.12s)]
*  And more of us see that the Black Lives Matter crowd, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  well, they are kind of what we said they were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=214.48s)]
*  back in 2020, frauds. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=216.56s)]
*  We need some black vigilantes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=219.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=222.28s)]
*  People wanna jump up and choke us [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=223.48s)]
*  and kill us for being loud. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=227.44s)]
*  How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=231.56s)]
*  And who is he? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=237.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, he sounds like a racist, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=238.72s)]
*  and he's essentially threatening violence [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=241.16s)]
*  if he doesn't get his way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=243.2s)]
*  Nothing's changed from four years ago. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=245.2s)]
*  These BLM radicals don't care [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  about working people in these cities. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=249.56s)]
*  They burned Minneapolis down, didn't care about that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=251.32s)]
*  And they're just trying to cash in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=254.2s)]
*  on their anti-American hatred. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=256.2s)]
*  America has no moral code. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  America has no soul. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=261.08s)]
*  Once we saw those non-white jurors, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=263.2s)]
*  we knew that this case was over. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=265.48s)]
*  Then a special Christmas greeting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=268.32s)]
*  These wonderful white people, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=271.68s)]
*  I hope they celebrate their Christmas [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=273.36s)]
*  while the Neely family is praying [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=275.36s)]
*  and asking God for comfort. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=277.34s)]
*  God f*** them and God f*** America. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=279.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know what she said. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=284.44s)]
*  She must've been a Jeremiah Wright acolyte. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=285.56s)]
*  Well, it got ugly at times outside the courthouse, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=288.44s)]
*  but not inside the pub where Penny's team celebrated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=290.84s)]
*  It feels great, really does. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  So tell me, what's going on right now? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=297.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're just, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=300.08s)]
*  it's 18 months of weight on everybody's shoulders. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=301.56s)]
*  Most importantly, Danny's, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=303.96s)]
*  walking around with the weight of this indictment on him, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=306.2s)]
*  knowing that he's been falsely accused [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=309.54s)]
*  for doing the right thing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=311.06s)]
*  Trump back on the world stage and it's like he never left. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=312.54s)]
*  47 flew over to France this weekend [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=315.38s)]
*  for the reopening of Notre Dame. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=317.62s)]
*  And he said the cathedral looked better [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=320.0s)]
*  than it did 900 years ago. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=322.1s)]
*  But while he had his eyes on the architecture, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=324.66s)]
*  the world had its eyes on him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=327.22s)]
*  Even Dr. Jill couldn't look away. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  The two had a little side chat. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  Trump told the Post, it was very nice. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=334.18s)]
*  She couldn't have been nicer. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  And then he used the photo to promote his new cologne. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=338.78s)]
*  A fragrance your enemies can't resist. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=342.14s)]
*  I know what Johnny wants for Christmas. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=345.58s)]
*  And long lines stretching through the pews [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=348.46s)]
*  to shake 47's hand. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=350.65999999999997s)]

*  right now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=394.14s)]

*  History is going to be a harsh judge. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=485.14s)]
*  This is the culmination of what's really [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=487.5s)]
*  a public humiliation for the party [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=489.7s)]

*  I don't have to tell you this because you've talked about it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=510.3s)]
*  It comes at a time when the country is deeply divided. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  And now you're going to be leading this country [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=516.74s)]
*  for the next four years. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  For the sake of unifying this country, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=520.86s)]
*  will you concede the 2020 election [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=524.1s)]
*  and turn the page on that chapter? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=526.58s)]
*  No. No. Why would I do that? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=528.38s)]
*  But let me just tell you, when you say the country [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=530.94s)]
*  is deeply divided, I'm not the president. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=532.58s)]
*  Joe Biden is the president. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=535.94s)]
*  But you're going to be the president. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=536.94s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm not the president. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=537.98s)]
*  So when you say it's deeply divided, I agree. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=540.38s)]
*  But Biden's the president, I'm not. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=543.1s)]
*  And he has been a divider. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=545.46s)]
*  And you know where he divided it more than anything else, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=547.02s)]
*  and it probably backfired on him, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=549.1s)]
*  I think definitely is weaponization. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=550.78s)]
*  When he weaponized the Justice Department [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=553.38s)]
*  and he went after his political opponent, me, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=555.26s)]
*  he went after his political opponent violently [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=557.58s)]
*  because he knew he couldn't beat him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=559.98s)]
*  And I think it really was a bad thing. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=561.7s)]
*  And it really divided our country. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  Trump just cut through Welkow like warm butter. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=567.14s)]
*  The media and everyone in Washington [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=569.86s)]
*  knows exactly what they're guilty of, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=571.38s)]
*  and they're acting like it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=573.7s)]
*  Bureaucrats are scrubbing their social media [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=575.46s)]
*  and changing their job titles [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=577.5s)]
*  so they don't get fired on day one. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=579.5400000000001s)]
*  The diversity officer at the Treasury Department [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=582.02s)]
*  who posts videos of Rosie O'Donnell, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  that lady better start looking for a new job. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=586.82s)]
*  The resistance doesn't look too confident. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=589.62s)]
*  They're going around like a smash-and-grab crew [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=592.22s)]
*  whose names just went out over the radio. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=594.4599999999999s)]
*  And the media wants to know [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=597.42s)]
*  if all their friends are getting fired. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=598.62s)]
*  Sir, are you going to fire the current FBI Director, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=601.3s)]
*  Christopher Wray, who you appointed? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=603.86s)]

*  He invaded my home. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=608.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm suing the country over it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=610.78s)]
*  He invaded Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=612.66s)]
*  I'm very unhappy with the things he's done. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=616.66s)]
*  You take a look at what's happened. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  And then when I was shot in the year, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=621.42s)]
*  he said, oh, maybe it was shrapnel. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=624.14s)]
*  Where's the shrapnel coming from? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=625.78s)]
*  Is it coming from heaven? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=627.22s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=629.66s)]
*  So we need somebody to straighten. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=631.26s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for the FBI, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=634.98s)]

*  for cash? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=643.66s)]
*  But he is, in fact, confirmed. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=644.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  that if cash gets in, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=648.34s)]

*  Well, I think he's very corrupt, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=691.74s)]
*  but I want her to do whatever she has to do. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  Are you going to direct her to prosecute Jack Smith? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=695.1s)]
*  No, I'm not. She's a very smart person. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=697.4200000000001s)]
*  She was a great attorney general in Florida. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=699.22s)]
*  She's very experienced. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=701.82s)]
*  I want her to do what she wants to do. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=703.22s)]
*  I'm not going to instruct her to do it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=704.7s)]
*  Are you going to do that? Are you going to go after Joe Biden? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=706.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm really looking to make our country successful. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=709.74s)]
*  I'm not looking to go back into the past. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=712.46s)]
*  I'm looking to make our country successful. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=714.38s)]
*  Retribution will be through success. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=718.38s)]
*  The media is goading Trump into prosecuting his opponents [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=720.98s)]
*  because they need the ratings. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=724.38s)]
*  And so they can say, see, I told you so. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=725.86s)]
*  We warned you he's a dictator. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=728.14s)]
*  It'd be the first time the media has been right in 10 years. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  But it seems like Trump's toying with the idea. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=733.3000000000001s)]
*  Cheney was behind it, and so was Benny Thompson. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=736.86s)]
*  And everybody on that committee, for what they did, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=739.9s)]
*  honestly, they should go to jail. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=744.78s)]
*  So you think Liz Cheney should go to jail? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=747.94s)]
*  For what they did. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=750.02s)]
*  Everyone on the committee you think should go to jail. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=751.22s)]
*  I think everybody on the committee. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=752.74s)]
*  Anybody that voted in favor. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=753.54s)]
*  Are you going to direct your FBI director [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=754.7s)]
*  and your attorney general to send them to jail? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=756.5s)]
*  No, not at all. I think that they'll have to look at that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  But I'm not going to. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=760.94s)]
*  I'm going to focus on drill baby drill. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=762.02s)]
*  Trump's like, Liz Cheney should be in jail. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=764.9s)]
*  But I'm not going to tell Pam Bondi what to do. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=767.58s)]
*  Of all the things they did to Trump, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=771.0200000000001s)]
*  he's most mad at Liz Cheney. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=772.86s)]
*  I'd probably be more mad at Alvin Bragg, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=775.62s)]
*  Tish James, Judge Nudy, remember him? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=777.62s)]
*  But that's just me. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=781.1s)]
*  And maybe Kim Cheadle, because that bullet came this close. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=782.94s)]
*  Trump's focused on fairness, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=786.5400000000001s)]
*  whether it's justice, trade, taxes, or immigration. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=788.14s)]
*  You promised to end birthright citizenship on day one. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=792.4200000000001s)]
*  Is that still your plan? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=795.46s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=796.62s)]
*  The 14th Amendment, though, says that, quote, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=798.02s)]
*  all persons born in the United States are citizens. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=800.18s)]
*  Can you get around the 14th Amendment with an executive action? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  Change would maybe have to go back to the people, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=805.98s)]
*  but we have to end it with the only country that has it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=808.54s)]
*  Through an executive action? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=811.02s)]
*  With the only country that has it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=812.14s)]
*  You know, if somebody sets a foot, just a foot, one foot, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=814.0600000000001s)]
*  you don't need to on our land. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=817.58s)]
*  Congratulations, you are now a citizen [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=819.5s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=821.86s)]
*  Yes, we're going to end that because it's ridiculous. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=823.34s)]
*  The crude term for this is anchor baby, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=826.22s)]
*  but we don't use that term here. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=828.14s)]
*  Not all, but some female migrants are motivated by this, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=830.26s)]
*  and it creates an incentive to break into the country. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=833.6600000000001s)]
*  You take that incentive away, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=836.38s)]
*  you cut down the number of illegals. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=837.62s)]
*  You know who really gets hurt by birthright citizenship? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=840.1s)]
*  The foreigners who waited years in line to apply legally. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=843.22s)]
*  Spent money, did it by the book, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=846.5400000000001s)]
*  only to watch caravans cut in line and get rewarded. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=848.1s)]
*  Criminals who break into the country to sell drugs, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=851.74s)]
*  and traffic women shouldn't be handed hotel rooms [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=853.94s)]
*  and debit cards, they should be arrested and flown home. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=856.86s)]
*  And bottom line, they should be scared of getting caught. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=860.62s)]
*  The CEO of Palantir says Trump won [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=864.62s)]
*  because Biden wanted our enemies to love him. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=867.46s)]
*  Trump wants our enemies to fear him. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  Americans are the most loving, God-fearing, fair, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=873.0200000000001s)]
*  least discriminatory people on the planet. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=876.4200000000001s)]
*  And they want to know that if you're waking up [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=878.98s)]
*  and thinking about harming American citizens, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=881.86s)]
*  or if American citizens are taken hostage [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=885.22s)]
*  and kept in dungeons, or if you're a foreign power [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=887.7s)]
*  sending fentanyl to poison our people, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=890.98s)]
*  something really bad is gonna happen to you [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=893.34s)]
*  and your friends and your cousins [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=895.62s)]
*  and your bank account and your mistress [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=897.14s)]
*  and whoever was involved. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=899.02s)]
*  They need to wake up scared and go to bed scared. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=900.42s)]
*  And while the world braces for Inauguration Day, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=903.26s)]
*  Trump is making a promise. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=906.14s)]
*  Listen. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=907.5s)]
*  I remember your first inaugural address. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=908.78s)]
*  You talked about American carnage. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=910.66s)]
*  Have you thought about your message [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=912.66s)]
*  for your second inaugural address? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=914.3s)]
*  I have. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=916.54s)]
*  Can you give us a preview? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=917.86s)]
*  We're gonna have a message. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=918.98s)]
*  It will make you happy, unity. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=919.9s)]
*  It's gonna be a message of unity. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=921.2199999999999s)]
*  And again, I think success brings unity. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=922.6999999999999s)]
*  But we start tonight with breaking news. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=924.78s)]
*  Tonight, justice was served [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=927.3s)]
*  in a New York City courtroom earlier today [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=929.66s)]
*  after the jury found Daniel Penny [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=932.14s)]
*  not guilty of criminally negligent homicide [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=934.3399999999999s)]
*  in the subway death of Jordan Neely. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=938.06s)]
*  Now this comes after the manslaughter charge [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=940.2199999999999s)]
*  was dismissed by the judge on Friday [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=942.38s)]
*  after the jury failed. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=945.02s)]
*  They were deadlocked. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  They failed to come to a unanimous decision. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=947.66s)]
*  Now, the fact that this case was ever brought forward [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  is a complete travesty of justice. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=953.5s)]
*  This is someone, you know, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=956.0999999999999s)]
*  how is this person supposed to react [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=960.06s)]
*  when you have a crazed homeless person [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=963.06s)]
*  with a history a mile long [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=965.62s)]
*  in terms of dealing with cops and authorities [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=968.02s)]
*  in a subway car yelling that he's going to kill himself [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=970.66s)]
*  and everybody else in that subway car? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=974.02s)]
*  Well, that would be a clear and present danger, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=976.54s)]
*  not only to himself, but everyone in the subway [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=978.66s)]
*  and everybody around him. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=981.26s)]
*  Daniel Penny, he stepped in as a brave good Samaritan [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=982.82s)]
*  to protect everyone else in that car. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=986.42s)]
*  As one African-American woman testified to, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=989.5s)]
*  she said, thank you to Mr. Penny for what he did. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=993.8199999999999s)]
*  The charges alone brought by the radical DA, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=998.38s)]
*  Alvin Bragg, represent the blatant weaponization [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1001.74s)]
*  and abuse of our system of justice. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1005.1s)]
*  Then after the jury deadlocked, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1007.54s)]
*  the judge went against New York state law [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1009.02s)]
*  that mandates that DAs choose the charges before the trial [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  and allowed Bragg to eliminate the manslaughter charge [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1016.9399999999999s)]
*  without a verdict, which leads to what the law [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1019.62s)]
*  is intended to prevent, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1022.26s)]
*  which is something called a compromise verdict. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1023.98s)]
*  Now New York courts and this DA [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1026.5s)]
*  are completely out of control. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1028.22s)]
*  This has to end. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1030.06s)]
*  Now following the verdict, Black Lives Matter activists, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  some guy named Hawk Newsome [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1034.22s)]
*  immediately turned up the rhetoric, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1035.7s)]
*  called for race-based retaliation. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1037.54s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1040.34s)]
*  Just like everybody else seeks justice on their own, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1041.62s)]
*  just like everybody else has vigilantes, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1045.34s)]
*  we need some black vigilantes. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1049.78s)]

*  He was killed in the line of duty back in September, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1077.58s)]
*  a drunk driving incident by a Biden Harris, the illegal. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4jNtthD4Lk&t=1080.74s)]
