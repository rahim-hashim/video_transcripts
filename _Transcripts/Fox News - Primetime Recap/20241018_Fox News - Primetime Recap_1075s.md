# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 17, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. A telling tidbit from the New York Post today sheds more light on the friction between Kamala Harris and the man who actually won his party's primaries at Ethel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=6.0s)]
*  Kennedy's funeral. Biden reportedly whispered to Obama. She's not as strong as me. According to this renowned lip reader who analyzed the conversation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=17.0s)]
*  Obama then answered in response. I know that's true. We have time. Well, not a lot. Only 19 days. And there is a building consensus tonight that the political momentum, at least for now, is with Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=27.0s)]
*  He did a Univision town hall yesterday, another hostile forum, and seemed to take it all in stride. No reports that he showed up late or tried to wrap the interview early. That's because he's confident of himself and of his understanding of the issues as complex as they are. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=43.0s)]
*  Now, this is a stark contrast to Kamala in the Fox Dim. And that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=61.0s)]
*  All right. Last night, we shared our instant reaction to Harris's sit down with Brett Baier. But now we have a better sense of just how badly it went for her and her own supporters inside and outside the campaign. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=69.0s)]
*  Oh, they know it. The best that they could do it. I read pretty much everything today. The best they could do was try to portray her as Kamala in the Lions Dim. The media's word of the day. Tough. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=82.0s)]
*  To the end of the day, this is all about one word, the word tough. It showed that Harris was tough. She showed a real toughness by going in there and standing toe to toe and what was clearly an unfriendly venue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=96.0s)]
*  It was aggressive. It was tough. And she was absolutely fine. She has answered Kamala Harris. Every criticism that has come her way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=107.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. She was absolutely fine. Would anyone say that about doctors? Absolutely fine. She answered every criticism. What interview were these people watching? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=115.0s)]
*  Plus, shouldn't we assume that a party's nominee is going to be tough? Isn't that supposed to be kind of a given for this job description? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=128.0s)]
*  I'm sure Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping, they're not tough at all. Putin, no, they're not tough. And if you really are tough, if you really are crushing it in an interview, why on earth would you want your staffers to cut it short? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=137.0s)]
*  But in fact, that's exactly what happened. Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. They're giving me a hard rap. Well, I thank you for the time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=153.0s)]
*  Why didn't Madam Tough Lady wave off her staff when they were waving at Brett to rap? I mean, if again, if you are just dominating an interview, if you're on the top of your game, you're reaching an entirely new audience, then why wouldn't you want it to breathe a little, have a little fun? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=163.0s)]
*  Well, here's some context. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=181.0s)]
*  We were supposed to start at 5 p.m. We, this was the time they gave us. Originally, we were going to do 25 or 30 minutes. They came in and said, well, maybe 20. The vice president showed up about 5 15. I had to dismount there at the end. You know, I'm talking like four people waving their hands. Like it's got to stop. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=184.0s)]
*  It was like the gymnastics like that moving around. Now, obviously, her com staff saw what all of us saw, and it was not pretty. Now, it wasn't that Brett was getting combative. Brett was just doing what journalists used to do. Ask serious questions and yeah, occasionally follow up when questions are actually not answered. It's not that he was combative. It was that she was getting more visibly annoyed the longer it went on. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=203.0s)]
*  Enter the verbal crutch. May I please finish? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=233.0s)]
*  We have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired. So your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions. I'm not finished. I'm not finished. I have to wait to citizenship for the. Yes, ma'am. I finished. May I finish responding? But you have to let me finish. You had the. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=238.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just that her staff should have had her practice answering at least a few questions about her record. Got to answer questions right without using the words Donald Trump. She literally could not do this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=253.0s)]
*  They say the country is on the wrong track. 79% of them. Why are they saying that if you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=270.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been the person holding the office. Madam Vice President. You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. I actually don't. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=278.0s)]
*  That was the best line ever. I actually have no idea what you're talking about. That made no sense. Weak, weak, weak. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=290.0s)]
*  The woman who thinks she deserves to be president showed up late to an interview and then refused to answer straightforward, rather simple questions that she should have answered three months ago. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=297.0s)]
*  So the subtext throughout, I had to watch this again. It was torture. Whenever she was asked about her actual record or actual comments in the past, 2019, what she's trying to say is that I guess they all would have had more success and a lot more consensus. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=309.0s)]
*  If Trump wasn't out there running and running for president and banging the drums, I guess that was her argument. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=326.0s)]
*  Now, she wanted to show the country that she is, in fact, a serious person with serious plans and solutions about how to repair our border and lift up our economy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=333.0s)]
*  But she didn't because she can't. All she could do was what she always does. Grandstand and repeat lines that her consultants had her memorize. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=344.0s)]
*  Now, when Brett brought up the mother who blames Biden and Harris after her daughter was murdered by an illegal, this was the feigned emotion. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=355.0s)]
*  I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I'm so sorry for her loss. Sincerely. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=363.0s)]
*  But let's talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=371.0s)]
*  First of all, when anyone says sincerely, it's like saying frankly. Again, it's Trump's fault. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=380.0s)]
*  This woman's daughter was murdered and she's trying to say it's Trump's fault or, you know, move to Trump, deflect to Trump. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=387.0s)]
*  Again, this is not serious and it's not going to work in international relations. It's not going to work when you're dealing with Congress. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=395.0s)]
*  It's not going to work, period. What is she, 10? That's what my boys do. Oh, it's his fault. No, I deal with that all day long in my house. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=400.0s)]
*  And with all the bromides flying, she sounded like chat GPT trying to mimic Maya Angelou. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=406.0s)]
*  The vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=415.0s)]
*  I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=420.0s)]
*  People are ready to chart a new way forward. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=429.0s)]
*  Chart a new way forward and call him fascist. That's the new rhetoric. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=430.0s)]
*  You know, again, a new way forward, it's more like rinse, repeat, because five minutes earlier, this woman literally could not name one thing she'd do differently than Biden. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=435.0s)]
*  The fact is Harris missed a huge opportunity last night and the best that the print media could do was call the exchange testy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=446.0s)]
*  The Washington Post and New York Times followed suit using a better S.A.T. word, calling the interview contentious. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=456.0s)]
*  Notice what they couldn't say. They couldn't say that she showed a mastery of the facts or that she laid out a bold agenda to differentiate herself from Biden and is on popular record. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=463.0s)]
*  She did none of the above. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=474.0s)]
*  The fact is her staff was desperate to stop the interview because they knew the longer it went on, the weaker she came across. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=477.0s)]
*  They were like trainers at a boxing match throwing a towel on the ring to stop the fight. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=485.0s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=491.0s)]
*  You're looking live at the Al Smith dinner in New York City where they're currently introducing the guests of honor. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=493.0s)]
*  It's an annual charity dinner. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=499.0s)]
*  Politicians show up in election years to roast each other in good humor. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=501.0s)]
*  President Trump's expected to speak tonight. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=506.0s)]
*  Kamala, a no show. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=508.0s)]
*  She's sending a prerecorded video message instead. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=510.0s)]
*  We're also expecting remarks from comedian Jim Gaffigan and an invocation from Timothy Cardinal Dolan. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=514.0s)]
*  And we'll take you there later in the hour. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=521.0s)]
*  Death as a way of bringing people together. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=525.0s)]
*  Today at the funeral of Ethel Kennedy, Bobby's widow, Biden, Obama, Clinton and Pelosi all sat alongside each other for the first time since the coup. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=528.0s)]
*  The bad blood between these four lingering in the church like incense. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=539.0s)]
*  And then things just got awkward. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=544.0s)]
*  I will tell you this. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=546.0s)]
*  I thought your mother was a cat's meow. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=550.0s)]
*  She would flirt with me in the most innocent ways. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=552.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=566.0s)]
*  Anyone else? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=568.0s)]
*  Days later, I received another letter from her. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=570.0s)]
*  I'll always remember. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=573.0s)]
*  I know all of you look forward to each year. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=575.0s)]
*  A Valentine card. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=578.0s)]
*  A Valentine card. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=579.0s)]
*  There's a picture of me and Ethel surrounded by hearts. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=581.0s)]
*  You think I'm kidding. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=585.0s)]
*  I meant a lot to me. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=588.0s)]
*  I'm telling you printed the language on the card. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=590.0s)]
*  I said in the printed language of the card and said, I'm not biding my time waiting for you, Valentine. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=593.0s)]
*  And then in her handwriting, she says, because he's no ordinary Joe. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=602.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=606.0s)]
*  But in the pews, the tension was as powerful as the organ pipes. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=608.0s)]
*  Barack and Biden were caught in the middle of a deep conversation. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=613.0s)]
*  Now, prime time isn't in the lip reading business, but one professional lip reader tells the post that Biden told Barack, she's not as strong as me. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=617.0s)]
*  Barack, nodding his head, seems to agree. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=626.0s)]
*  According to this lip reader, Obama tells him that's true. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=629.0s)]
*  The relationship between these two president is strained. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=631.0s)]
*  Biden's off the ticket and some are second guessing the switcheroo. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=635.0s)]
*  Trump says Obama's feeling like this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=639.0s)]
*  I think he's angry. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=642.0s)]
*  He pretends not to be, but I think he's an angry guy. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=644.0s)]
*  He's a nasty guy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=647.0s)]
*  He's got a little bit of an edge and he's angry about a lot of things. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=649.0s)]
*  You look at what happened with Biden and you look at what he did with Biden. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=654.0s)]
*  He really hurt Biden. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=658.0s)]
*  If you think about it, they stole the election from a sitting president. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=660.0s)]
*  That's, you know, I always say coup, but the word coup, I don't think it's accurate enough. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=664.0s)]
*  They just walked in and took it away from him. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=669.0s)]
*  That is a legendary thing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=671.0s)]
*  He didn't want to give up. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=674.0s)]
*  He's angry now. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=676.0s)]
*  They're all angry. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=678.0s)]
*  The Democrats, if you think she's angry, they're both angry. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=680.0s)]
*  For both men, this is personal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=682.0s)]
*  Kamala's faltering candidacy threatens the end of the Obama Biden era. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=684.0s)]
*  That's how Conrad Black puts it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=690.0s)]
*  They put their legacies on the line for Harris and now they're all pointing fingers at each other. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=692.0s)]
*  Biden's telling Barack, I told you so. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=698.0s)]
*  Pelosi and Biden still aren't even speaking to each other. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=700.0s)]
*  And she says she never wanted Harris in the first place. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=703.0s)]
*  She wanted Josh Shapiro as the nominee. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=708.0s)]
*  That's according to journalist Mark Alpern. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=711.0s)]
*  And the Clintons say we had to have a coronation. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=712.0s)]
*  There's no way Kamala could survive a competition. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=716.0s)]
*  Some of the, you know, the wishful thinking and the speculating about let's have some sort of, you know, primary made absolutely no sense that we didn't have the time and it would not be in any way effective and it would not help us win. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=719.0s)]
*  The old dogs realize they have the party's blood on their hands. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=736.0s)]
*  Less than three weeks to go, they're trying to cut their losses. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=739.0s)]
*  Barack's lecturing the brothers and out on the campaign trail. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=742.0s)]
*  Bubba's teamed up with Tampon Tim. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=746.0s)]
*  I wonder what they talk about on the bus. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=749.0s)]
*  Democrats are nudging Harris to do more. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=752.0s)]
*  So now she's screaming. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=755.0s)]
*  Must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=757.0s)]
*  Never again. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=766.0s)]
*  Never again. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=768.0s)]
*  But it might be too late. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=770.0s)]
*  For the first time ever, the polling averages have trumped up in every swing state. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=772.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=777.0s)]
*  Kamala is fading fast in the betting markets and in early voting is looking strong for Republicans. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=779.0s)]
*  Check out the turnout in Arizona. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=785.0s)]
*  Should note we did not find a single person who was in the polls. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=787.0s)]
*  These were Trump supporters getting out to vote early in the all important Mojave County. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=790.0s)]
*  Take a listen to some of our conversations. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=794.0s)]
*  Well, the difference is going to be that we're everybody's coming out early. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=798.0s)]
*  Why did you vote early this year? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=802.0s)]
*  Honestly, because Donald Trump told me to. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=803.0s)]
*  We went one man who did not vote in 2012. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=808.0s)]
*  We went a man who did not vote in 2012. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=812.0s)]
*  We went one man who did not vote in 2012. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=814.0s)]
*  But he said he was horrified by the state of the country. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=817.0s)]
*  So he is voting here in 2024. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=820.0s)]
*  The Harris campaigns running into reality. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=823.0s)]
*  That's how Walter Samuel puts it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=825.0s)]
*  Harris finds herself burdened by Biden's legacy and with a pointless running mate in October. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=827.0s)]
*  At the very moment, she's triangulated her credibility into the dustbin. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=832.0s)]
*  Half the Harris tickets in a sling. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=838.0s)]
*  Walls is useless. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=840.0s)]
*  And she's out there basically saying the last four years was a failure [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=841.0s)]
*  and never touts any of their so-called accomplishments. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=845.0s)]
*  The only thing she talks about is this. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=849.0s)]
*  Six Democrats. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=853.0s)]
*  The press voted again. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=854.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=855.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=856.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=857.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=858.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=859.0s)]
*  People from Donald Trump. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=860.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=861.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=862.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=863.0s)]
*  About Donald Trump. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=864.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=865.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=866.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump is. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=867.0s)]
*  After George Clinton. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=868.0s)]
*  After George Clinton talking to President Biden at a fundraiser. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=869.0s)]
*  On the debate stage. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=872.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=873.0s)]
*  Let's go back to Donald Trump. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=874.0s)]
*  During Donald Trump. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=876.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=877.0s)]
*  How Donald Trump. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=878.0s)]
*  Usually when a person acts like that, you get a restraining order. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=880.0s)]
*  And she won't take any responsibility for anything. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=884.0s)]
*  She had the chance yesterday with Brett to say what she'd do differently. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=889.0s)]
*  And she flunked. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=892.0s)]
*  Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it's time to turn the page. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=894.0s)]
*  You've been vice president for three and a half years. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=898.0s)]
*  So what are you turning the page from? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=901.0s)]
*  Well first of all turning the page from the last decade. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=904.0s)]
*  In which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=909.0s)]
*  And implemented to divide our country. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=916.0s)]
*  And have Americans literally point fingers at each other. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=919.0s)]
*  That is turning the page. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=922.0s)]
*  Madam Vice President more than 70% of people tell pollsters. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=923.0s)]
*  It's about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of Brett. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=926.0s)]
*  If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=931.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=935.0s)]
*  But you've been the person holding the office. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=938.0s)]
*  Come on. You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=941.0s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=943.0s)]
*  I actually don't. What are you talking about? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=944.0s)]
*  The reason Kamala is the nominee is because Biden was a failure. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=947.0s)]
*  Why can't Kamala just say I learned from the mistakes he made? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=951.0s)]
*  Catch and release was a bad idea. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=954.0s)]
*  Printing a gazillion dollars, I wouldn't do that again. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=957.0s)]
*  Instead she just squirms and argues like a lawyer without a point. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=961.0s)]
*  Grow up, accept the past and move forward. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=965.0s)]
*  Instead she just lies to us. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=969.0s)]
*  Harris has tried to rewrite history and in an implausible way to boot. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=972.0s)]
*  But the idea that Kamala Harris is some sort of glock carrying conservative. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=976.0s)]
*  Who idealized John McCain and admires the statesmanship of Dick Cheney is laughable. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=980.0s)]
*  It is insulting to those involved. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=986.0s)]
*  She's alienating the left and playing the rest of us for fools. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=989.0s)]
*  Harris appears to be in the process of defeating herself. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=994.0s)]
*  Nancy and Barack have unleashed a wrecking ball. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=998.0s)]
*  Biden at least was still kind of holding the coalition together. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1002.0s)]
*  Kamala is poisoning it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1006.0s)]
*  She's lost unions, black men, Hispanics. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1007.0s)]
*  You don't easily put back political coalitions once they've been shattered. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1011.0s)]
*  She isn't just losing voters. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1016.0s)]
*  They're being scooped up by the opposing party. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1019.0s)]
*  These coalitions take decades to build. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1022.0s)]
*  If Kamala loses, this coup will have done long lasting damage to the Democratic Party. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1025.0s)]
*  It's destroyed their coalition and their credibility at the same time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1031.0s)]
*  And it's burning through billions of dollars. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1035.0s)]
*  Writer Tom Klingenstein puts it this way. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1039.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party is the destructive party and Kamala is the destructive leader. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1042.0s)]
*  This election is between one candidate who wants to destroy our country and the other who wants to save it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1048.0s)]
*  Look how much damage Biden Harris did in just four years. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1056.0s)]
*  She's already promised she wouldn't change a thing. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1060.0s)]
*  This country would not survive. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am68KxzV_4M&t=1062.0s)]
