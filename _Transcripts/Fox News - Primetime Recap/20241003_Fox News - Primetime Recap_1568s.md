# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 2, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ)
*  The VP debate last night told you everything you needed to know about Kamala Harris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  She has terrible instincts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=4.92s)]
*  The biggest gut decision I've made most recently is to choose my running mate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=7.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=15.56s)]
*  Tim Walz was supposed to be a normal Midwestern white guy and said this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=16.92s)]
*  Set in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  I've become friends with school shooters. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=25.04s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=26.72s)]
*  What? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=28.72s)]
*  Kamala's right hand man told 40 million people he's become friends with school shooters. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=30.0s)]
*  But he wasn't finished. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=35.48s)]
*  Governor Walz, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=37.76s)]
*  But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=45.68s)]
*  Can you explain that discrepancy? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=54.2s)]
*  I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=56.56s)]
*  And I'm a knucklehead at times. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=59.6s)]
*  The question was, can you explain the discrepancy? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  All I said on this was, is I got there that summer and misspoke on this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  So I will just, that's what I've said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=68.08s)]
*  So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  And from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=78.2s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=84.44s)]
*  Kamala hired a knucklehead who's friends with school shooters to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=87.36s)]
*  You can call that coup insurance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=93.24s)]
*  The assistant coach fumbled the ball twice in the first half and never recovered. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=96.08s)]
*  The Democrats wanted an attack dog and they got a bald basset hound nodding along to everything Vance said. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=100.92s)]
*  Balls kept agreeing that American workers needed to be protected against cartels and big pharma. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=108.52s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=114.8s)]
*  And instead of appreciating American unity, the media said, come on, coach, just play the race card. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=116.08s)]
*  I think the civility that we saw tonight may be a mistake by Democrats, quite frankly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  I talked at the outset of energizing this base. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=129.0s)]
*  I was just in Ohio and many Democrats were livid about what's going on in Springfield. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=132.84s)]
*  I think Walt's missed an opportunity to really push the racial insensitivity there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=138.2s)]
*  There was a sense of trying to be affable, as as John said. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  And I think what we're going to see from this point on is the civility being laid aside. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=148.32s)]
*  Civility was a mistake. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=153.6s)]
*  That's what the Democrats are saying. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=155.64s)]
*  Walls was Minnesota nice instead of Minnesota nasty. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=157.92s)]
*  He must not have gotten the memo. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  You can't be civil to a dictator and not to be superficial. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  But did you know Walls is the same age as Greg? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=166.68s)]
*  Kamala says she's the new generation of leadership. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=170.6s)]
*  Last night, America saw JD Vance as the new generation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=174.44s)]
*  Young, bright, refreshing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=178.8s)]
*  And that's just what the ladies are saying. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=181.72s)]
*  And unlike Walls, Vance came on stage with a theme. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=184.32s)]
*  We're living in Kamala's world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  If you don't like it, don't blame Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=190.56s)]
*  What you won't hear is that Kamala Harris has already done it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=193.72s)]
*  Because she's been the vice president for three and a half years, Kamala Harris has [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=205.6s)]
*  Not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=206.64s)]
*  a half years ago. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that she isn't tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=211.48s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=217.11999999999998s)]
*  Kamala is hiding her record and asking for a promotion that she doesn't deserve. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=222.44s)]
*  At one point, Vance even sympathized with Walls for having to defend her. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=227.12s)]
*  What Tim Walz is doing, and I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=232.72s)]
*  got to play whack-a-mole. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=236.8s)]
*  You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=238.04s)]
*  he did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=242.0s)]
*  You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=243.0s)]
*  did. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=246.68s)]
*  And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=247.68s)]
*  which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=256.4s)]
*  food on the table in our household. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=261.2s)]
*  I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=263.48s)]
*  We can do so much better. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=268.04s)]
*  Women I spoke to love that Vance talked about his family and came across as a common sense [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=270.48s)]
*  conservative who doesn't bow down and just do what he's told. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=276.6s)]
*  I've got three beautiful little kids at home, seven, four and two. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  And I love them very much and I hope they're in bed right now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=284.56s)]
*  But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=287.24s)]
*  are manufactured by nations that hate us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=291.44s)]
*  This has to stop. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=293.88s)]
*  And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=295.68s)]
*  We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=298.24s)]
*  on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=302.28s)]
*  The experts lied to you about Biden's brain and lockdowns working and that crime and border [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=303.28s)]
*  crossings were down and that inflation is just about to go away. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  Vance showed an independent streak that made Americans trust him and a compassionate side [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  that made Americans like him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  Even when he tangled with the moderators, it was done diplomatically. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  who have legal status, temporary protected status. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=332.0s)]
*  But thank you, Senator, we have so much to get to. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=336.04s)]
*  Margaret, I think it's important because the rules were that you guys are going to fact [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=338.76s)]
*  check. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=344.32s)]
*  And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=345.32s)]
*  on. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=348.28s)]
*  So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=349.28s)]
*  apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=354.4s)]
*  Harris open border wand. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=361.52s)]
*  That is not a person coming in applying for a green card and waiting for 10 years. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=363.6s)]
*  That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=367.36s)]
*  Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=371.12s)]
*  We have so much to get to, Senator. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  And then the moderators are muting the mics when Vance tells the truth. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=378.24s)]
*  I don't think that's why the mics were supposed to be muted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=382.8s)]
*  The last two debates, Trump and Vance have shown that they know the issues better than [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  the moderators. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  These last four network moderators have been wrong about everything. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=393.04s)]
*  Crime, immigration, late term abortion. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=396.48s)]
*  They don't know anything. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  It's because they go in with just a note from a liberal producer that just says this is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  what's going to shut down the conversation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  Little fake fact check. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=409.24s)]
*  But instead of complaining about the media bias, JD kept the focus on you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  Every American, whether they're rich or poor, ought to be able to turn on their heat in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=417.72s)]
*  the middle of a cold winter night. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=421.6s)]
*  That's gotten more difficult thanks to Kamala Harris's energy policies. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=423.32000000000005s)]
*  I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford a nice meal [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  for your family. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=430.72s)]
*  That's gotten harder because of Kamala Harris's policies. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=432.0s)]
*  I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford to buy a house. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=435.0s)]
*  You ought to be able to live in safe neighborhoods. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=438.44s)]
*  You ought to not have your communities flooded with fentanyl. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=440.48s)]
*  And that too has gotten harder with Kamala because of Kamala Harris's policies. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=443.56s)]
*  The JD Vance hoax is over. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  The media told you he was a creepy weirdo who offended women. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=450.98s)]
*  But last night, Americans saw a polished, clean-cut, mature young man. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=454.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, the kind of guy a girl can take home to their parents. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=460.42s)]
*  That's why the media smeared him so you wouldn't get to know him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=465.62s)]
*  They told you Vance was a bad pick just to discourage you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=468.54s)]
*  And now we know he's the perfect balance for the Trump ticket. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  Last night enlarged the Republican Party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=478.06s)]
*  The Republican independence, they liked what they saw. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=480.86s)]
*  Moderate Republicans loved Vance. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=483.98s)]
*  People see Vance as the future. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=487.46s)]
*  Vance's presentation gives fence-sitters a sense of security. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  Because Trump had a little trouble picking personnel the first time around. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=494.52s)]
*  Now there's evidence that Trump will surround himself with high-quality people. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  And this goes without saying, but the base loved him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=503.0s)]
*  Loved. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=505.78s)]
*  He humanized wings of the Republican Party, articulated the America First agenda exquisitely, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=506.9s)]
*  and even softened Trump, if that was possible. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  Frank Luntz's focus group had Vance winning 12 to 2. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=517.9399999999999s)]
*  He's very battle-tested, very ready. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=522.1s)]
*  And you can just see that he went to Yale and he's very intelligent. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=524.22s)]
*  And he reassured a lot of people, I think. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=527.5s)]
*  Somebody else. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=529.98s)]
*  It was his strong control of the facts. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=530.98s)]
*  He ran the show. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  He remained steady during the whole performance. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=536.26s)]
*  And I was very impressed with him being very sincere and authentic. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=540.0200000000001s)]
*  He humanized himself and actually looked like a regular guy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=545.22s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=549.22s)]
*  Vance even won over some on the left. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=550.22s)]
*  I'm a lifelong Democrat. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=553.5s)]
*  I thought that Vance really showed he's a very vibrant, brilliant young man who has [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=554.5s)]
*  total control of the issues. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=561.32s)]
*  The system is broken. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=563.34s)]
*  And as, as Senator Vance said, Harris could do something tomorrow. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=565.7s)]
*  She could wake up in the morning and do something tomorrow. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=570.1800000000001s)]
*  The change agent is really going back to successful Trump administration. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=573.7800000000001s)]
*  We can't hold out for the perfect. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=579.34s)]
*  We have to vote for the good. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=581.9s)]
*  And I think Trump would be the good. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=584.7800000000001s)]
*  Bottom line, Vance helped his ticket. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  Walz hurt his. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=589.5400000000001s)]
*  Americans were delighted and pleasantly surprised by the respectful exchange of ideas. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=591.46s)]
*  Imagine that voters don't want to see a cable news shootout on a presidential debate stage. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=596.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump proved that he can spot talent. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=604.14s)]
*  Harris proved that she can. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=606.62s)]
*  Democrats were somewhat satisfied with Walz, but not thrilled. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=608.7s)]
*  He's not helping with men, whites, unions, and didn't shine under the lights. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=613.34s)]
*  If her running mate's a knucklehead, who's she going to have in the cabinet? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=620.02s)]
*  If she can't make good decisions for herself, how's she going to make a good decision for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=623.74s)]
*  you? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=628.14s)]
*  This race is very close, and small swings in momentum can make a huge difference just [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=629.4s)]
*  five weeks from election day. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=635.3s)]
*  The Democrats are caught in an ugly news cycle now, and last night, it got worse. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=638.02s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight we have a jam-packed show. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=644.06s)]
*  The former first lady will join us with an in-depth look into what the Trump family has [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=648.0600000000001s)]
*  faced over the past several years and her views on this upcoming election a mere 34 [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=652.1s)]
*  days away. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=657.14s)]
*  Also, big new poll numbers for Donald Trump, who appears to be picking up momentum with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=658.14s)]
*  just a short time until election day, although early voting, of course, is rolling out around [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=664.0600000000001s)]
*  the country. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=668.22s)]
*  Later, we will also check in with Sarah Carter. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=669.22s)]
*  She is in Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=672.26s)]
*  North Carolina has been devastated and in many ways abandoned, where the death toll [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=674.34s)]
*  continues to rise following the devastation from Hurricane Helene. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=679.36s)]
*  Now, after a weekend of star-studded fundraisers and lavish parties with her friends on the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=683.74s)]
*  West Coast and Hollywood, Kamala Harris finally found the time to tour some damage in the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=689.26s)]
*  Southeast. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=694.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala likely regrets picking fellow radical leftist governor Tim Walz as [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=695.34s)]
*  a running mate. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=701.24s)]
*  The joy seems most definitely gone after last night's debate. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=702.48s)]
*  Now, we know why the Harris campaign, you know, keeps Walz very far away from the media. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=706.32s)]
*  He doesn't do interviews. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=711.72s)]
*  We know why, because he can't. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  The governor is a complete and total, well, frankly, buffoon. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=715.62s)]
*  He is way over his head, kind of like she is. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=718.94s)]
*  He is way out of his league. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=721.32s)]
*  And Walz looked like a deer in the headlights, so visibly nervous. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=723.44s)]
*  He did not have command of the facts. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=727.24s)]
*  He seemed ill-prepared. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=728.94s)]
*  He said some pretty weird, bizarre things. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=730.6s)]
*  There aren't many people, you know, that call themselves a knucklehead in the middle of [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=733.52s)]
*  a debate or brag about being friends with school shooters. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=737.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=741.32s)]
*  Governor Walz, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=742.74s)]
*  in the spring of 1989. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=747.74s)]
*  But Minnesota public radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=750.58s)]
*  travel to Asia until August of that year. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=754.86s)]
*  Can you explain that discrepancy? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=759.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  up in small rural Nebraska, a town of 400, a town that you rode your bike with your [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=765.28s)]
*  buddies until the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=770.6s)]
*  Now look, my community knows who I am. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=773.28s)]
*  They saw where I was at. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=775.84s)]
*  They – look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=777.28s)]
*  I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=781.84s)]
*  And I'm a knucklehead at times. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=785.08s)]
*  I will say more than anything, many times I will talk a lot. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=786.5s)]
*  I will get caught up in the rhetoric. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=790.94s)]
*  But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=793.54s)]
*  Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=798.26s)]
*  No, just – all I said on this was, is I got there that summer and misspoke on this. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  So I will just – that's what I've said. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=807.7s)]
*  I think another word for that is called lying. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=812.34s)]
*  And he didn't, by the way, have to even answer why he wants feminine products in boys' bathrooms [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  or gender-affirming care for children without parental consent. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  His bizarre position on abortion, yeah, he lied about abortion. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=825.04s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  His legal driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the country. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=830.8s)]
*  Free college for illegals also. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, and did I mention free sex change operations and amnesty too? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=836.68s)]
*  On the other hand, J.D. Vance, senator from Ohio, he was a rock star last night. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=841.5799999999999s)]
*  Upbeat, confident, detailed, smart, compassionate. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=846.0999999999999s)]
*  He looked – totally looked competent. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  And this was another three-on-one debate with two very liberal, left-wing, arrogant, pompous [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=852.2199999999999s)]
*  moderators who were clearly trying to tip the scales in Tim Wall's favor. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  Almost every question tainted with Democratic talking points. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=862.78s)]
*  It was a question about climate change before any mention of the economy or illegal immigration. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=865.9799999999999s)]
*  And despite promising not to fact-check the candidates, the moderators played by the rules. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  They constantly attempted to insert their own so-called facts after answers only from [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=876.4799999999999s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  In the end, it didn't matter. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  Vance was able to rise above it, call him out. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=885.1999999999999s)]
*  On X, people even joked that Tim Wall's look ready to vote for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=888.0s)]
*  after last night's performance. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=893.76s)]
*  I'd like to agree with Senator Vance on that, which was pretty funny. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=895.8s)]
*  Following the debate when J.D. Vance headed to the spin room to answer more questions, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=899.56s)]
*  Tim Walls, while he scurried off to grab some pizza, needed a little comfort food where [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=903.9799999999999s)]
*  he tried very hard to avoid any and all questions about his horrific debate performance. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=909.2199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=914.0999999999999s)]
*  Governor, you said you'd become friends with school shooters during the debate. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=915.0999999999999s)]
*  Can you clarify what you meant on that? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=918.0999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=919.66s)]
*  Can you clarify what you meant when you said you'd be friends with school shooters? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=922.18s)]
*  Why didn't you say you were in Hong Kong when reports say you weren't? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=925.66s)]
*  I'll take the school shooter special, please. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=933.92s)]
*  It's so bizarre. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  Today in Pennsylvania, when asked again to clarify his comments about being friends with [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=941.28s)]
*  school shooters and his bizarre word salads about one of his many trips to China, his [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=945.28s)]
*  outright lying, he still struggled to come up with a simple answer. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=950.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=954.42s)]
*  Do you want to clarify the comments that you made about school shooters? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=955.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=958.9s)]
*  And look, you got to see me. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=959.9s)]
*  These folks know me. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=961.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm super passionate about this. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=962.74s)]
*  The question come up about school shooting, we're talking about everything except school [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=964.3399999999999s)]
*  shootings. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=967.6999999999999s)]
*  And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=968.6999999999999s)]
*  movement. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=972.9s)]
*  David Hogg is a good friend of mine. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=973.9s)]
*  You have seen me do this. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=975.56s)]
*  I was talking about being people where there are school shooters. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=976.74s)]
*  Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=980.1s)]
*  I was in Hong Kong and China in 1989. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=985.06s)]
*  That move from Hong Kong into China, it was profound for me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=992.66s)]
*  That was the summer of democracy. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=995.4599999999999s)]
*  Looks like John Fetterman. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=998.26s)]
*  Is that him behind him? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=999.26s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted to know part of that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1000.26s)]
*  Smart move on his part. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1001.9799999999999s)]
*  Now, when a Democrat is facing critical questions from the state-run media mob, you know it [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1003.26s)]
*  was a horrible night. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1007.9799999999999s)]
*  As it turns out, Tim Walz has a lot of trouble when it comes to telling the truth. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  Remember last night he lied about Project 25. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1013.66s)]
*  He called it a Trump plan. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1017.3s)]
*  Trump has nothing to do with it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1019.14s)]
*  Lied about a scary new abortion registry that Trump and Vance do not support. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1021.18s)]
*  Lied about his own position on abortion and is radical. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1026.26s)]
*  Yeah, you can have abortions up to the moment of birth. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1030.34s)]
*  And then there's that little pre and post-birth position that he did take in that bill. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1033.9s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1039.3s)]
*  He also told some egregious lies about the border. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1040.46s)]
*  Walz actually wants you to believe that illegal crossings are down under Biden and Harris, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1043.26s)]
*  which as you can see from that little chart there, you see that big spike increase? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1048.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's a total lie fabrication also. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  He lied about taxes, pretending that only the wealthy would pay more under Harris and [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1055.74s)]
*  Walz, when in reality it would be the middle class that would be hit the hardest if the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1060.1s)]
*  Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1065.62s)]
*  In fake news CNN, they were forced to admit the obvious. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1068.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1071.62s)]
*  Vance clearly, I think it needs to be said clearly, the more experienced debater, the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1072.62s)]
*  slicker speaker. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1078.4199999999998s)]
*  JD Vance came to this debate to land a bunch of punches and he did. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1080.74s)]
*  He landed a lot of punches in between all the niceties and all of that. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1085.78s)]
*  And the thing that really stood out to me was that Tim Walz did not seem prepared for it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1090.5s)]
*  I think the lack of interviews that he has done with national media, with local media, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1095.42s)]
*  it showed he needed more rest. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1102.22s)]
*  Two issues driving the campaign right now are Harris has a big deficit on the economy, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1103.9s)]
*  Harris has a big deficit on immigration, and Republicans were happy tonight and Democrats [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1108.6200000000001s)]
*  a little bit nervous that on those two issues Vance carried it. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1112.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean it's pretty clear Vance outclassed Walz tonight. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1116.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean I was watching this and all I could think of was man, Walz is so in over his head. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1120.18s)]
*  And while fake news CNN is grappling with reality, the far left lunatics at MSDNC, well [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1125.6200000000001s)]
*  was absolute fit of hysteria. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1131.42s)]
*  It was funny for all the wrong reasons on their part. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1133.7s)]
*  They lost it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1137.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1138.76s)]
*  It's the audacity. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1139.76s)]
*  I agree with you that we're in year nine and no one knows how to cover the audacity. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1140.76s)]
*  The audacity is that someone should have said stop it, stop, stop. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1146.3400000000001s)]
*  Are you effing kidding me? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1151.18s)]
*  And they should have dropped that ep bomb, right? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1152.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean they should have just, this is a debate, this may be the only chance people have to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1155.06s)]
*  see the difference. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1159.9s)]
*  And instead, I mean I'll go back to my toothpicks, JD Vance just put one little toothpick on [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1160.9s)]
*  top of the other and said and I'm for this and I'm for this and I'm so sorry those women [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1164.6200000000001s)]
*  died. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1168.66s)]
*  They died because of Donald Trump. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1169.66s)]
*  And so I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1170.8600000000001s)]
*  Party. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1174.18s)]
*  Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1175.5s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1180.54s)]
*  But that is not the group of people who need this debate. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1181.66s)]
*  I think they might want to consider a free Xanax for the host at MSDNC. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1185.94s)]
*  And of course MSDNC's liberal viewers can always, always count on America's number one [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1191.34s)]
*  tin foil hat conspiracy theorist, Rachel Maddow, to lie straight to their faces and protect [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1197.02s)]
*  them from any and all truth. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1203.94s)]
*  And last night she delivered big time, once again proclaiming a great victory for Tim [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1206.22s)]
*  Walls, only one in the country that thought that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1212.1399999999999s)]
*  But take a look. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1214.94s)]
*  I think the big picture takeaway from this is that one of these candidates is much slicker [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1216.5s)]
*  than the other, is a much more practiced kind of professional debate style speaker and the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1222.1399999999999s)]
*  other candidate won. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1227.78s)]
*  Hillbilly elegy, really? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1230.78s)]
*  Anyway, that's almost as believable as our year and year long obsession with the Russia [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1232.62s)]
*  hoax, the Russia hoax, the Russia hoax. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1238.1799999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Politico was also serving up some truly insane propaganda. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1240.54s)]
*  They actually claimed that Walls' wide-eyed, deer in the headlights look of sheer terror [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1245.1s)]
*  and panic was actually a sign of passion and intensity. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1249.5s)]
*  Wow, they had to stretch to make that one up. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1253.58s)]
*  And you know, at the same time, by the way, the same Politico reporting that JD Vance's [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1256.6599999999999s)]
*  beard is triggering to women in America, quote, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1261.18s)]
*  ideals. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1269.1s)]
*  I wonder who they're voting for. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1270.1s)]
*  But if you really need any more evidence that JD Vance crushed Tim Walls during last night's [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1272.34s)]
*  debate, take a look at this headline from the New York Times, quote, Vance's dominant [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1277.34s)]
*  debate performance shows why he's Trump's running mate. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1282.48s)]
*  Mark my words, this will have an impact on what is a very close race, as Senator Vance [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  pointed out competently last night at leadership matters. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1291.4s)]
*  By the way, after nearly four years under Biden and Harris, are you better off than [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1296.1999999999998s)]
*  you were four years ago? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  Is the economy better off or the border is better off? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1301.7199999999998s)]
*  Are your towns and cities safer? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1304.76s)]
*  How do you like paying a dollar plus more per gallon of gasoline? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1307.76s)]
*  And how do you think we're doing on the world stage? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1311.6s)]
*  How is that war in Europe going? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1313.9599999999998s)]
*  We're on the verge of a complete, you know, breakout of war in the Middle East. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  We know that Harris is incompetent and it looks and it feels like nothing but incompetence. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  You're not better off than you were four years ago. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1325.84s)]
*  Our country is far worse off. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  The world is a far more dangerous place. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1330.6999999999998s)]
*  And under Donald Trump, in spite of their predictions of the death of democracy, well, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  everything was better. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1338.56s)]
*  We didn't have war in Europe. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1340.04s)]
*  We didn't have war in the Middle East. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1341.1999999999998s)]
*  We didn't have Iranian mullahs and their proxies, you know, creating havoc and shooting off [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1342.8999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of ballistic missiles. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1349.9599999999998s)]
*  Their proxies and Iran themselves were bankrupt. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1352.1999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump held them in check. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1355.52s)]
*  They were probably about on the verge of going under. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1357.76s)]
*  But under Biden, well, billions of dollars were unfrozen and deposited in the accounts [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1360.92s)]
*  of the Iranian mullahs. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1366.48s)]
*  The Islamic Republic made billions and billions, thanks to Harris and Joe Biden, after their [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1368.08s)]
*  sanctions were either eased or they just simply turned a blind eye to them and never enforced [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1373.68s)]
*  them. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1378.48s)]
*  Harris and Biden made Iran rich again so that they can then foment murder and terrorism [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1379.48s)]
*  worldwide, which we've been watching. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1385.04s)]
*  In 2021, Biden-Harris, they even lifted sanctions on two Iranian missile producers. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1386.04s)]
*  And of course, they brought back that idiotic Iranian deal, which puts them on a path to [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1392.36s)]
*  becoming a nuclear power. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1396.24s)]
*  And now our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, they are now fighting a multi-front [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1398.6s)]
*  war, while Iranian missiles rained down on Tel Aviv and all throughout Israel. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1403.3999999999999s)]
*  And the idiotic Biden-Harris plan to appease the Iranian mullahs has been an abject failure. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1408.44s)]
*  But to this day, they refuse to change tactics. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1414.64s)]
*  Here's Biden. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1417.16s)]
*  You know, here they got attacked with nearly 200 ballistic missiles, a massive escalation. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1418.16s)]
*  And what has been going on? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1423.28s)]
*  They're not using their proxies, Hamas in the south, Hezbollah in the north, the hooty [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1424.28s)]
*  rebels. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1428.96s)]
*  No, they're going with ballistic missiles straight at Israel. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1429.96s)]
*  But what's Joe's advice? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1432.88s)]
*  What it's always been, please show restraint, please show restraint. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1434.88s)]
*  No, don't attack their nuclear facilities. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1438.72s)]
*  I promised them they could pursue nuclear power. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1442.1999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1445.3999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Iran has gone way out of, I mean, it's way off the port. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to put together a joint statement, hasn't been done yet. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1452.3999999999999s)]
*  It'll be done before too long, probably by the time we land. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's going to be some sanctions imposed on Iran. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1459.3999999999999s)]
*  Will you support an attack on Iran's nuclear sites by Israel? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  The answer should be yes. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1469.72s)]
*  You know, sanctions, what, like the ones you lifted, you're going to put a couple of them [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1472.72s)]
*  back in place. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1476.72s)]
*  Here's what the United States of America, if we had strong leaders, what their message [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1477.72s)]
*  would be. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1482.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, Joe hasn't spoken to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump has, but the message [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  should be clear, unambiguous. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1489.2s)]
*  Go win your war against those radical Islamic terrorists that attacked your country, murdered [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1491.52s)]
*  your citizens, kidnapped them, raped them, tortured them and beheaded them. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1498.72s)]
*  Even if Kamala doesn't ever want you to say the words radical Islamic terrorism or illegal [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1503.6s)]
*  alien. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1508.56s)]
*  Now, if Biden, Harris get their way, it's only a matter of time before the world's number [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1509.56s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror will start producing nuclear war warheads. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1514.44s)]
*  And the odds I would bet are very high they would use them. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  How does that benefit anybody in the world? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1522.72s)]
*  How does that contribute to global peace? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  The Harris Biden administration is actively putting our country and the entire world at [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1528.44s)]
*  risk with their appeasement policies that are at the very least naive, but far worse [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1533.4s)]
*  sinister in my view. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1539.2s)]
*  It's not too late to reverse course in 34 days and sooner for those of you that vote [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1540.96s)]
*  early, you can right the ship. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1547.36s)]
*  You can get our country back on track. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1549.64s)]
*  You can restore America's role as the leader of the free world. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jv1ulJqLJQ&t=1552.0s)]
