# Fox News Highlights - May 1st, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0)
*  First, we're not going back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=2.04s)]
*  We all know that, God, thank you so much, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=5.84s)]
*  Trump missed a bullet at Butler. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  But now we know without a doubt [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  that America missed a bullet when he beat Kamala Harris. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=14.24s)]
*  It was appropriate that her first big speech [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=18.68s)]
*  since blowing it was in San Francisco, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=21.04s)]
*  a monument to liberal failure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=24.04s)]
*  Hi, everyone. Hi. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=26.6s)]
*  Oh, it's just in the house! [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=31.2s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Oh, hi. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=33.6s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=39.2s)]
*  Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=41.4s)]
*  And Dougie's here, too! [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  This is such an embarrassment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=51.8s)]
*  And the Democrats who have real power, they know it, too. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=54.6s)]
*  But they don't care. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  The Kamala show never got good reviews. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=59.4s)]
*  Going back to the 2020 primary, they all knew [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=63.2s)]
*  she was always a problem, never a solution. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=66.2s)]
*  And the words written in the liberal Atlantic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=70.6s)]
*  ring as true today as they did in the fall of 2023. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=72.8s)]
*  Ease and confidence have not been the prevailing themes [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=77.6s)]
*  of Harris's vice presidency. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=81.0s)]
*  Her first year on the job was defined by rhetorical blunders, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=83.0s)]
*  staff turnover, political missteps, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=86.0s)]
*  and a poor sense among even her allies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=88.4s)]
*  of what exactly constituted her portfolio. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=91.6s)]
*  Within months of taking office, President Joe Biden [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=95.0s)]
*  was forced to confront a public perception [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=97.2s)]
*  that Harris didn't measure up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=99.8s)]
*  And she never did, including last night. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=104.6s)]
*  The American people deserve leaders [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=110.0s)]
*  who make their lives better [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=114.2s)]
*  and make our country stronger. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=118.2s)]
*  But sadly, we have seen quite the opposite [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=123.6s)]
*  over these past few months. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=130.0s)]
*  Crickets. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=136.0s)]
*  But she kept on mightily trying to recapture [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=137.5s)]
*  her fleeting political moment from last August [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=140.7s)]
*  when she described the pace of Trump's agenda. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=143.1s)]
*  What we are in fact witnessing is a high-velocity event [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=147.1s)]
*  where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=156.5s)]
*  of an agenda that has been decades in the making. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=163.9s)]
*  An agenda to slash public education. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=169.5s)]
*  An agenda to shrink government and then privatize its services. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=174.9s)]
*  All while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, mind you, this was her crowd. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=185.3s)]
*  They paid to be there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=193.3s)]
*  And they didn't exactly give her a hero's welcome. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  Again, the Kamala problem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=197.3s)]
*  Nothing she said was really landing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=200.4s)]
*  I watched the entire thing, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  and then she started talking about animal videos. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=203.3s)]
*  Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=207.0s)]
*  The one of the elephants at the San Diego Zoo [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=209.5s)]
*  during the earthquake? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  Google it if you've not seen it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=216.5s)]
*  So that scene has been on my mind. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=220.7s)]
*  And as soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=223.5s)]
*  they got in a circle and stood next to each other [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=228.7s)]
*  to protect the most vulnerable. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=234.5s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=238.9s)]
*  What a powerful metaphor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=240.5s)]
*  Because we know those who try to incite fear [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=244.9s)]
*  are most effective when they divide and conquer, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=252.3s)]
*  when they separate the herd. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=258.7s)]
*  But in the face of crisis, the lesson is don't scatter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=262.5s)]
*  Okay. Unheard. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=271.9s)]
*  Now, if we want to keep that strange metaphor going, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=275.9s)]
*  that's Kamala being trampled by her own incompetence [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=278.9s)]
*  or maybe bad writers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=281.9s)]
*  First of all, elephants protect their young. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=282.9s)]
*  And her party's policies endanger our young from womb to tomb. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=285.9s)]
*  First, abortion on demand. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=291.9s)]
*  They might not even survive. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=293.9s)]
*  Then, terrible schools, teachers unions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=294.9s)]
*  Then, dangerous streets, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=296.9s)]
*  bad permissive on crime policies, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=298.9s)]
*  trans surgeries, pot legalization. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=300.9s)]
*  Then, when the kids grow up, they can look forward to offshore jobs, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=303.9s)]
*  communities with more criminal aliens, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=307.9s)]
*  more drugs from open borders, and flatlining wages. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=309.9s)]
*  Harris' party, they thrive off of dividing the American herd, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=315.9s)]
*  our nation, by race, sex, ethnicity, country of origin, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=320.9s)]
*  into classes of victims instead of patriots. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=325.9s)]
*  Remember, that's what DEI is all about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=329.9s)]
*  Plus, it didn't matter how bad, though, Harris was last night [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=332.9s)]
*  or as a candidate in 2024. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=336.9s)]
*  Forget the animal analogies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=338.9s)]
*  Remember, the candidates don't even matter to the Democrats anymore. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=340.9s)]
*  They were willing to keep, you know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=345.9s)]
*  the weekend at Biden's presidency going as long as possible. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=347.9s)]
*  They only stopped it when he just flatlined in the debate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=351.9s)]
*  But they thought the country was doing fine [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=355.9s)]
*  when Biden and Mayorkas were flooding the border with millions of illegals. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=357.9s)]
*  They only slowed that down for political reasons when the polls were so bad. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=361.9s)]
*  And they were fine, frankly, with inflation, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=366.9s)]
*  and they loved high gas prices, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=368.9s)]
*  and they loved showering Zelensky with borrowed money [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=370.9s)]
*  even when Ukraine wasn't winning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=373.9s)]
*  So none of the challenges, the real challenges facing America, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=376.9s)]
*  which they either caused or exacerbated, none of it mattered to them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=380.9s)]
*  So no one should be surprised that Harris goes out last night [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=385.9s)]
*  still thinking that, yes, she has a shot. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=389.9s)]
*  All the party wanted in 2020 with Biden and 2024 with Biden and then Harris [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=394.9s)]
*  was a figurehead president who'll do whatever the permanent bureaucracy wants. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=399.9s)]
*  And that's what they're going to push in 2028, too. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=404.9s)]
*  So, of course, with the other 2028 prospects, expect mostly vibes, little substance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=408.9s)]
*  I miss Obama and I miss her husband, too. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=415.9s)]
*  I will build this world from love. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=418.9s)]
*  I will build this world from love. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=422.9s)]
*  All vibes, all stunts, no substance. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=428.9s)]
*  And who can forget his pointless filibuster? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=433.9s)]
*  I don't want a disneyfication of our history. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=436.9s)]
*  We're marching through, we're marching through. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=440.9s)]
*  13 hours, I got more in the tank. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=443.9s)]
*  They're all Kamala Harris now. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=447.9s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=450.9s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=466.9s)]
*  Thank you. I respect a crowd that recognizes talent. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=471.9s)]
*  Happy Thursday, everyone. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=476.9s)]
*  So speaking to Democrats in San Francisco last night, Kamala Harris criticized the Trump agenda [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=478.9s)]
*  and she urged Democrats to band together to find her a designated driver. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=483.9s)]
*  She also went on a bizarre rant about elephants. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=488.9s)]
*  Thanks for the shout out, said this herd. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=492.9s)]
*  You saw it coming. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=498.9s)]
*  No, I don't want your sympathy applause. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=500.9s)]
*  Steve Doocy is dead. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=507.9s)]
*  Tired of getting up in the morning. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=509.9s)]

*  Now let's take a look at some of these hoaxes. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=742.9s)]
*  We'll begin as all things should with transgender mice. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=744.9s)]
*  CNN tried to fact check Trump for claiming Biden spent millions to perform trans experiments [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=748.9s)]
*  on these rodents. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=753.9s)]
*  But turns out Trump was right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=754.9s)]
*  They really were turning to the right direction. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=756.9s)]
*  They really were turning many into Mickey. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=758.9s)]
*  Little mustache. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=763.9s)]
*  Excellent work. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=764.9s)]
*  Remember the astronauts stuck in space for months. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=765.9s)]
*  The hacks at NPR stopped calling them stranded once Trump and Musk said they were going to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=767.9s)]
*  save them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=772.9s)]
*  And then they did. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=773.9s)]
*  Elon got it back so fast he didn't have enough time to impregnate him. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=774.9s)]
*  And there's the media trying to claim Trump was the only world leader wearing a blue suit [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=781.9s)]
*  at the Pope's funeral. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=784.9s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=786.9s)]
*  Reminds me of that story about me wearing a thong at a public pool. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=787.9s)]
*  It was a G string. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=794.9s)]
*  And what of the label Marilyn Dad? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=796.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's like calling the Unabomber a quirky pen pal. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=799.9s)]
*  Then there's the attacks on Doge. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=804.9s)]
*  For weeks we heard Doge is cutting Social Security when in reality they twisted Musk's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=806.9s)]
*  words. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=811.9s)]
*  He was talking about cutting waste. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=812.9s)]
*  I haven't seen anything that dishonest since Rachel Levine published her pap smear. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=814.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=822.9s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=823.9s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=825.9s)]
*  Now the media screams that Trump wrongfully deported three kids who are US citizens, one [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=829.9s)]
*  of which had cancer. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=834.9s)]
*  But here's Marco setting the record straight. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=835.9s)]
*  Three US citizens ages four, seven and two were not deported. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=839.9s)]
*  Their mothers who are legally in this country were deported. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=842.9s)]
*  The children went with their mothers. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=845.9s)]
*  So first they moaned that ICE was separating families and now they're bitching when they [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=847.9s)]
*  keep them intact. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=851.9s)]
*  Cue the fat bastard. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=853.9s)]
*  Instead of enabling the administration's illegal and unconstitutional mass deportation [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=855.9s)]
*  scheme, we could be holding hearings on why US citizens as young as two years old are [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=859.9s)]
*  being deported with no meaningful due process. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=864.9s)]
*  Of course, Nadler was upset the kids were gone. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=867.9s)]
*  He was planning on eating them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=870.9s)]
*  So nothing's changed since Trump walked down the escalator. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=872.9s)]
*  The hoax are endless. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=876.9s)]
*  Russia gate, Hunter's laptop, find people on both sides. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=877.9s)]
*  Joe's as sharp as a tack. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=880.9s)]
*  The media will repeat lie after lie in service to their masters, the Dems. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=882.9s)]
*  No wonder Trump treats them with the same respect dogs give hydrants, which means it's [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=886.9s)]
*  time for. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=892.9s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=894.9s)]

*  It's true. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=900.9s)]
*  Here he is kicking some ABC ass. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=905.9s)]
*  Do you think the reputation of the United States has gone down under your presence? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=908.9s)]
*  I know I think it's gone way up and I think we're a respected country again. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=913.9s)]
*  We were left at all over the world. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=917.9s)]
*  We had a president that couldn't walk up a flight of stairs, couldn't walk down a flight of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=919.9s)]
*  stairs, couldn't walk across the stage without falling. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=924.9s)]
*  We had a president that was grossly incompetent. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=927.9s)]
*  You knew it. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=929.9s)]
*  I knew it and everybody knew it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=930.9s)]
*  But you guys didn't want to write it because you're fake news. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=932.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=935.9s)]
*  ABC is one of the worst. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=936.9s)]
*  I have to be honest with you. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=938.9s)]
*  Say it with me. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=941.9s)]

*  OK, anything. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=954.9s)]
*  Do I have 100 percent? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=955.9s)]
*  It's a stupid question. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=956.9s)]
*  Look, it's a pretty important position. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=958.9s)]
*  I have no, no, no. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=960.9s)]
*  You don't have 100 percent. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=962.9s)]

*  We don't deserve him. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=973.9s)]
*  He's right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=975.9s)]

*  But it wouldn't be a Trump interview if he didn't really twist the knife. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=982.9s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=986.9s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=988.9s)]
*  I picked you because frankly, I never heard of you, but that's OK. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=989.9s)]
*  We don't deserve him. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1001.9s)]
*  He's such a giver and they have no choice but to take it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1003.9s)]
*  After fomenting fake existential calamities, Trump has exposed them for what they really are, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1006.9s)]
*  an outdated self-serving medium that creates their own false truth based on bias and ego. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1012.9s)]
*  They're an industry marred with hoaxes and accuracies and of course, leprechauns. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1017.9s)]
*  So in that interview, it wasn't Trump being graded. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1023.9s)]
*  Trump doesn't have to prove anything. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1026.9s)]
*  It's the media which has everything to prove and nothing to show for it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1028.9s)]
*  Let's welcome, Kat Ike! [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1033.9s)]
*  Yes! [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1035.9s)]
*  Women call him their better half because they take half his stuff after writer, comedian Jamie LaSalle. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1038.9s)]
*  I have hate mail! [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1046.9s)]
*  Older than he is, GOP Youth Advisory Council co-chair, CJ Pearson. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1048.9s)]
*  In her previous life, she was a kilo of cocaine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1054.9s)]
*  Outnumbered co-host, Emily Campagno. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1057.9s)]
*  And he's like a nap. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1061.9s)]
*  Old ladies like to take him in the afternoon. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1064.9s)]
*  New York Times' Beth Saleh, author, comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyronn Is. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1067.9s)]
*  Jamie, obvious statement, your marriage was a hoax. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1075.9s)]
*  What do you make of this hoax list? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1079.9s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, I'm feeling a little bit unsettled. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1082.9s)]
*  The producers told me you were missing a graphic for the beginning of your show [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1085.9s)]
*  and they took me in the back and took a picture of my penis. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1088.9s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Greg. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1097.9s)]
*  If there's so much wrong with Trump and he's so bad, why do they have to make stuff up? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1099.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1103.9s)]
*  Like why do they have to make stuff up? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1104.9s)]
*  Like when we never doctored a video to show Biden falling, he provided us with unlimited footage of him falling. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1106.9s)]
*  Yes! [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1111.9s)]
*  And it's very frustrating that they do a thing where they take part of the truth. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1112.9s)]
*  Like yes, it's true that a child did leave the country, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1117.9s)]
*  but it was because the mother got to choose if they went with him or not. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1120.9s)]
*  But they just take part. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1123.9s)]
*  This reminds me of what my ex-wife would do. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1124.9s)]
*  I remember my ex-wife would tell everyone she was monogamous. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1126.9s)]
*  And yes, it is true, she was sleeping with only one man, but it wasn't me. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1130.9s)]
*  It's sad, but it's true, which makes it funny. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1134.9s)]
*  If it wasn't real, it wouldn't be funny. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1139.9s)]
*  It would just be a stupid story, but it's real, making it hilarious. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1142.9s)]
*  CJ, isn't it great that they keep a list? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1145.9s)]
*  I mean, we've been doing that for a while, but it's nice that the White House has a hoax list. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1150.9s)]
*  You know, it's a very long list and deservedly so. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1154.9s)]
*  You know, if we're going to define the last hundred years as the last hundred years, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1157.9s)]
*  then we ought to define the media's coverage the last hundred days. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1160.9s)]
*  And if they're bumping their gums, they're probably lying. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1162.9s)]
*  You know, everything from their attempt to gaslight the American people [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1165.9s)]
*  into believing that some El Salvadorian gangbangers, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1168.9s)]
*  just some docile Maryland man, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1171.9s)]
*  and that we're deporting American children has been a lie. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1173.9s)]
*  When they show you who they are, believe them the first time. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1177.9s)]
*  And what we know to be true is that these people truly are lying. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1180.9s)]
*  And I think that's a good point. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1183.9s)]
*  I love the phrase bumping gums. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1185.9s)]
*  That's like date night at the Villages. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1189.9s)]
*  It's where I spend my summers, Greg. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1192.9s)]
*  I kid the Villages. They're my biggest fans. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1195.9s)]
*  Emily, Emily, Emily, thank you for doing that little thing and reading through the list. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1198.9s)]
*  Did you learn anything? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1201.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1203.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1205.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1207.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1209.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1211.9s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1213.9s)]
*  Did you learn anything while doing that? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1215.9s)]
*  I was thinking about that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1217.9s)]
*  It was like I didn't retain anything other than the first one, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1219.9s)]
*  a couple in the middle, and then the end. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1222.9s)]
*  You could definitely do the side effect stuff for drug commercials. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1225.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1228.9s)]
*  Because we didn't speed up that footage. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1230.9s)]
*  That was me in real time. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1232.9s)]
*  Oh, you don't have to tell me that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1234.9s)]
*  Should we clap? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1236.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1238.9s)]
*  So here's our thing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1240.9s)]
*  It goes to your point about how they are making up stuff. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1242.9s)]
*  The thing is that the media cuts away from anything President Trump is doing always. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1246.9s)]
*  So take today, when he had an entire speech at the Rose Garden, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1250.9s)]
*  it was National Prayer Day, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1253.9s)]
*  they cut away within two seconds and started having analysts on, not talking about it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1255.9s)]
*  So the reason that they can create these hoaxes [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1258.9s)]
*  and then further it amongst themselves is because they're not going to be able to do it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1261.9s)]
*  The reason they can create these hoaxes and then further it amongst themselves only [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1265.9s)]
*  is because they've never even covered the truth. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1269.9s)]
*  There's absolutely no material for them to draw from [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1272.9s)]
*  because they refused to cover the president like we talked about at the dinner, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1275.9s)]
*  where it was as if President Trump didn't exist. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1278.9s)]
*  And I love his 100% point of view, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1281.9s)]
*  because it's the point of view of a man who was almost assassinated [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1284.9s)]
*  and had a bullet clip his ear. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1287.9s)]
*  He's like, you can never be 100% sure of the next breath in your life. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1289.9s)]
*  And I love the material for him cutting down the representative, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1293.9s)]
*  the meek, tiny, unnameless representative of that entire estate [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1296.9s)]
*  that has tried to dismantle him since day one. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1300.9s)]
*  The unnameless. I think I know what you mean by that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1303.9s)]
*  I made it up. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1306.9s)]
*  I know you did. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1307.9s)]
*  You know, Tyrus, the analogy I keep thinking of, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1309.9s)]
*  the media is a guy with no bullets in his gun who keeps firing at you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1311.9s)]
*  It's like they keep thinking these things are going to work, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1316.9s)]
*  but the bullets, there's none. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1319.9s)]
*  They have bullets in the gun, they just don't see good. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1321.9s)]
*  They just shoot, because all their stuff causes damage. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1324.9s)]
*  So they're not shooting blanks. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1329.9s)]
*  Like I wish I might have been at one point in my life. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1332.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1338.9s)]
*  What? I used to like to do country western movies. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1341.9s)]
*  F***ing sick. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1346.9s)]
*  You're referring to the unfortunate Alec Baldwin experience. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1348.9s)]
*  Thank you. You scared me. Shook the life out of me. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1352.9s)]
*  You didn't even have to shake the life out of somebody. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1354.9s)]
*  What we're finding, the longer this goes, is that, one, they're not going to change. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1357.9s)]
*  What we talked about a little bit last night, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1362.9s)]
*  so those of you who tuned in, you'll get it, those of you who didn't, tough s***. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1365.9s)]
*  They're going to continue to just throw things. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1371.9s)]
*  And what do liars do? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1374.9s)]
*  Everybody who's had to deal with a liar in your family, in your life, in a relationship, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1376.9s)]
*  they take one sentence from a truthful statement and they expand on it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1380.9s)]
*  And that's what they do. So they always will have something to try to drag out. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1384.9s)]
*  They'll continue to do this until something sticks. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1387.9s)]
*  So there's no reason to change. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1390.9s)]
*  And again, the only criticism I would have to President Trump when it comes to trolling, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1393.9s)]
*  there's nobody better. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1397.9s)]
*  But stop calling them fake news. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1399.9s)]
*  We have to call them what they are. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1402.9s)]
*  The propaganda machine of the enemy within, which is the extreme left. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1404.9s)]
*  That's who they are. That's who they work for. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1408.9s)]
*  They work together. So they're not going to change, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1411.9s)]
*  because I guarantee they'll have meetings going, we only got to wait this out. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1414.9s)]
*  Once Trump is gone, we're going to be fine. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1417.9s)]
*  So we'll just keep attacking and attacking. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1420.9s)]
*  And that's why their hoaxes, their point out lies. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1422.9s)]
*  Now we need to look at everything that was made, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1426.9s)]
*  that was every claim that was made that was crazy, that was all these things. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1430.9s)]
*  We need to go back and look at everything now, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1434.9s)]
*  because now we're seeing the connective tissue is the media and the left. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNmdmD0xQV0&t=1436.9s)]
