# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 10, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8)
*  But first, a pen and a phone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=3.2s)]
*  All right, they say that when you're in quicksand, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=5.44s)]
*  the worst thing you can do is flail about. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=10.68s)]
*  Come here! Come here, come here, come here! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Don't! Don't! Don't! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Come here, come here! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=17.92s)]
*  Get out of here! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=20.32s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=23.52s)]
*  And this same ugly fate is befalling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=24.76s)]
*  today's Democrat Party. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=27.0s)]
*  We have to be able to have the stomach [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  to stand up to this would-be dictator [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  that is running roughshod all over our government [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  right now through Elon Musk. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  Y'all know he likes to pound around with Putin, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=38.92s)]
*  He's trying to turn us into Russia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  But I got news for him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=45.84s)]
*  We, the people, will not go! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  All right, instead of calmly examining [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=52.64s)]
*  their own political troubles, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=55.2s)]
*  then making the necessary tweaks or adjustments, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=56.92s)]
*  Democrats are just dispatching their most radical players [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=59.92s)]
*  to make the same failed points that didn't work in 2024. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  But now, instead of just Trump being an evil despot, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  well, Elon Musk is one, too. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=72.04s)]
*  Every time you hear Doge, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=74.64s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=77.6s)]
*  you just remember it is the Department of Government Evil. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=81.2s)]
*  This will be a congressional fight, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=85.4s)]
*  a constitutional fight, a legal fight, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=88.4s)]
*  and on days like this, a street fight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  We've got to meet the wickedness where it is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=95.0s)]
*  Leave federal employees alone! [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=98.0s)]
*  Oh, threatening fights in the street, are they? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, only in the insane liberal clown posse world [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  would volunteering to save taxpayers billions of dollars, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=109.72s)]
*  which is what Musk is doing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=114.04s)]
*  could in any way be considered wicked. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=115.76s)]
*  But Democrats feel that they found their footing, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  with Vox proclaiming that their anti-Trump resistance [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=121.84s)]
*  may finally be waking up, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=125.48s)]
*  focused on Musk's methodical [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=128.12s)]
*  and swift disemboweling of federal bureaucracy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=130.52s)]
*  Leah Greenberg, a top progressive organizer, has said, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=134.44s)]
*  if you don't create friction, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=138.32s)]
*  then the American people don't understand [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=140.32s)]
*  exactly how bad and how dangerous this is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=142.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=144.84s)]
*  Now, you can expect weeks of astroturf activists [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=146.28s)]
*  showing up to protect the corruptocrats [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=149.64s)]
*  who are burrowed into every agency of our government. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=151.8s)]
*  Your fight, my fight, our fight, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=156.44s)]
*  and we will win this fight. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=160.44s)]
*  Are you ready to say no to Elon Musk? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=163.04s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=166.44s)]
*  Are we gonna fight? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=167.48s)]
*  Fight! [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=168.76s)]
*  Are we gonna win? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=170.96s)]
*  Is this our country? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=171.8s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=173.0s)]
*  Shrieking for big government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, today it was the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=176.96s)]
*  which gets its funding via the Federal Reserve. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=180.68s)]
*  Now, to give you a sense of how partisan [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=183.44s)]
*  that place has become, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=185.52s)]
*  in December, its chief rushed to file several lawsuits [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=187.36s)]
*  against the payment platform Zelle, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=192.0s)]
*  JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  alleging this amorphous failure to protect consumers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=198.44s)]
*  is ridiculous, and it amounts to another shakedown [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=201.48s)]
*  of business by anti-capitalist crusaders. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=204.44s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=206.64s)]
*  Now, think of it this way. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=208.16s)]
*  The same Democrats who caused inflation to skyrocket [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=210.0s)]
*  and who hid Biden's decline, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=214.32s)]
*  they now want you to think that they care [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=216.6s)]
*  about protecting your bottom line. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=220.12s)]
*  And as for their sudden concern [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=223.04s)]
*  with the use of executive orders to get things done, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=224.76s)]
*  they're all worried about that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't recall they had any problem [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=229.48s)]
*  when their hero, Barack Obama, flexed his Article 2 powers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=232.8s)]
*  We are not just going to be waiting for legislation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=237.64s)]
*  in order to make sure that we're providing Americans [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  the kind of help that they need. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=244.52s)]
*  I've got a pen and I've got a phone, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=246.6s)]
*  and I can use that pen to sign executive orders [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=249.48s)]
*  and take executive actions and administrative actions [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=253.24s)]
*  that move the ball forward. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=255.76s)]
*  I got a pen, I got a phone. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, the press and Democrats loved it, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=261.2s)]
*  Because that was quintessential Obama cool under pressure. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=263.24s)]
*  And of course, Democrats cheered [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=268.12s)]
*  when Joe Biden used executive orders [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=270.04s)]
*  to wipe away billions in student loan debt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=272.36s)]
*  Courts ultimately stepped in to hobble the Biden moves. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=275.44s)]
*  But Warren and Schumer, remember, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=279.16s)]
*  they didn't care at all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=280.6s)]
*  Back then, they were not only not complaining [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  about the executive orders, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=284.8s)]
*  they pushed Biden to issue them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=286.64s)]
*  And she even put out a press release about it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=289.8s)]
*  So Trump right now is just following precedent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=292.36s)]
*  He's doing exactly what the Democrats supported for years. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=295.76s)]
*  We're actually getting rid of a few programs [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=300.56s)]
*  that are just a waste, just really a waste. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, liberals are up in arms [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=308.4s)]
*  when Trump uses his own executive authority [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=310.8s)]
*  after campaigning and winning on a platform [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=312.96s)]
*  to cut government waste. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=315.84s)]
*  It's hypocrisy, and it's a hyperbole alert. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=318.4s)]
*  What we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  This is the most serious constitutional crisis [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=325.32s)]
*  the country has faced, certainly since Watergate. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=327.28s)]
*  The president is attempting to seize control of power [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=329.76s)]
*  and for corrupt purposes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  This is a red alert moment when this entire country [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  has to understand that our democracy is at risk. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, imagine having that guy, Chris Murphy, as your senator. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=343.04s)]
*  It's my home state of, my old home state of Connecticut. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=347.72s)]
*  It breaks my heart. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  So your state is sinking. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=351.92s)]
*  It's bleeding manufacturing jobs due to high taxes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=354.12s)]
*  in Connecticut and a terrible anti-business climate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  And Murphy's answer to all of that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=361.28000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, it's just a propaganda loop. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=367.68s)]
*  And we've heard it for years. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=369.36s)]
*  Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne is letting it on thick, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=371.08s)]
*  describing Trump with the A-word, authoritarian. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=374.28s)]
*  Do they have amnesia? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=380.0s)]
*  Do they not recall what happened last time [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=381.96s)]
*  they went down this road? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump won't hold autocrats accountable [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  because he wants to be an autocrat himself. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=388.56s)]
*  Not only did he win the election. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=392.2s)]
*  Our CBS poll finds that a majority of Americans, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=396.44s)]
*  53%, approve of the job he's doing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=399.2s)]
*  That's a better approval number than he ever reached [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=402.4s)]
*  during his first term in the White House. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  But, of course, he's more popular than ever. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=408.2s)]
*  And instead of demanding answers [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=411.96s)]
*  from the irresponsible bureaucrats, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=413.64s)]
*  what the Democrats do and their media friends [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=415.96s)]
*  is they hassle those who are bringing the waste to light. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=418.52s)]
*  Now that we start to find out some of the programs [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=422.8s)]
*  that AID has been funding, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=424.64s)]
*  if you think about it, sex change operations in Guatemala, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=426.32s)]
*  LGBTQ programs in Serbia, this is ridiculous. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=430.04s)]
*  This is so beyond the pale. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=432.32s)]
*  The US government does not fund [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=433.96s)]
*  sex change operations or fund Hamas. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=435.56s)]
*  You know that though. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=436.96s)]
*  But you sit on- [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=438.88s)]
*  That is not true, Margaret. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=439.88s)]
*  I couldn't get the Secretary of State, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=440.92s)]
*  I asked him three times to tell me [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=442.32s)]
*  that we were not funding Hamas through AID. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=444.08s)]
*  He couldn't do it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=446.08s)]
*  Don't these anchors supposed to care about facts at all? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=446.92s)]
*  Haggerty schooled CBS. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the headline there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=453.2s)]
*  Why weren't there investigative teams at CBS, at NBC, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=455.4s)]
*  all the networks, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=459.0s)]
*  why weren't they uncovering the waste that Musk has found? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=460.68s)]
*  Aren't there things called FOIA requests? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=464.76s)]
*  Don't they care? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=467.48s)]
*  And don't Democrats also want to be known as good stewards [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=469.08s)]
*  of the taxpayer money? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=472.12s)]
*  Or do they think they can grow their base, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=474.2s)]
*  improve their appeal to young and minority voters [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=476.2s)]
*  by being the protectors of the bureaucracy, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=479.12s)]
*  of DEI, of climate change giveaways? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=482.76s)]
*  That's going to grow your party? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=485.32s)]
*  Look, no one seriously thinks Trump and Musk [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=487.88s)]
*  are trying to tear down democracy, no one. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=490.04s)]
*  But most Americans sure want them [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=492.88s)]
*  to tear down the bureaucracy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  And the more evidence of waste that Musk and his team uncovered, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=497.32s)]
*  the more powerful the argument [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=501.04s)]
*  for a major downsizing of federal spending. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=503.44s)]
*  And this is what Democrats and their media poodles truly fear. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=507.12s)]
*  They fear an informed electorate, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=511.92s)]
*  the curtain pulled back, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=514.04s)]
*  and the corruption exposed. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=516.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=518.24s)]
*  One in five Democrats say Trump's doing a good job. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  Even Democrats hate paper straws. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  We're going back to plastic straws. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  These things don't work. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=528.0s)]
*  I've had them many times. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=529.84s)]
*  And on occasion, they break, they explode. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  If something's hot, they don't last very long, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  like a matter of minutes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=537.36s)]
*  Sometimes a matter of seconds. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a ridiculous situation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=540.64s)]
*  So we're going back to plastic straws. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=543.0s)]
*  I think it's okay. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=545.8s)]
*  And I don't think that plastic's gonna affect a shark very much [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=547.92s)]
*  as they're eating, as they're munching their way [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=551.92s)]
*  through the ocean. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=553.8s)]
*  Real men should never use straws, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=556.12s)]
*  so it doesn't affect primetime. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=558.12s)]
*  And Trump says Hamas has a deadline. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=560.72s)]
*  Listen. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=564.12s)]
*  If all of the hostages aren't returned [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=565.72s)]
*  by Saturday at 12 o'clock, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=567.92s)]
*  I think it's an appropriate time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=571.04s)]
*  I would say cancel it and all bets are off [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=573.04s)]
*  and let hell break out. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=576.92s)]
*  You say all hell is going to break loose. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=579.04s)]
*  Are you speaking about retaliation from Israel? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=580.92s)]
*  You'll find out. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=583.92s)]
*  And they'll find out too. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=585.12s)]
*  Hamas will find out what I mean. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=586.24s)]
*  Voters know what the press doesn't. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump isn't radical. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  He's just radically changing our country back to normal. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=592.12s)]
*  No guys and girls sports, cutting waste, fraud and abuse, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=595.24s)]
*  deporting migrants and securing the border. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=598.52s)]
*  All common sense moves. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=600.72s)]
*  But saboteurs inside the federal government [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=602.84s)]

*  Pam Bondi says if you get in the way, you're going down. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  If anyone leaks anything, people don't understand [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=610.84s)]
*  that jeopardizes the lives of our great men [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=613.72s)]
*  and women in law enforcement. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=616.12s)]
*  And if you leaked it, we will find out who you are [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=617.72s)]
*  and we will come after you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=620.24s)]
*  While Bondi smokes out moles, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  the president's pinching pennies for far too long. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  The United States has minted pennies, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=626.64s)]
*  which literally cost us more than two cents. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=628.52s)]
*  This is so wasteful. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  I have instructed my secretary of the US treasury [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=632.92s)]

*  even if it's a penny at a time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=640.64s)]
*  Wishing wells and fountains hardest hit. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=643.64s)]
*  Trump has options that other presidents never considered. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  The federal government has thousands of properties [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=649.48s)]
*  in our real estate portfolio that aren't being used [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=652.04s)]
*  and millions of acres of federal land. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=655.0s)]
*  Trump could sell this property off for trillions [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=657.52s)]
*  and trim down the debt. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=660.48s)]
*  But first, we need to stop the bleeding. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=662.12s)]
*  Well, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  of money that's going to places where it shouldn't be going, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=667.48s)]
*  where if I read a list, you'd say, this is ridiculous. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=669.92s)]
*  And you've read the same lists [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=672.76s)]
*  and there are many that you haven't even seen. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=673.96s)]
*  It's crazy. It's a big scam. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=676.0s)]
*  Now, there's some good money [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=677.6s)]
*  and we can do that through any one of a number. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=679.48s)]
*  I think I'd rather give it to Marco Rubio [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=682.4s)]
*  over at the state department. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=684.92s)]

*  So I don't know if it's kickbacks or what's going on, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=688.88s)]
*  but the people, look, I ran on this [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=691.08s)]
*  and the people want me to find it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=693.6400000000001s)]
*  And I've had a great help with Elon Musk, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=695.84s)]
*  who's been terrific. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=698.24s)]

*  In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=712.44s)]
*  He's so into it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=714.48s)]
*  But I told him to do that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  Then I'm gonna tell him very soon, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=717.12s)]
*  like maybe in 24 hours, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=719.1600000000001s)]

*  He's gonna find the same thing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=724.08s)]
*  Then I'm gonna go to the military. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=725.6s)]
*  Let's check the military. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=727.4s)]
*  We're gonna find billions, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=728.48s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=730.24s)]
*  But I campaigned on this, Brett. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=733.32s)]
*  It's easy finding fraud. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=735.52s)]

*  How USAID got to the top of the Doge list, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  I think is one of the most interesting aspects [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=743.96s)]
*  of this story. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=746.48s)]
*  So if you remember, on January 21st, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=747.72s)]
*  Trump decided he would do a bunch of executive orders, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=750.96s)]
*  and one of them was to pause foreign aid for 90 days. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=754.0s)]
*  Okay, a couple of days later, the White House said, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=757.36s)]
*  hey, this USAID leadership [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  is trying to circumvent the executive order. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  In other words, they're just gonna keep paying people [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=765.0s)]
*  even though the executive order came out. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=766.88s)]
*  That alerted the Doge team. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=769.96s)]
*  Mm. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=772.2s)]
*  FEMA spent 59 million in New York [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=773.12s)]
*  to feed and house Biden migrants. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=775.68s)]
*  Remember how illegals were staying here at swanky hotels [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=778.36s)]
*  and throwing out the free food? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=781.08s)]
*  Probably would have been better spent on hurricane [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=782.88s)]
*  or wildfire victims. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=784.68s)]
*  Instead, Biden funneled the money to midtown hotel owners. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=786.56s)]
*  Those hotels booked up full for a whole year, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=790.52s)]
*  then no one could get a hotel room in the whole city, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=793.32s)]
*  and other hotels jacked their prices up. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=795.48s)]
*  And the government wasted 100 grand studying snapping. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=798.72s)]
*  Ready? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=804.08s)]
*  Scientists concluded this, quote, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  varying degrees of friction between the fingers [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=806.08s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=813.6s)]
*  Doge is ending a $2 million military program [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=815.08s)]

*  Not too long ago, they thought shrinking the government [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=832.36s)]
*  was a great idea. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=835.1600000000001s)]
*  With changes in technology, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=837.28s)]
*  the ability to evolve to government as a service, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=840.12s)]
*  as a libertarian, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=842.12s)]
*  I think we can reduce employment in government [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=843.36s)]
*  by at least a third, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=846.24s)]
*  reduce the overhead administration by that much or more, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=847.28s)]
*  so that we can offer more to services for our citizens. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=852.12s)]
*  But now that Trump's making cuts, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=858.2s)]
*  Democrats are defending waste for art and abuse. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=860.36s)]
*  The deeper they dig, the worse they look. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=864.08s)]
*  Doge pulled back the curtain, and now there's no going back. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=866.36s)]
*  While most of the country makes an honest living, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=869.76s)]

*  like Pelosi's face on a hot day, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=888.36s)]

*  CHEERING [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1088.52s)]
*  Guy, if I may call you that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1092.92s)]
*  What's up, Guy? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1095.0s)]
*  I am wearing it. Pray your request. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1096.24s)]
*  Oh, I thank you! [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1097.88s)]
*  LAUGHTER [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1099.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1101.52s)]
*  What a difference a four years... eight years makes. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're cheering him. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1106.88s)]
*  It is kind of surprising that this is the first time [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  a president has been to a Super Bowl. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1110.88s)]
*  I feel like if I were president, that would be my number one thing. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  I'd say, all right, the campaign was awful, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  people hate me, there are threats against me, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1118.92s)]
*  damn it, I'm going to a Super Bowl. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1121.52s)]
*  And no one had done it before this guy. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1123.12s)]
*  And I was not sure he would get that reception, honestly, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1125.08s)]
*  because people were saying, well, he was cheered [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1127.68s)]
*  at his previous football game appearances. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1129.56s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, well, that was in Alabama. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1131.2s)]
*  Yeah. And at the Army-Navy game. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1132.96s)]
*  So this one was a tougher test, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1134.76s)]
*  because you had at least half the crowd as Philadelphia fans, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1136.56s)]
*  and they booed everything. Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1139.12s)]
*  They booed Santa Claus. That's a real thing that they did. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1140.76s)]
*  And they're all actually criminals and should be deported to Gitmo, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1143.04s)]
*  but that's a separate story. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1146.16s)]
*  I don't think you'll get any disagreement here. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1148.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, there was one guy I saw in an Eagles thing in the crowd, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1150.04s)]
*  and he's been asked to leave already. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1153.16s)]
*  Oh, that was Jesse. At my request. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1154.76s)]
*  But I do think that that was a moment where it's like, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1156.76s)]
*  okay, things have changed. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1159.76s)]
*  They said, we can never normalize Donald Trump, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1162.3600000000001s)]
*  and the most normal thing ever is a president being cheered [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1164.76s)]
*  at the biggest American event of the year, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1169.24s)]
*  and it's Donald Trump. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1171.44s)]
*  So that whole push is dead. It has failed. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1172.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know what's interesting? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1176.08s)]
*  Jim, if I may call you that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1177.64s)]
*  I like it, but spell it G-Y-M. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1179.44s)]
*  Ha-ha-ha-ha! [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1181.4s)]
*  Because a lot of men love to work out on you. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1183.0s)]
*  You know... [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1185.0s)]
*  Ha-ha-ha-ha! [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1187.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1189.0s)]
*  Maybe that joke was always back there waiting to come out. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1191.0s)]
*  Ha-ha-ha! [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1194.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1195.0s)]
*  You know what's interesting, though? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1196.0s)]
*  It's like, if you look at what Guy just said, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1197.4s)]
*  there's something distinctly American about Trump [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1200.6000000000001s)]
*  that we all suddenly kind of realized. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, the Super Bowl is big and loud, so is he. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1206.0s)]
*  And it's kind of like everybody's, I think, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1209.56s)]
*  come to the conclusion that, you know what? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1211.56s)]
*  He's about as American a president you're gonna ever find. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1213.56s)]
*  A host of a reality show. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1216.56s)]
*  A concert... You know what I mean. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1219.56s)]
*  Yeah, and he's also... He's willing just to say [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1221.56s)]
*  who he likes in the game. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1223.56s)]
*  Like, there's something very basic about a guy [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1225.56s)]
*  who is willing just to go, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1228.56s)]
*  I like Patrick Mahomes. He likes me. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1230.56s)]
*  So, uh... I hope they win. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1232.56s)]
*  You know, I like them a lot better. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1235.56s)]
*  There's something... First of all, I think he only got [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1238.12s)]
*  those tickets because he's president. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1240.12s)]
*  I tried to get tickets, they were sold out, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1242.12s)]
*  and all of a sudden, he gets them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1244.12s)]
*  So, it's all bullsh... But, um... [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1246.12s)]
*  The fact that he... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1248.12s)]
*  He's the sitting president of the United States, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1250.12s)]
*  and he trolled Taylor Swift. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1252.12s)]
*  Like, there's something very relatable about that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1254.12s)]
*  Like, that's exactly what I would do [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1257.12s)]
*  if somebody trashed me publicly, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1259.12s)]
*  and I got cheered and they didn't, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1261.12s)]
*  and I'd go, eh... [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1263.12s)]
*  But I'm not the president of the United States. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1265.12s)]
*  He does, yes. You may not be the president, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1267.6799999999998s)]
*  but he is you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1269.6799999999998s)]
*  So, he doesn't forget that she endorsed Kamala [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  and then made a big stink about it, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  and now he goes, ah, I have... [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1275.6799999999998s)]
*  He is us. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1277.6799999999998s)]
*  Which, I don't know if that's good or not. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1279.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, when I think of myself, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm like, do I really want me running the country? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, there'd be a major crisis, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  and I'm looking at porn at two o'clock in the morning. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1287.6799999999998s)]
*  Kat? Yes? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1293.6799999999998s)]
*  Taylor Swift deserve this. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1295.68s)]
*  No. Okay, here's the thing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1297.68s)]
*  Plenty more people than just teenage girls [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1299.68s)]
*  like Taylor Swift. She's extremely... [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1301.68s)]
*  Gay men? No, she's extremely popular. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1303.68s)]
*  No, she's extremely popular. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1305.68s)]
*  It is funny that she got booed. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1307.68s)]
*  I mean, like, I think that's just objectively true [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1309.68s)]
*  that it's funny, but I don't think it had to do [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1311.68s)]
*  with politics as much as people are [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1313.68s)]
*  so sick of the Chiefs. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1315.68s)]
*  People are so sick of the Chiefs. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1317.68s)]
*  Chiefs fans are even sick of the Chiefs, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1319.68s)]
*  which is... [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1321.68s)]
*  I don't think there were that many of them there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1323.68s)]
*  Like, I think they were like, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1325.68s)]
*  we're tired of being in the Super Bowl. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1327.68s)]
*  So, I think that had more to do with it than politics. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1329.68s)]
*  They were sick of her as well. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1331.68s)]
*  Well, I... But didn't she ask [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1333.68s)]
*  to, like, not be on camera anymore? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1335.68s)]
*  I think she might be a little sick of herself at this point. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1337.68s)]
*  But you know when somebody asks not to be on camera? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1339.68s)]
*  That's even a humble brat. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1341.68s)]
*  You can't relate to that at all. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1343.68s)]
*  I always say, no pictures. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1345.68s)]
*  No pictures. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1347.68s)]
*  They know that. They'll know I'll throw them out. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1349.68s)]
*  I don't know. I just... And I'm not a Taylor Swift fan. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1351.68s)]
*  I wish I were, because I wish I could feel [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1353.68s)]
*  the things I see the people feeling [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1355.68s)]
*  when they see her. Like, they get so excited. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1357.68s)]
*  Adults who are Taylor Swift fans [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1359.68s)]
*  are like adults who go to Disney [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1361.68s)]
*  and go have kids. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1363.68s)]
*  No, no, no. Adults... There's something deeply wrong [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1365.68s)]
*  with adults who don't go to Disney without kids. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1367.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1369.68s)]
*  That, I do not... I do not stand behind that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1371.68s)]
*  You know, the worst ones are the people that go there [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1373.68s)]
*  without kids and then leave with kids. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1375.68s)]
*  No, no argument there, Gray. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1377.68s)]
*  Very tall, very astute. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1379.68s)]
*  Tyrus, did you find the Super Bowl [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1381.68s)]
*  a different kind of tone or mood than normal? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1383.68s)]
*  The entire week was different. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1385.68s)]
*  Okay, first of all, I found out [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1387.68s)]
*  that I'm a celebrity. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1389.68s)]
*  And the worst time to ever be a celebrity. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1391.68s)]
*  Because no one gives a s*** [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1393.68s)]
*  anymore if you're a celebrity. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1395.68s)]
*  The only people who really cared [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1397.68s)]
*  was like Fox, like, look, look at the celebrities [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1399.68s)]
*  at her game. And America was like, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1401.68s)]
*  move, the little Kevin Hartz fan. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1403.68s)]
*  America was like, move, the little Kevin Hartz [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1405.68s)]
*  in the way of the field. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1407.68s)]
*  They don't care. America's back. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1409.68s)]
*  America's the celebrity. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1411.68s)]
*  When you see the soldiers, you cheer. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1413.68s)]
*  When you see police officers, you go, thank you for still being here. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1415.68s)]
*  It's a completely different vibe. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1417.68s)]
*  And everyone is kind of walking around like [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1419.68s)]
*  they walked out of the house naked [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1421.68s)]
*  and the neighbor said, nice job. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1423.68s)]
*  Looking good, man. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1425.68s)]
*  You've been working out? Because no one's afraid [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1427.68s)]
*  to speak their mind anymore. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1429.68s)]
*  Listen, I've been a Black [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1431.68s)]
*  celebrity for a long time. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1433.68s)]
*  I've been a Black celebrity for a long time. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1435.68s)]
*  I'm a black celebrity for a long time. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1437.68s)]
*  I'm a black celebrity forever. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1439.68s)]
*  And there was a good stretch where I was Uncle Tom, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1441.68s)]
*  couldn't be on TV, nothing, this, that, whatever. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1443.68s)]
*  And if I didn't see another brother, he was like, hey, good job, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1445.68s)]
*  but don't say hi to me. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1447.68s)]
*  They were coming out, the Woodworks literally, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1449.68s)]
*  Lawrence Taylor, Marcus, all these NFL legends. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1451.68s)]
*  Tyrus, who was that? Flavor Flav, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1453.68s)]
*  screaming at the red carpet. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1455.68s)]
*  Tyrus, I watch you every night. I love you. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1457.68s)]
*  I love the Guthriell show. How's Kat? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1459.68s)]
*  I'm like, man, I said, where the hell have y'all been? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1461.68s)]
*  And they said, look, you ran through the woods for us. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1463.68s)]
*  And yes, you got banged up and scratched up or whatever, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1465.68s)]
*  but Trump cut the trees down, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1467.68s)]
*  and when you look around, we're all here. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1469.68s)]
*  And I'm like, that's not better. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1471.68s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1473.68s)]
*  That's a great analogy. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1475.68s)]
*  Also, during the game, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1477.68s)]
*  there was a pick six. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1479.68s)]
*  Yes, there was, Kat. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1481.68s)]
*  It was the first time that I saw one and I knew what it was. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1483.68s)]
*  Good for you, Kat. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1485.68s)]
*  But, you know, just advice to Taylor, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1487.68s)]
*  shake it off. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1489.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1491.68s)]
*  Hey, Kat, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1493.68s)]
*  did you ever think growing up [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1495.68s)]
*  that Flavor Flav would one day [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1497.68s)]
*  inquire about your pregnancy? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1499.68s)]
*  I'd always hoped. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1501.68s)]
*  I think if it would have been, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1503.68s)]
*  if I were reported back, Dennis Rodman asked about the baby, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1505.68s)]
*  then it would have been probably the baby. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1507.68s)]
*  I would have faked it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1509.68s)]
*  I would have faked it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1511.68s)]
*  The baby would have come out and I would have faked it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1513.68s)]
*  All right, we must move on. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1515.68s)]
*  Up next, a guard did his job keeping out a lefty mob. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F-b-FrMKi8&t=1517.68s)]
