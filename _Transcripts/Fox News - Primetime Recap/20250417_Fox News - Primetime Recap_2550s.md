# Fox News Highlights - April 16th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4)
*  Fake messaging, failed strategy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2.0s)]
*  Every American hearing Democrats prattle on about how illegal immigrants are cherished [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=4.0s)]
*  members of our community and about how we have to do more to protect their rights, they [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=14.08s)]
*  need to watch the remarks of the mother of Rachel Moran, who came to the White House [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=20.06s)]
*  briefing room today to share what happened to her 37-year-old daughter at the hands of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=25.9s)]
*  an illegal alien from El Salvador. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=31.02s)]
*  There's a six-inch square in the back of her head where the skull is shattered the way [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  that you would crush an eggshell in pieces. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=40.22s)]
*  Three-fourths of her brain hemorrhaged. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=44.82s)]
*  Her right and left side of her face bashed in. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=48.3s)]
*  Her beautiful face bashed in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=52.04s)]
*  Her head bashed in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  Broken bones fractured. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=58.08s)]
*  He takes and he drags her some more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=60.68s)]
*  There wasn't one inch of her body that didn't have some kind of injury. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=63.76s)]
*  She had a fractured rib, fractured nose, fractured skull. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=67.92s)]
*  And then he takes her into the tunnel and he picks her up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=75.32s)]
*  He throws her against the wall. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=80.52s)]
*  Blood is gushing from her head. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=83.56s)]
*  Her hair is soaked in blood. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  And they showed us pictures of her body. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=88.4s)]
*  Against the wall, outline, the blood outlined her body. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=92.28s)]
*  And you could see where the blood ran down around her as he was reaping her. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=95.92s)]
*  If you weren't moved by that, and all of you who are parents or grandparents out there, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=105.76s)]
*  imagine that pain. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=113.28s)]
*  Over the past, what, 20 years or so, we've had a heated debate in this country about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=117.28s)]
*  immigration, both legal and illegal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  And the question really has been, should the government, our government, focus on helping [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=125.8s)]
*  Americans struggling in a globalized economy and helping keep them safe? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=130.74s)]
*  Or should it do more to cater to the open borders radicals and the ultra wealthy who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=134.92s)]
*  think we can never have enough migrant labor? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Americans in the last election chose Trump's path, America first, with a real deportation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=145.28s)]
*  force. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=150.88s)]
*  But the Democrats, they're digging their heels in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=152.12s)]
*  Remember, once upon a time, they actually believed in borders. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  But now? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=157.56s)]
*  Well, they're doing everything in their power to keep as many illegals here as possible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=158.56s)]
*  And we're seeing their grand strategy play out, one that they hope will turn one of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  most powerful issues for Trump, which is immigration, against both him and his party. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=169.04s)]
*  Now, this left-wing effort is well organized and it's well funded. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=175.08s)]
*  And it's carried out by a myriad Democrat officials and their allies across politics, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=179.88s)]
*  nonprofits, law firms, and yes, the media. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=185.2s)]
*  First, it starts with the narrative building, the storytelling, the messaging. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=189.2s)]
*  Now the backdrop here is that Trump literally told voters he was going to deport as many [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=195.52s)]
*  illegals as possible. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=199.96s)]
*  And he won on that platform. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=201.76s)]
*  But now everything his administration does to fulfill that promise gets the most damning [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=204.8s)]
*  spin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=210.4s)]
*  Remember, illegals are never simply taken into custody. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=211.4s)]
*  He was effectively disappeared to a foreign country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=216.84s)]
*  A man who's charged with no crime, convicted of no crime, and who was illegally abducted. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=220.12s)]
*  U.S. citizens and immigrants alike are being disappeared off the street by men in vans [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  with no uniform. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=232.52s)]
*  ICE personnel are never enforcement officials carrying out lawful deportation orders. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=236.04s)]
*  It's almost Gestapo-like when you see folks coming up in masks and just grabbing people [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=243.0s)]
*  off the streets and throwing them in a van. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=248.6s)]
*  These Gestapo tactics aren't happening in a foreign country, not in a bygone era. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=250.72s)]
*  They're happening right here in the United States today. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  And of course, and of course, dictators being dictators, they don't care about creating [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=259.88s)]
*  a national crisis. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Right now, Donald Trump is defying a unanimous order by the Supreme Court to bring Kilmer [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=268.44s)]
*  back home. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=274.56s)]
*  I think that in of itself is a constitutional crisis. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=275.56s)]
*  We're approaching the point where the judge, if he wants to move forward with this contempt, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=279.36s)]
*  is going to have a hard time even enforcing it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=285.32s)]
*  It makes for a real crisis. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=287.76s)]
*  Is a constitutional crisis because the administration is under a court order to return this wrongfully [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=290.76s)]
*  deported man. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=297.4s)]
*  This wrongfully deported man. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=301.12s)]
*  Now this is all part of the messaging to program, it's real programming a dutiful press. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  And then of course to affect public opinion and move the polls so that eventually they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=309.8s)]
*  can reopen the border and then we can get the massive flow of humanity into the United [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  States going again. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=321.0s)]
*  That is their ultimate goal here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=322.8s)]
*  But remember, none of this narrative building, none of it would be possible without an array [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=324.6s)]
*  of well-funded lawyers and nonprofit allies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=330.92s)]
*  And they raise millions and I'm talking tens of millions of dollars from open border zealots [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=335.12s)]
*  and others dependent on illegal labor. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=340.12s)]
*  These organizations include groups like United We Dream, Immigrant Legal Resource Center [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=343.5s)]
*  and the National Immigration Project. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=349.76s)]
*  And they're ready to rush to any camera or any court to help illegals get benefits, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=352.64s)]
*  protection from deportation and even to file plaintiffs actions if you can believe it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=358.04s)]
*  The group CASA and CASA Legal, that's one of the biggest and most active pro illegal [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=364.04s)]
*  immigrant groups out there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=370.44s)]
*  Their website outlines its mission this way. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=372.48s)]
*  We will organize, organize, organize and resist. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=375.28s)]
*  We will stand united in fighting against the harmful policies that threaten to burden working [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=380.4s)]
*  families for the next four years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  They raised more than 21 million dollars last year alone, 63 percent from foundations and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  believe it or not, from government grants. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I looked at their financials. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=401.32s)]
*  And by the way, that money goes to pay the salary of lawyers like this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=404.92s)]
*  The government has made all sorts of wild allegations about Kilmer being a member of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=409.8s)]
*  MS 13. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=414.0s)]
*  There has been not a single piece of evidence that has been filed in court. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=416.36s)]
*  And oh yeah, well we're going to get into that in a moment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=420.28s)]
*  And along with the well choreographed messaging and the assistance from Big Legal, the immigration [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=425.44s)]
*  crusaders also create the veneer of popular support through rallies and online petitions. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=430.56s)]
*  And they're about as organic as using Roundup on your weeds. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  A father, a son, a brother who has dedicated himself to make our families American dream [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  reality. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=451.88s)]
*  OK, well we know what she really thinks because a few years back the wife of that individual [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=453.92s)]
*  was actually petitioning the court for a protective order. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=464.48s)]
*  She's kind of changed her mind on that now, saying she was a victim of domestic abuse [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=468.2s)]
*  and she just wanted to be on the safe side. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=471.64s)]
*  But look, these people aren't just, what you have to understand about this, they're [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=474.6s)]
*  not just arguing for this individual to be returned to the United States. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=478.0s)]
*  They're arguing for benefits. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=483.92s)]
*  They're arguing for in-state tuition. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=485.96s)]
*  They're arguing for all sorts of benefits and other things that American citizens get. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  That's what all these groups end up doing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=497.64s)]
*  And when they do that, the goal is what? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=499.56s)]
*  To convince you that illegal aliens are just the same as American citizens. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=503.12s)]
*  They deserve all the rights. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=507.34s)]
*  Look, they want them to vote. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=508.34s)]
*  But back to the media. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Most of the press hasn't dwelled on the inconvenient facts here, whether it's that the wife of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=513.8s)]
*  this individual actually essentially was accusing him of perhaps domestic abuse or that MS-13 [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=521.32s)]
*  was obviously the individual in El Salvador was a member of. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=529.24s)]

*  narrative. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=538.8s)]
*  So the process of setting this all up as a national concern has three steps. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=540.3s)]
*  And the groups involved are the usual suspects. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=546.72s)]

*  aliens to stay here permanently. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=571.12s)]
*  That is the truth. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  And that is the angle. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=576.72s)]
*  There's been an attempted prison break. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=581.16s)]
*  A Democrat senator arrived at a mega prison in El Salvador ready to free a Maryland dad. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=586.76s)]
*  But we're just finding out he's not really a Maryland dad. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=592.52s)]
*  Homeland Security says he's a verified member of MS-13 and he's been accused of beating [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=595.64s)]
*  his wife twice. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=600.68s)]
*  Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen was up at the crack of dawn to rescue this guy from [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=603.48s)]

*  I just landed at the airport in San Salvador a little while ago. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=629.0s)]

*  Embassy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=637.84s)]
*  The goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release of Kilmar Albrego Garcia. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  I also hope to have the chance to meet with him. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=646.0s)]
*  Once Van Hollen caravan down to the mega prison, he made an announcement. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  He's not leaving until he frees MS-13. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=653.32s)]
*  Why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CCOT? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  Why not release Albrego Garcia today? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=661.72s)]
*  I'm not asking him to smuggle Mr. Albrego Garcia in the United States. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=665.28s)]
*  I'm simply asking him to open the door of CCOT and let this innocent man walk out. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=669.48s)]
*  The distinguished senator from Maryland flew 3,000 miles on a rescue mission to free an [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  illegal alien gangbanger from a mega prison and bring him home to Maryland, even though [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=681.6s)]
*  his home is in El Salvador. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=687.52s)]
*  And the president of El Salvador said, would you like a tour of the mega prison instead? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=689.64s)]
*  I'm not interested at this moment in taking a tour of CCOT. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=695.12s)]
*  I just want to meet with Mr. Albrego Garcia. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=699.68s)]
*  He said he was not able to make that happen. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  I asked him if I came back next week, whether I'd be able to see Mr. Albrego Garcia. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  He said he couldn't promise that either. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=709.36s)]
*  So I asked him if I could get on the phone, either a video phone or just a phone, and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=712.36s)]
*  talk to Mr. Albrego Garcia. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  He said he could not arrange that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=720.64s)]
*  The president of El Salvador just told a U.S. senator, don't waste my time, gringo. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=722.16s)]
*  Van Hollen's flying to foreign countries to call illegal aliens, but he never called the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=726.7199999999999s)]

*  in the same gang? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=742.68s)]
*  Rachel Moran's mom was at today's White House press briefing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=745.48s)]

*  I don't understand this. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=792.16s)]
*  Van Hollen never spoke to Rachel Moran's mom, his own constituent, but Trump has, and he [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=794.6s)]

*  But the wife never followed up and appeared at the hearing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1044.52s)]
*  The next year in 2021, she accused him of domestic violence again and a judge issued [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1047.52s)]
*  a second protective order. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  This is what she told authorities. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1055.78s)]
*  He punched, scratched me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1057.76s)]
*  He ripped my shorts and shirt off. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1061.7s)]
*  He grabbed me by my arm. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1063.6s)]
*  I was afraid to be close to him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1065.24s)]
*  I have multiple photos, videos of how violent he could be and all the bruises he left me. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1067.24s)]
*  But again, she didn't appear at a follow-up hearing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1075.4s)]
*  This is the man who Democrats are defending. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  The court ordered that the respondent committed the following acts of abuse. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1082.5400000000002s)]
*  Once in May of 2021, assaults in any degree. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1087.68s)]
*  And on May 4th of 2021, he punched and scratched his wife, ripped off her shirt and grabbed [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1092.48s)]
*  and bruised her. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1100.48s)]
*  This is from a court in Maryland. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1102.32s)]
*  So not only are Democrats rushing to defend an illegal criminal foreign terrorist gang [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1106.02s)]
*  member, but also an apparent woman beater. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1110.04s)]
*  After being arrested with drugs, cash and gang attire during a gang sweep of known gang [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1113.72s)]
*  members as a part of a murder investigation and being questioned in relation to drug and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1118.02s)]
*  human trafficking and being accused of domestic violence twice with video evidence, Democrats [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  have made Kilmar Garcia their handpicked poster child, an innocent victim of Trump's [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1129.48s)]
*  mass deportations. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1134.32s)]
*  They couldn't have picked the worst guy if they tried. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1136.46s)]
*  This is the Maryland dad, a Maryland senator, flew to El Salvador to rescue from prison. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1139.16s)]
*  When Donald Trump was sworn into office, he designated MS-13 a terrorist organization. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1145.04s)]
*  And terrorists aren't bound by deportation restrictions, meaning the judge's restrictions [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1150.32s)]
*  on deporting Garcia to his home country of El Salvador vacated. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1155.16s)]
*  So ICE picked Garcia up, put him on a plane and sent him home. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1159.7s)]
*  Garcia's lawyers are arguing the Trump administration should have reopened his immigration case [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1164.52s)]
*  in Maryland, petition the judge to lift the El Salvador restriction order, which the judge [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1168.6000000000001s)]
*  would have done because he's now a designated terrorist, and then fly him back to El Salvador. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1173.28s)]
*  They're arguing over clerical issues, paperwork. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1179.74s)]
*  The Trump administration is arguing this is a national security situation. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1185.08s)]
*  If every MS-13 member goes through their own hearing, we'll never get these guys out of [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1189.1999999999998s)]
*  here. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1194.96s)]
*  That's the argument. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1196.04s)]
*  This is just common sense. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1197.56s)]
*  Pick them up and send them home. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1199.34s)]
*  Allow me to introduce you to the new face of hypocrisy, hysteria, feigned moral outrage [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1201.08s)]
*  inside the Democratic party. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1207.0s)]
*  That would be Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1209.06s)]
*  When Joe Biden allowed an estimated 12-plus million unvetted illegal immigrants to pour [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1212.3999999999999s)]

*  Van Hollen did nothing and he said nothing. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  When Maryland mother of five, Rachel Moran, was raped brutally, murdered brutally by an [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1226.8s)]
*  illegal immigrant from El Salvador on a Maryland hiking trail, Van Hollen could only be bothered [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  to release a short written statement to a news outlet. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  When 20-year-old Maryland woman, Kayla Hamilton, was raped and murdered in her own Maryland [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1242.3999999999999s)]
*  home by another illegal immigrant from El Salvador, Chris Van Hollen expressed zero [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1247.36s)]
*  public outrage. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1252.76s)]
*  But now that a citizen from El Salvador, not Maryland, who entered our country illegally [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1254.4799999999998s)]
*  and was accused of assaulting his own wife and accused of our own federal government [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1260.36s)]
*  under two administrations of violent gang activity, now that this illegal immigrant [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1265.32s)]
*  has been deported back to his home, all of a sudden Chris Van Hollen is all up in arms. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1271.48s)]
*  He has found his voice. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1277.72s)]
*  He is outraged. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1279.12s)]
*  In the past 48 hours, Van Hollen has rushed in front of every microphone, every camera [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1280.76s)]
*  he could find, giving one impassioned plea after another, vowing to rescue and bring [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1285.3999999999999s)]
*  back to America this illegal immigrant that got deported. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1291.16s)]
*  And today, Chris Van Hollen flew to El Salvador for the dumbest, most pointless political [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1295.96s)]
*  stunt in recent history. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1301.14s)]
*  We'll let you decide. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1302.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1304.24s)]
*  I'm here at the airport. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1305.24s)]
*  I'm about to board my flight for San Salvador. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1306.72s)]
*  The goal of this mission is to let the Trump administration, to let the government of El [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1309.88s)]
*  Salvador know that we are going to keep fighting to bring Abrego Garcia home. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1315.72s)]
*  I just landed at the airport in San Salvador a little while ago. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1321.24s)]
*  As I've said before, the goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1324.52s)]
*  of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1330.32s)]
*  And I won't stop trying. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1333.08s)]
*  And I can assure the president, the vice president that I may be the first United States senator [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1334.98s)]
*  to visit El Salvador on this issue. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1341.6799999999998s)]
*  But there will be more and there will be more members of Congress coming. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1344.84s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1348.7199999999998s)]
*  But by the way, if he does, if he is successful, maybe he can invite him to live with him. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1349.7199999999998s)]
*  It's no surprise Van Hollen left empty handed. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1353.9599999999998s)]
*  He couldn't even get a phone call with this illegal immigrant, much less secure his release [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1356.84s)]
*  from an El Salvador jail. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1361.1999999999998s)]
*  But Chris Van Hollen is still vowing to quote, bring him home. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1363.76s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1367.0s)]
*  Now, Chris, he is, he is home. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1368.0s)]
*  He is not a Maryland man like you and every other Democrat and everyone in the state run [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1371.06s)]
*  legacy media mob is claiming. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1375.7s)]
*  He's not an American. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1378.1s)]
*  He's not your constituent. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1379.7s)]
*  He was not in our country legally, according to a report, John Solomon. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1381.54s)]
*  He even admitted to police that he entered our country illegally. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1386.8999999999999s)]
*  In other words, you're a lawmaker, right? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1391.02s)]
*  Didn't follow our laws, didn't respect our borders or our sovereignty. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1393.98s)]
*  He had no right to be here. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  And you know who should still be here safe and sound in your state of Maryland? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1400.04s)]
*  That would be Kayla Hamilton and Rachel Morin. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1406.32s)]
*  But you didn't lift a finger for Rachel or a family or anyone in your state or anyone [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1409.1399999999999s)]
*  in this country to protect them from the likes of those illegals that murdered them or involved [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1413.76s)]
*  with them. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1419.6599999999999s)]
*  And Chris Van Hollen, well, couldn't be bothered with their safety and security. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1420.6599999999999s)]
*  To be honest, he's barely said anything at all about these two victims of illegal immigration. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  He might not even know who they are. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1429.8s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen is a disgrace to the entire state of Maryland, frankly to the entire country. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1431.44s)]
*  You know, this this performative art is just a joke. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1437.56s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1441.36s)]
*  He's grandstanding. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1442.36s)]
*  It's frankly repulsive. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1443.36s)]
*  He should be ashamed of himself. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1444.36s)]
*  Better yet, maybe he should take some time and listen to Rachel Morin's mother and reevaluate [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1446.72s)]
*  his entire political career. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1452.16s)]
*  Here's what she said on our show last night. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1454.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1456.44s)]
*  Did you ever get a call from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Alejandro Mayorkas or your [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1457.98s)]
*  senator, Van Hollen, who made a big deal about he's going to go to El Salvador and and bring [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1466.26s)]
*  home this one illegal from El Salvador, who Democrats are saying had no business being [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1473.98s)]
*  sent back to his home country. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1481.46s)]
*  Did they ever call you? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1483.18s)]
*  What are your thoughts on your senator going to bat for this illegal? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1485.0800000000002s)]
*  But did he ever say anything to you and your family about your loss to ever call you, ever [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1492.24s)]
*  take the time to be with you? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1496.6000000000001s)]
*  No, actually, I'm very angry. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1499.0s)]
*  I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1502.96s)]
*  He did not call our family. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1510.16s)]
*  He did not give condolences. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  There was no action on the Democratic Party in any way from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1514.82s)]
*  Mayorkas, anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators did anything to help search for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1522.9s)]
*  the murderer of my daughter. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1531.42s)]
*  Now in case the senator did miss our show, only hours ago, Patty Morin had this to say [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1534.3s)]
*  at the White House briefing with Caroline Levitt, and Caroline will also join us later [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1540.68s)]
*  in the show. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1545.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1546.28s)]
*  Why are we not protecting the American citizens? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1547.28s)]
*  It's just common sense. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1552.64s)]
*  Why are we not protecting our children? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1553.92s)]
*  And to have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge or barely acknowledged my [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1557.72s)]
*  daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1565.56s)]
*  and now a grandbaby without a grandmother so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1574.82s)]

*  Why does that person have more right than I do? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1589.86s)]
*  Or my daughter? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1596.06s)]
*  Or my grandchildren? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1597.06s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1600.6999999999998s)]
*  I've said it before, I will say it again, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayorkas, and everybody [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1603.26s)]
*  that stood by silently and didn't lift a finger to secure our border, as far as I'm concerned, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1607.8999999999999s)]
*  they all have blood on their hands. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1613.78s)]
*  By the way, they did not have the courage to even call these families, Lake and Riley's [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1615.6s)]
*  family, they didn't have the courage to call Jocelyn Ungary's family, or in this case, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1621.4s)]
*  Rachel Moran's mother. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1627.92s)]
*  Why not? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1629.68s)]
*  And why didn't they speak out about Biden's open borders? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1630.84s)]
*  Why didn't they seem to have even the slightest interest in honoring Rachel Moran or any of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1633.48s)]
*  the other victims of illegal immigration? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1638.72s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen needs to sit down or shut up, or maybe he could just stay in El Salvador. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1641.72s)]
*  To be honest, Van Hollen should be thanking President Trump for doing something he himself [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1647.16s)]

*  Okay, good. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1672.68s)]
*  An audience with hands. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1674.3600000000001s)]

*  In Chicago last night, former President Biden gave his first speech since leaving office. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1682.68s)]
*  As a result, millions of Americans now believe in life after death. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  He was speaking to a group of advocates for the disabled who were surprised to learn the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1693.64s)]
*  keynote speaker was one of their clients. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1697.68s)]
*  During his speech, he referred to black children as colored kids, which I heard was an improvement [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1701.68s)]
*  over his first draft. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1708.48s)]
*  You know, but it was nice after the speech he was greeted by a throng of well-wishers. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1713.68s)]
*  According to a new poll, California voters are not excited about Kamala Harris running [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1721.68s)]

*  Looks familiar, huh, Joe? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1757.54s)]
*  The UK's top court ruled that so-called trans women do not fit the legal definition of woman. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1760.54s)]

*  At least they can pass. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1773.54s)]

*  Funny, isn't this exactly the thing she tried to prosecute Trump for? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1783.54s)]
*  Makes me wonder, what if she banged Stormy Daniels? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1788.54s)]
*  On one loan, Letitia reportedly listed her father as her husband. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1796.54s)]
*  Hey, ladies, stay in your lane, said one woman. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1802.54s)]
*  Finally, California is proposing a new bill that allows homeless college kids to sleep [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1805.54s)]
*  in their cars on campus. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1815.54s)]

*  Homeless Dawn. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1822.54s)]
*  Alright, so apparently this entire week has been about one guy. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1824.54s)]
*  You know, the Maryland dad, with three kids, who also happens to be an illegal, likely [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1827.54s)]
*  a gang member and perhaps a domestic abuser. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1834.54s)]
*  His name, don't know, don't care. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1836.54s)]
*  Alright, I got a family, a new baby, a dog, a job, a neighborhood plagued by violent creeps. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1839.54s)]
*  I don't need this. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1845.54s)]
*  Here's what I do know, he's here illegally, and like Joe Biden, after a three bean burrito, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1847.54s)]
*  he has to go. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1851.54s)]
*  But faced with an adult solution to a real problem, the media yet again creates an imaginary [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1853.54s)]
*  concern. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1864.54s)]
*  From the same playbook that they always use, you worry about voter fraud, they say voter [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1865.54s)]
*  ID is racist. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1870.54s)]
*  You worry about government fraud and abuse, they claim Doge is cutting Social Security. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1871.54s)]
*  You worry about crime, they claim all cops are racist. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1875.54s)]
*  You worry about medical monsters experimenting on children, they claim trans kids are killing [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1878.54s)]
*  themselves. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1882.54s)]
*  Once you see this script, you can't unsee it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1883.54s)]
*  When we try to solve a real problem, they create the imaginary concern to manipulate [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1886.54s)]
*  public opinion. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1890.54s)]
*  But this time it's not working. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1892.54s)]
*  Overwhelmingly, the American public favor deportations of illegals, no matter what bull [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1894.54s)]
*  you conjure up. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1899.54s)]
*  So kids are not, he's illegal, he goes. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1901.54s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1904.54s)]
*  Let's go all the way back to a few months ago. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1905.54s)]
*  Remember those migrants coming in by the millions? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1910.54s)]
*  Migrants who we had no intel on, who we didn't vet, didn't investigate, who we identified [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1912.54s)]
*  only enough to write checks to? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1918.54s)]
*  We knew less about those young men than the ones I meet at truck stops. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1920.54s)]
*  Planes arriving in the middle of the night. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1926.54s)]
*  New programs created by executive order, supposedly by a guy who couldn't find his way off the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1928.54s)]
*  stage without a zip line. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1934.54s)]
*  And all it took to get refugee status was saying, I hate tortillas. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1937.54s)]
*  But now it's time for them to leave? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1943.54s)]
*  Suddenly we're all social workers. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1945.54s)]
*  Oh, he has kids, he works so hard. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1947.54s)]
*  Well, pal, maybe don't pick a country you're illegally in to start a family. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1950.54s)]
*  It sounds harsh, not when it's compared to the arrogant indifference of Democrats when [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1954.54s)]
*  women got raped and murdered by illegals that they let in. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1959.54s)]
*  Not to mention the relentless violence in cities they ignored for years because it was [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1963.54s)]
*  under their watch. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1967.54s)]
*  And now a couple of Democrat congressmen say they want to fly to El Salvador to retrieve [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1969.54s)]
*  this scum, who is an El Salvador citizen, by the way, not an American one. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1973.54s)]
*  Cory Booker wants to visit the prisoners in El Salvador. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1978.54s)]
*  And that makes sense, it's the only place where people can't get up and leave when he [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1982.54s)]
*  starts yapping. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1985.54s)]
*  But do the Dems realize they have no authority in El Salvador? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1987.54s)]
*  El Salvador is a little different than the green room at the View. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1992.54s)]
*  For one, the tattoos on the View were branded by farmers. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=1998.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2004.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2005.54s)]
*  They're used to it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2006.54s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2008.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2009.54s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2010.54s)]
*  But really, the Maryland Dems are the ones who are used to it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2011.54s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2014.54s)]
*  But really, the Maryland Dad is just the latest awful prop for the latest awful narrative, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2015.54s)]
*  a diversion to make you forget what the Biden regime chose to import with the media cheering [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2021.54s)]
*  them on. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2026.54s)]
*  The crime, the fentanyl, the overwhelmed schools, the raped and murdered women. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2027.54s)]
*  Joe did a killer job, and by that, I mean he actually got people killed. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2032.54s)]
*  The media wants us crying over this dude? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2036.54s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2039.54s)]
*  I'm saving my outrage for the Americans that Biden, Harris, and Mayorkas burdened, hurt, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2040.54s)]
*  and betrayed. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2045.54s)]
*  And yet the press is losing it like someone just said Brian Stelter farted. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2046.54s)]
*  The mainstream media has run more stories on this jackass than they did on the victims [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2053.54s)]
*  of the crime wave created by the open border they created. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2058.54s)]
*  Look, it's simple. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2062.54s)]
*  Deportation is the corrective to importation. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2064.54s)]
*  When they came in, our terrible leaders didn't ask questions. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2066.54s)]
*  Instead, they cared more about border agents getting whipped or whipping migrants. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2070.54s)]
*  So now when it's time to go, I'm not wasting mental shelf space on their concerns. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2075.54s)]
*  Oh, but we're not sure he's MS-13. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2080.54s)]
*  That sounds like a lot of the guys Kat used to date. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2083.54s)]
*  But I repeat, I don't care. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2090.54s)]
*  And don't get me started on, but isn't there a process? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2094.54s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2097.54s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2098.54s)]
*  It's called hit the f***ing road. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2099.54s)]
*  You can argue the legal s*** all you want. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2107.54s)]
*  Have at it, Clarence Darrow. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2110.54s)]
*  Whatever his name is. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2112.54s)]
*  But all of that is downstream from the initial massive injustice. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2114.54s)]
*  A Democrat government that deliberately flooded the country with illegals. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2118.54s)]
*  If they didn't create this mess, we wouldn't have to clean it up. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2122.54s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2125.54s)]
*  If you want to argue the legal implications, call 1-800-I-don't-give-a-f***. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2127.54s)]
*  Let's welcome Ted Excav! [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2133.54s)]
*  When he calls the suicide hotline, they let it go to voicemail comedian Joe Mackey. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2138.54s)]
*  He punctures left-wing fibs and runs circles around libs. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2147.54s)]
*  Former Trump advisor Steve Cortez. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2151.54s)]
*  She's got it all. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2155.54s)]
*  Looks, brains, and both kidneys. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2157.54s)]
*  The Federalist correspondent, Breonna Lyman. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2159.54s)]
*  And like shuffleboard, women love to do him on cruise ships. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2164.54s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian, and former NWU world champion, Tyrus. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2169.54s)]
*  Joe, you look great. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2173.54s)]
*  You look like the hip reverend at a school for wayward kids. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2174.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2181.54s)]
*  Are you on your cover tonight? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2182.54s)]
*  No, Greg. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2184.54s)]
*  I have a meeting on a yacht. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2185.54s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2187.54s)]
*  I will say due process is important. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2189.54s)]
*  But it's also important for the plaintiffs. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2192.54s)]
*  Now, here's a person that sort of has a lot of experience with the plaintiffs. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2195.54s)]
*  Now, here's a person that came to the country in 2011, spent 14 years and multiple children later. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2200.54s)]
*  He's still here. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2208.54s)]
*  It just reminds me of college. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2210.54s)]
*  But I'll say this. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2212.54s)]
*  Look, Trump did screw up here. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2215.54s)]
*  They deported him to the one country he couldn't be deported to. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2218.54s)]
*  They should send him somewhere worse like France. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2222.54s)]
*  But whenever you make a mistake, no matter how minor, you should try to fix it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2225.54s)]
*  Like one time I damaged my brother's car, but I made sure that my dad paid for it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2230.54s)]
*  Well done, Joe. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2238.54s)]
*  A lot of lessons in that response. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2239.54s)]
*  Steve, I have a real problem with the concern over one illegal alien somehow taking preference over the indifference that they shared for actual sex. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2244.54s)]
*  That they shared for actual citizens. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2254.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2256.54s)]
*  Can I ask you first, though, from your monologue, who hates tortillas? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2257.54s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2261.54s)]
*  I mean, as the lone Latino here, the token Latino, you know, for the ensemble. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2262.54s)]
*  But you know, that was how easy it was to claim asylum. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2266.54s)]
*  Of course, right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2269.54s)]
*  Any ridiculous lie coached by American NGOs. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2270.54s)]
*  Look, this guy is an absolute scumbag, right? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2273.54s)]
*  And we know that because he beats women. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2276.54s)]
*  If you beat women, you're a scumbag. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2278.54s)]
*  But here's the point, too, Greg. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2279.54s)]
*  It wouldn't matter if he were a wonderful person. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2281.54s)]
*  He still trespassed. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2283.54s)]
*  He still broke and entered into our homeland and was here illegally. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2284.54s)]
*  So I don't care if he was Ward Cleaver, if he was that good of a husband and father. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2288.54s)]
*  He has to go. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2292.54s)]
*  Do we remember Ward Cleaver, right? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2294.54s)]
*  That's for all of our viewers over 90. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2297.54s)]
*  The great late Hugh Beaumont. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2302.54s)]
*  It's sad that I know that name. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2305.54s)]
*  He was a great dad, though. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2308.54s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2310.54s)]
*  He really was. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2311.54s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2312.54s)]
*  I have no idea who these people are. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2313.54s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2317.54s)]
*  If it wasn't on Good Times, I didn't watch either. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2318.54s)]
*  Why is it that when the Democrats are presented two choices, they always pick the wrong one? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2322.54s)]
*  They always side with the bad guy and then try to convince everybody, no, actually, they're misunderstood. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2328.54s)]
*  Why don't you just go with your gut and you go, like, I know this guy's bad? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2334.54s)]
*  Because why would they have to? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2338.54s)]
*  They have the weight of the propaganda press behind them. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2339.54s)]
*  This guy's apparently a Maryland father. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2342.54s)]
*  You would never glean from these headlines that he was here legally, should have been deported in 2018, and apparently beat his wife. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2344.54s)]
*  But they do that on purpose. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2350.54s)]
*  They want to blur the line between this illegal alien and a citizen to delegitimize these efforts to get rid of all the illegal aliens. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2352.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing, though, that it's all because of Trump. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2358.54s)]
*  They have to pick the they'll always pick the worst person because at least it's not Trump. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2362.54s)]
*  I love Tyrus that this guy Van Halen, what's his name, Van Holland? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2367.54s)]
*  He's no Van Halen. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2372.54s)]
*  No, he said Hagar Van Halen. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2374.54s)]
*  Yes, he said. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2377.54s)]
*  I was going to say the guy from Extreme was in. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2378.54s)]
*  Even worse Van Halen. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2382.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2384.54s)]
*  Gary Chacon did an admirable job. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2385.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2388.54s)]
*  By the way, you're right. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2389.54s)]
*  Where was I? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2391.54s)]
*  Oh, that thing he flies out of. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2393.54s)]
*  He thinks he's doing like this amazing thing in the air. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2395.54s)]
*  All the news comes out this dude's a wife beater. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2398.54s)]
*  Cory Booker's like, thank God I didn't go. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2401.54s)]
*  I didn't drive to the airport yet. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2403.54s)]
*  You know, the funny part is, is that he's going to El Salvador to tell them that they're wrong. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2404.54s)]
*  And then you're going to have to call the White House to get your jailed ass home. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2414.54s)]
*  That ought to be a fun. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2418.54s)]
*  I would love to be like, let me answer the phones that night. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2420.54s)]
*  Hello? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2423.54s)]
*  Oh, I'll have to put you on hold. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2424.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2426.54s)]
*  That's the problem with dumb people. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2428.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2430.54s)]
*  No, no, seriously. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2431.54s)]
*  It's like they're dumb and we know they're dumb. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2432.54s)]
*  But the problem is they don't know they're dumb because they're dumb. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2435.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2439.54s)]
*  Well, by the way, speaking of that lack of intelligence, they're playing in Trump's lane here. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2440.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2448.54s)]
*  This issue by far is his strongest issue. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2449.54s)]
*  All the polling shows us that right. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2452.54s)]
*  It was the foundational pillar of his election last November. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2453.54s)]
*  Why do they continue to play in his lane? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2457.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2460.54s)]
*  Where he's strongest, which just shows you how it on. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2461.54s)]
*  Well, it goes back to, and I've been on this conspiracy thing about why they're so upset about Doge. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2462.54s)]
*  And I think this guy falls into it as we, the corruption for the last four years, there was some, there was a shadow group running the government. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2467.54s)]
*  There was a small percentage that kept picking things that didn't make sense to us. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2474.54s)]
*  There were 20% on everything because that's where the embezzlement comes from and the money comes from. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2477.54s)]
*  I think they're trying to make an example out of him. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2481.54s)]
*  So when it comes to them, when we see congressmen being arrested for embezzlement, they're going to say, oh, they're deporting us. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2484.54s)]
*  They're taking us like they did. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2490.54s)]
*  They're disappearing. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2491.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2492.54s)]
*  They're disappearing. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2493.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2494.54s)]
*  No, no, you got a warrant, bro. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2495.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2496.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2497.54s)]
*  But again, it goes back to my first point. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2498.54s)]
*  Dumb. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2500.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2501.54s)]
*  I do not, I resent the way the media is trying to force feed you their priorities. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2502.54s)]
*  It's not even their priority. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2509.54s)]
*  They don't care about this guy either, but they're, they're basically pushing this so hard on you to push all your other concerns out. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2510.54s)]
*  What about this guy? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2517.54s)]
*  Forget about the victims of crime. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2518.54s)]
*  Forget about the fact that downtown we had a young woman just knifed with a broken bottle. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2520.54s)]
*  That's not your concern. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2524.54s)]
*  It's this guy, this gang member. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2526.54s)]
*  And that drives me crazy. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2528.54s)]

*  Yes. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2531.54s)]
*  Again, dumb. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2532.54s)]
*  Gang banger lawyer. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2533.54s)]
*  That sounds like a great show. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7uG9Sbu4&t=2534.54s)]
