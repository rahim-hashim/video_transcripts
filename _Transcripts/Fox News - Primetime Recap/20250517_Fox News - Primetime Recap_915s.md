# Fox News Highlights - May 16th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E)
*  Comey's shell game. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=2.6s)]
*  Jim Comey is now and always has been a sanctimonious prig. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=4.54s)]
*  And now, he's a sanctimonious prig who's been questioned [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=12.64s)]
*  by the Secret Service over his threatening post against Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=16.16s)]
*  Two sources telling Fox late this afternoon [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=19.92s)]
*  that the disgraced former FBI director snuck [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=22.5s)]
*  in through a garage entrance [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=25.0s)]
*  to tell the Secret Service agents his side of the story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=27.08s)]
*  We're going to bring you more as we get it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=30.18s)]
*  But first, let's remind everyone who James Comey really is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=32.82s)]
*  As FBI director long before the George Floyd riots, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=37.58s)]
*  he was apologizing for law enforcement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=41.66s)]
*  He was doing the usual liberal guilt dance, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=45.0s)]
*  fueling a racial narrative that made him kind of more tolerable [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=48.5s)]
*  as a tolerable Republican when he spoke in 2015 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=52.36s)]
*  at Georgetown University. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=56.2s)]
*  Something happens to people in law enforcement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=58.06s)]
*  Many of us develop different flavors of cynicism [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  that we work hard to resist [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=65.34s)]
*  because they can be lazy mental shortcuts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=66.68s)]
*  For example, criminal suspects routinely lie about their guilt [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=69.78s)]
*  and nearly everybody that we charge is guilty. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, is guilty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=78.68s)]
*  But sometimes, look, the first instinct of the accused, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=80.72s)]
*  Jim, is to lie. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=84.12s)]
*  And that's precisely what he's doing now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=86.08s)]
*  After posting and deleting that photo on Instagram [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=88.22s)]
*  that's widely considered to be a threat [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=91.62s)]
*  against the President of the United States, 8647. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=93.26s)]
*  Now, Comey claims that he knew 47 was a reference to Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=97.76s)]
*  but didn't know what the numbers together signified [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=101.16s)]
*  and that once the threat of violence was raised, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=103.84s)]
*  well, he immediately deleted the post. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=106.44s)]
*  Well, no one with a brain is buying it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=108.64s)]
*  Trump certainly isn't. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=112.96s)]
*  He knew exactly what that meant. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=114.96s)]
*  A child knows what that meant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=116.84s)]
*  If you're the FBI director [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=121.08s)]
*  And it says it loud and clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=125.98s)]
*  Now, he wasn't very competent, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=128.98s)]
*  but he was competent enough to know what that meant. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=131.62s)]
*  And he did it for a reason. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=134.82s)]
*  He's calling for the assassination of the President. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=137.16s)]
*  Look, Trump's comments about Comey are right on the money. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=140.84s)]
*  Now, remember, we're talking about a guy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=143.98s)]
*  the former FBI director, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  who helped set the wheels in motion with Mike Flynn [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  all the way through the phony Russia collusion scandal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=152.68s)]
*  and then, of course, we can't forget early on, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=156.06s)]
*  his get-out-of-jail-free decision on Hillary. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=158.12s)]
*  Do you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=161.16s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=163.76s)]
*  You think it's possible? Yes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=165.6s)]
*  I don't know whether the current President of the United States [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=166.7s)]
*  with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=170.02s)]
*  It's possible. He could be wearing an ankle bracelet [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=173.58s)]
*  while accepting the nomination at the Republican convention. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=175.76s)]
*  You could have a president who is potentially incarcerated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=179.1s)]
*  when he's elected. Trump is the leader of a cult [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=183.14s)]
*  who has radicalized his followers, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=186.94s)]
*  and dealing with a radicalized populace [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=188.98s)]
*  is incredibly challenging. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=191.38s)]
*  That's a phenomenon we've seen in Islamic radicalism. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=192.88s)]
*  The man has been seething about Trump from day one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=196.98s)]
*  He greenlit the surveillance of the Trump campaign, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=201.98s)]
*  and he must have been fuming that Trump won in 2016. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=205.48s)]
*  Remember the curtain video when he tried to hide from Trump [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=209.98s)]
*  when he was actually in the White House? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=213.48s)]
*  I look, and right next to me is this blue curtain, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=215.98s)]
*  and I'm wearing a blue suit that doesn't match perfectly, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=218.48s)]
*  but close enough, so I'm thinking, how great is that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=220.48s)]
*  I got a little camouflage, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=223.48s)]
*  and so I start moving over, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=224.98s)]
*  and I pressed myself against the blue curtain, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=226.48s)]
*  thinking, this is my save. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=228.98s)]
*  This will save me from having this public embrace [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=230.98s)]
*  with the president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=233.48s)]
*  Then he was infuriated about being fired, of course, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=236.48s)]
*  and livid that the Mueller report was a dud. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=239.48s)]
*  And he probably hasn't slept [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=242.48s)]
*  since Biden's disastrous debate performance. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=244.98s)]
*  But Comey's playing with fire now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=248.48s)]
*  We already know that two people tried to kill President Trump [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=250.98s)]
*  with one actually hitting him at Butler. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=254.48s)]
*  And this was preceded by years of celebrities [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=256.98s)]
*  calling for violence against Trump, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=259.98s)]
*  normalizing what is now known as the assassination culture. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=262.98s)]
*  How dare he say the things he does? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=267.48s)]
*  Of course I want to punch him in the face. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=269.48s)]
*  Right, there you go. Yes! [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=270.98s)]
*  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=273.48s)]
*  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=276.98s)]
*  And it continued this week, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=283.48s)]
*  where it was darkness on the edge of clown [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=285.98s)]
*  with Bruce Springsteen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=288.48s)]
*  I'm going to go off script here for a moment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=308.48s)]
*  The America that Bruce Springsteen wrote about, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=310.48s)]
*  you know, the steel mills, the workers in Jersey, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=313.98s)]
*  hey dude, they all voted for Trump [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=317.48s)]
*  because he didn't sell them out, you did. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=319.48s)]
*  He should be on Trump's side [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=323.48s)]
*  if he really believed the lyrics he wrote. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=324.98s)]
*  But he abandoned those people long ago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=327.48s)]
*  Do people pay at concerts for a political lecture? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=330.48s)]
*  Years ago I wrote a book called Shut Up and Sing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=332.98s)]
*  10th Avenue frees him out. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=335.48s)]
*  But of course, elected officials, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=337.98s)]
*  people with real power, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=339.98s)]
*  they also fed the assassination culture. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=341.48s)]
*  This was happening just last month [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=344.48s)]
*  from the Senate minority leader. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=346.98s)]
*  He's acting like a king, a mob boss, a wannabe dictator. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=349.98s)]
*  He said he wanted to be a dictator on day one, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=353.98s)]
*  it looks like he's extending it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=355.98s)]
*  When the founders drafted our constitution, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=357.48s)]
*  they feared a man like Donald Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=359.48s)]
*  Well, if Trump's a dictator, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=361.98s)]
*  then you don't have too much to think about, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=363.98s)]
*  to think, well, it's noble then to take out the dictator, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=367.98s)]
*  They get that, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=371.98s)]
*  So actually calling Trump Hitler and a dictator, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=373.98s)]
*  it's always been a venal lie. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=376.98s)]
*  They always lie because they have nothing else. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=379.48s)]
*  But it was all made more credible to the untrained mind [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=383.48s)]
*  because of the one man crusade that Comey led against Trump, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=386.98s)]
*  again, going all the way back to 2015. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=390.98s)]
*  And as I said earlier, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=394.98s)]
*  the Secret Service reportedly interviewed Comey today [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=395.98s)]
*  about the shell game. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=397.98s)]
*  We're going to learn more about the potential charges [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=398.98s)]
*  in the days ahead. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=400.98s)]
*  But isn't it time that a person of prominence [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=401.98s)]
*  who should know better face some real consequences here [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=405.98s)]
*  before something real tragic happens? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=409.98s)]
*  At the very least, shouldn't the D.C. Bar Association [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=413.98s)]
*  have something to say about Jim Comey? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=415.98s)]
*  Is this what an officer of the court, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=418.98s)]
*  is how an officer of the court should act [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=420.98s)]
*  given the stakes for the country [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=423.98s)]
*  and the heels of two assassination attempts in one year? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=424.98s)]
*  Comey and company threw everything they had [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=429.98s)]
*  at Donald Trump four years. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=431.98s)]
*  They knew that he would expose their con [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=434.98s)]
*  if he were reelected. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=437.98s)]
*  And he did. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=439.98s)]
*  Literally a year ago. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=440.98s)]
*  And he talked about it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=442.98s)]
*  They thought they'd see him maybe barred from the presidency, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=443.98s)]
*  and they were sending around memes of him in an orange jumpsuit. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=447.98s)]
*  They thought it was really funny. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=450.98s)]
*  But in the end, Trump turned the tables on all of them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=452.98s)]
*  And they showed their true colors. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=455.98s)]
*  And voters saw that the Democrats [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=457.98s)]
*  are the true threats to democracy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=460.98s)]
*  Trump saved us, at least for four years, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=463.98s)]
*  from their venal reign of incompetence. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=467.98s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=470.98s)]
*  Fox News Alert. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=472.98s)]
*  A recording of Joe Biden's interview [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=473.98s)]
*  with special counsel Robert Herr has just been released. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=475.98s)]
*  Axios got its hands on about eight minutes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=478.98s)]
*  We'll play some of it for you in a second. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=481.98s)]
*  Robert Herr had been appointed special counsel [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=483.98s)]
*  by the Biden Justice Department [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=485.98s)]
*  to investigate Joe Biden's mishandling of classified documents [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=487.98s)]
*  during and after his vice presidency. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=490.98s)]
*  Classified documents were discovered in sloppily packed boxes [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=493.98s)]
*  in Joe Biden's garage next to his Corvette [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=496.98s)]
*  and inside his home office. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=499.98s)]
*  At the same time Biden was raiding Mar-a-Lago [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=501.98s)]
*  and indicting Trump for mishandling classified documents, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=504.98s)]
*  his handlers were scrambling to locate the classified documents [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=507.98s)]
*  that Biden had mishandled. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=511.98s)]
*  Now, Biden as VP didn't have the constitutional authority [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=513.98s)]
*  to possess any classified documents. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=517.98s)]
*  So after Robert Herr interviewed President Joe Biden, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=520.98s)]
*  he released a report. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=522.98s)]
*  The report stated that Joe Biden had mishandled classified documents, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=524.98s)]
*  but because he was a, quote, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=528.98s)]
*  sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=530.98s)]
*  he declined to recommend charges. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=534.98s)]
*  Later, the transcript of the Biden-Hur interview was released, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=537.98s)]
*  but not the audio. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=541.98s)]
*  Tonight, we have some of this audio. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=543.98s)]
*  First, we'll play you a portion where special counsel Robert Herr [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=545.98s)]
*  asks President Biden, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=548.98s)]
*  where did you keep your papers? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=550.98s)]
*  And Biden can't answer. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=552.98s)]
*  And then rambles incoherently about his son. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=554.98s)]
*  Can't remember when his son died [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=556.98s)]
*  and can't remember when Trump was elected. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=558.98s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=560.98s)]
*  I'm going to read you some documents related to the Penn-Biden Center [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=564.98s)]
*  or the Biden cancer program shot or your book. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=568.98s)]
*  Where did you keep papers that related to those things [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=574.98s)]
*  that you were actively working on? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=578.98s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=583.98s)]
*  This is what? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=591.98s)]
*  2017, 18, that area? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=593.98s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=596.98s)]
*  Remember, in this timeframe, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=598.98s)]
*  my son has either been deployed or is dying. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=602.98s)]
*  And so, if it was, and so I hadn't, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=607.98s)]
*  I hadn't at this point, even though I'm a Penn, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=618.98s)]
*  I hadn't walked away from the idea that I might run for office again. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=621.98s)]
*  If I ran again, I'd be running for president. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=625.98s)]
*  And so, what was happening though, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=628.98s)]
*  one month before dying, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=634.98s)]
*  May 30th, 30th, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=637.98s)]
*  2018. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=640.98s)]
*  2015, he died. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=642.98s)]
*  I think it was 2015. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=644.98s)]
*  I'm not sure the months are, but I think it was. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=646.98s)]
*  That's right, Mr. President. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=648.98s)]
*  And what's happened in the meantime is that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=650.98s)]
*  as Trump gets elected in November of 2017, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=658.98s)]
*  2016, 2016. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=667.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=669.98s)]
*  So, what, I have 2017. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=671.98s)]
*  That's when you left office, January of 2017. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=677.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=680.98s)]
*  But that's when Trump gets sworn in. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=684.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=687.98s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=688.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=689.98s)]
*  And in 2017, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=690.98s)]
*  Bo had passed and... [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=695.98s)]
*  Robert Herr was absolutely right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=699.98s)]
*  It's very hard not to feel sympathetic for President Biden. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=701.98s)]
*  He's clearly exhausted. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=704.98s)]
*  His memory's shot, and he's lost and confused about his very painful past. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=706.98s)]
*  Joe Biden and Robert Herr continued. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=710.98s)]
*  Bo, I used to go home on the train [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=713.98s)]
*  in the period [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=718.98s)]
*  that I was still in the Senate. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=725.98s)]
*  Anyway, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=730.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=733.98s)]
*  There was pressure, not pressure. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=738.98s)]
*  Bo knew how much I adored him. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=740.98s)]
*  And I understand, maybe it sounds so, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=746.98s)]
*  but everybody knew how close we were. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=754.98s)]
*  There was not anybody in the world who wondered whether or not. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=756.98s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=761.98s)]
*  And so... [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=764.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if it's too good to have to take a break. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=765.98s)]
*  No, I mean, just keep going. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=767.98s)]
*  You got it done. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=769.98s)]
*  Biden still hasn't answered the question four minutes later. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=771.98s)]
*  Still hasn't answered it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=773.98s)]
*  Where did you keep your papers? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=775.98s)]
*  Still has not answered it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=777.98s)]
*  If he can't answer a simple question like that in a high-stakes interview, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=779.98s)]
*  how was he in the Situation Room? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=782.98s)]
*  How bad was his memory? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=784.98s)]
*  What else wasn't he able to remember when he was president? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=786.98s)]
*  Remember, this is the first time an outsider had spent any time [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=789.98s)]
*  with the president for a very long time. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=793.98s)]
*  This was October 2023. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=796.98s)]
*  This is the third year of his presidency. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=798.98s)]
*  Remember, he had been kept from his cabinet secretaries, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=800.98s)]
*  went for months without seeing or speaking to them. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=803.98s)]
*  This was at a time when his inner circle was getting smaller and smaller. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=807.98s)]
*  And sometimes there'd be, like, four to five days [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=811.98s)]
*  when the public hadn't even laid eyes on him. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=814.98s)]
*  Her was the first one within the Biden administration [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=817.98s)]
*  to tell the truth and say, something's not right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=820.98s)]
*  And when his report was released, it was like a bomb went off. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=824.98s)]
*  Biden was forced to jump out of bed at 8 o'clock at night [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=827.98s)]
*  in a hastily arranged press conference, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=830.98s)]
*  where he lashed out at her and started pointing his fingers. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=833.98s)]
*  How bad is your memory, and can you continue [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=836.98s)]
*  to see him as president? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=840.98s)]
*  My memory is so bad, I can't let you speak. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=842.98s)]
*  For months when you were asked about your age, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=845.98s)]
*  you would respond with the words, watch me. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=847.98s)]
*  Many American people have been watching, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=849.98s)]
*  and they have expressed concerns about your age. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=852.98s)]
*  That is your judgment. That is your judgment. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=855.98s)]
*  That is not the judgment of the press. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=858.98s)]
*  Biden's performance did nothing to shut down the talk [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=860.98s)]
*  that he was too old to be president [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=863.98s)]
*  and too old to run for reelection. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=865.98s)]
*  But the dam never really broke. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=867.98s)]
*  Democrats were never able to force a primary [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=869.98s)]
*  or force him to step down. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=871.98s)]
*  And the next bomb to go off after her report, the debate. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=873.98s)]
*  We finally beat Medicare. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=877.98s)]
*  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=879.98s)]
*  He's right, he did beat Medicare. He beat it to death. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=882.98s)]
*  I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=885.98s)]
*  on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=888.98s)]
*  with more border patrol and more asylum officers. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=892.98s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=896.98s)]
*  I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=898.98s)]
*  I don't think he knows what he said either. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJpLf_tdR5E&t=900.98s)]
