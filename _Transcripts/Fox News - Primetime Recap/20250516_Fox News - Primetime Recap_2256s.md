# Fox News Highlights - May 15th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco)
*  And now, who says we can't? That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, forget James Comey for a moment. What an amazing week this has been. Look at [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  how they greeted Trump in Dubai tonight. The Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=13.52s)]
*  world, gives a salute to America. Now, personally, I love seeing all the pomp and circumstance [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=18.6s)]
*  for a real American president this week. Which country was the best host of the U.S. delegation, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=25.24s)]
*  do you think? You watched a lot of it. Well, it was like they were all trying to outdo [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=31.4s)]
*  one another. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=35.099999999999994s)]
*  America has never seen anything like this. For decades, we've been locked into fight [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=48.44s)]
*  mode, captive to stale strategies and dusty thinking. Americans were conditioned to believe [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=53.08s)]
*  that we couldn't show strength unless our military was firing missiles or we were dropping [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=58.8s)]
*  bombs somewhere. But Trump never bought any of this. He never bought that line. From day [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=63.8s)]
*  one, his attitude was, since this hasn't worked, why not try something different? His radical [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=69.72s)]
*  idea was let's make more friends, more money for our people, and we'll fight fewer wars. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=77.6s)]
*  Now, this simple concept has been at the core of this week's historic trip. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=84.92s)]
*  I don't think our friendship's ever been stronger than it is right now. And you will never see [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  anything like the relationship that we have. We just left Saudi Arabia, as you know, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=94.14s)]
*  you have fantastic crown prints. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  These weren't cluster bombs. These were love bombs. And they continue today in the UAE. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=102.6s)]
*  Trump was the first American president to visit there. So rather than insult them with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=107.72s)]
*  lectures, he took time and showed respect. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=113.08s)]
*  Well, I'd like to thank you, Your Highness. What a lot of people don't know, I think my [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  staff is very surprised by it. You and I have been friends for a long time. We've been good [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  friends. And what they don't know about you is that you are considered a truly great warrior. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=130.6s)]
*  This is how you do it. It's diplomacy, Trump style. And it often involves business, business [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=138.04s)]
*  that's mutually beneficial. And his involvement in corporate leaders, frankly, that was a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=144.24s)]
*  masterstroke. And it's paying dividends, first in Saudi Arabia, then in Qatar, and today [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=149.94s)]
*  in Abu Dhabi. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  A wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago, and he told us about your generous [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  statement as to the $1.4 trillion. And all I could say is thank you very much. We have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=165.6s)]
*  now I think substantially over $10 trillion of investment. And now when they add the $1.4 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  trillion, we easily break that number. We're having numbers that we've never done before. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  We are going to be your friend and we're going to be your partner. And we really appreciate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=187.12s)]
*  your confidence and investment. That's your biggest investment that you've ever made. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=191.24s)]
*  And we really appreciate it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=195.96s)]
*  What a concept. An American president as the promoter in chief of the United States. Unapologetically [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=198.78s)]
*  pro-American with a hand of friendship always extended. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=207.34s)]
*  I shook more hands than any human being is capable of doing. They were starving for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=211.12s)]
*  love. Because our country didn't give them love. They gave them a fist bump. Remember [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=218.12s)]
*  the fist bump in Saudi Arabia? He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia in that case and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=223.12s)]
*  he gives them a fist bump. That's not what they want. They don't want a fist bump. They [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=228.36s)]
*  want to shake his hand. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=232.12s)]
*  More than a fist bump. But wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought it was Biden. But he flew [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=234.44s)]
*  all around the world. He was the master at foreign affairs. After all, he was so inspiring. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  The message I want the world to hear today. America is back. America is back. Diplomacy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=245.48s)]
*  is back at the center of our foreign policy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=254.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. That didn't work out too well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=257.8s)]
*  Joe may have logged a lot of miles on government jets and met all the world leaders, but none [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=261.84s)]
*  of it, and I mean none of it, meant that Americans were any better off. Instead, a lot of us [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=268.0s)]
*  in America were embarrassed. And now, a new era with Trump 2.0. It's hard work, friendship [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=273.88s)]
*  and optimism. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=282.38s)]
*  This has been an amazing trip. We've raised trillions of dollars of investment for our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=284.04s)]
*  country. And we're dealing with really good people that have been abandoned in a way by [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=291.04s)]
*  the United States. And we're not going to abandon them. We have very good friends in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=296.04s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and in Qatar. They felt abandoned. They were going to be captured by China from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=300.32s)]
*  the same point of trade. And that's not going to happen anymore. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=306.88s)]
*  No it won't happen again. But only Trump and his team saw this. Remember, for years the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=310.8s)]
*  old dinosaurs of the D.C. foreign policy establishment, you know who they are, they dismissed, they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=316.8s)]
*  ridiculed his brash approach. They called out his supposed foreign policy naivete. But [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=323.16s)]
*  after this trip? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not in the habit of praising Donald Trump, but I got to tell you, I, the last week or [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  so in the Middle East, I think the president has in this last week or so played the Middle [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  East pretty darn well. I got to give him some kudos there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=339.72s)]
*  I don't know why Joe Biden didn't do this. I don't like Trump's motivations for lots [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=342.24s)]
*  of things he does. But he's, one thing you will say is he's not like tied to this like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=345.6s)]
*  constant fear, stupid, you know, blob type, you know, well, we don't do this. We must [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=351.08s)]
*  leverage the sanctions for blah, blah, blah. You know, no, sometimes you just have to try [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=357.24s)]
*  something different. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=361.64s)]
*  OK, liberals praising Trump. Then this headline, Biden officials impressed by Trump's Middle [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=363.08s)]
*  East visit, one saying, gosh, I wish I could work for an administration that could move [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=370.64s)]
*  so quickly. And the China box out also getting noticed in this piece, calling Trump's trip [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=374.96s)]
*  remarkable because of mega deals and because he's out foxing China. Again, that is 100 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  percent right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=387.12s)]
*  Think of all the idiotic headlines trashing Trump's approach to foreign affairs. He's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=389.0s)]
*  just like Putin. He's destroying our alliances. Total chaos. But, you know, through all of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  that, Trump just ignored the white noise and he kept smiling. You know, he's smiling a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  lot in the second term and he's doing things his way and knowing that it was his job to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=404.64s)]
*  fix the mess that all the others had left behind. And that's the angle. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=411.8s)]
*  Well, Trump woke up and cut her this morning and told the shake last night was fun, but [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  I got to go. Look, Atari said, please stay. We have more jets. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=422.2s)]
*  Over. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=434.64s)]
*  Trump said, I love you, but there's someone else. Forty seven then went to one of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=442.88s)]
*  richest countries of all, the United Arab Emirates. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=446.64s)]
*  I love the way. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=464.64s)]
*  Donald Trump was escorted by an army of BMWs and Mercedes. Nice cars, but we prefer made [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=482.32s)]
*  in America for the first time in history. Abu Dhabi closed its biggest mosque so Trump [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=487.28s)]
*  could get a private tour out of respect. President Trump took his shoes off to walk on the largest [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=493.2s)]
*  handmade carpet in the world. He told reporters he was taken by how beautiful the mosque was. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=498.84s)]
*  He said, this is an incredible culture. Pure white marble, as far as you could see. Then [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=504.86s)]
*  47 went to the Royal Palace where he got a hero's welcome. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=511.04s)]
*  At this point, Trump shaken every hand in the Mideast. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=531.6s)]
*  I shook more hands than any human being is capable of doing. That was a long deal and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=535.32s)]
*  they were big people, but they were starving for love because our country didn't give them [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=542.24s)]
*  love. They gave them a fist bump. Remember the fist bump? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=548.08s)]
*  Trump's wrist got so tired from shaking hands. He let Lutnick sign the deal. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=551.6s)]
*  The UAE is investing 1.4 trillion in America. We're building a huge AI data center in their [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=555.76s)]
*  country and they lit up their city red, white and blue to celebrate. But that might have [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=575.76s)]
*  been topped when the Royal awarded Trump with his country's highest honor. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=581.72s)]
*  I am honored to announce that His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Hayyan bestows [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=586.4s)]
*  the Order of Zayed upon President Trump. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=593.4s)]
*  Betting sites have Trump favored to win the Nobel Peace Prize. On this trip, he kind of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=596.28s)]
*  earned it. America spent trillions trying to bring peace to the Middle East and now [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=607.16s)]
*  Trump's making them pay us and they love us. Today, 47 cities getting close to making a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=612.24s)]
*  deal with Iran, but if they don't play ball, things could get ugly. Iran's losing friends [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=618.76s)]
*  in the Middle East. Trump's making nice with the bad boys. This plan's been a decade in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=624.0s)]
*  the making. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=629.04s)]
*  So eight years ago, it was security, the destruction of ISIS, the Abrahamic courts. Now it's prosperity [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=630.04s)]
*  with these incredible deals. The two are inextricably intertwined. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway says this is peace through wealth, but the prosperity only sizzles if [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  you're on our side. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=648.8s)]
*  We don't want India, for instance, continuing to buy weapons from Russia. We obviously want [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=651.4s)]
*  to end the illicit oil trade between China and Iran. We don't want Iran sending drones [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=657.16s)]
*  to Russia. There's a lot of moving parts here, but if you want stability, you need to have [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=665.88s)]
*  stronger ties with some of our partners. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=673.52s)]

*  of course, international inspectors. And that must include American inspectors that will [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=911.5s)]
*  have to supervise the process in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=917.58s)]

*  it. And a lot at stake here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=930.14s)]
*  Speaking this morning, President Trump issued another warning to Iran should this deal fail. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=932.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=939.12s)]
*  You probably read today the story about Iran has sort of agreed to the terms. They're not [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=940.12s)]

*  up being a great country, frankly, but they can't have a nuclear weapon. That's the only [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=958.1s)]
*  thing. It's very simple. It's not like I have to give you 30 pages worth of details. There's [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=962.66s)]
*  only one sentence. They can't have a nuclear weapon. And I think I think we're getting [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=966.9s)]
*  close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this. There's two steps is a very, very [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=972.5400000000001s)]
*  nice step. And there's a violent step, the violence like people haven't seen before. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=978.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't I hope we're not going to have to do this. I don't want to do the second step. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=985.3000000000001s)]

*  Not even a contest. We have the best equipment. Nobody has equipment like us. Nobody has [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1034.02s)]

*  Now, before departing Qatar, the country bestowed one final honor on President Trump and performed [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1077.14s)]
*  a military flyover before he boarded Air Force One. And as it approached Abu Dhabi, the UAE [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1083.34s)]

*  biggest drop in five years if you don't count Joe Biden's testicles. But you want to see how CNN [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1455.96s)]
*  reports it? Here's their headline. Quote, Trump's egg price fiction has suddenly become reality. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1462.96s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's fiction, now reality. Meaning when Trump turns out to be right, it's only because [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1469.96s)]
*  reality caught up to his lies. In CNNese, that headline translates as, he may be right, but he's [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1474.96s)]

*  Oh, Biden wasn't even worth a barf bag and an extra bag of sun chips. You know, it's weird how we're [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1533.96s)]

*  it's not enough. You know, I have that same feeling, but it's for sharing an elevator with Brit Hume after he's had his [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1573.96s)]

*  about the media. We're talking about the media. We're talking about the media. We're talking about the media. We're talking about the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1606.96s)]

*  But what if the filter you use keeps predicting the wrong outcome? When you get tired of that, when you go back to the drawing board, when you see [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1628.96s)]
*  that it doesn't work anymore, it's like when I realized I can't keep firing my secretaries when they won't date me. Again, it's one thing to make [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1638.96s)]

*  The grift isn't just not working out on us. It's not working for them either. And surely by now the media and Dems have heard enough of the criticism. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1655.96s)]
*  They're out of ideas. They're too woke, too disconnected from voters. But it's clear they still ignore it because they haven't changed. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1664.96s)]
*  But what they can't ignore is that the filter they're using to perceive reality predicts nothing except defeat and misery. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1671.96s)]
*  Think of the mindset that led them to embrace the Maryland dad. That led them to think men could play in women's sports. That led them to think this corpse was [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1679.96s)]
*  conscious or this clown could win. Their mindset led them to think parents would accept tampons in boys bathrooms and drag queens in school libraries. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1688.96s)]
*  I could go on, but then I would be late for my pole dancing class. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1699.96s)]
*  Thank you. Reduces stress. I mean, imagine if you were a gambler and you had this system that picked horses, but every single time you lost, wouldn't you dump your [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1703.96s)]
*  betting strategy or at the very least pick up a healthier habit like meth? When your frame of reference leads to defeat at every turn, shouldn't you lose that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1715.96s)]
*  frame of reference? You think they would, but so far they won't. When it comes to self-reflection, the media is less curious than Elton John around a stack of playboys. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1725.96s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. Audience is rooting for him to get off the stage. Writer and comedian Joe DeVito. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1735.96s)]
*  She's got talking points and hollow points. Fonch News, nutritioner and editor for Town Hall. Katie Pavlis. She may be cheerful, but she'll give you an earful. Outnumbered co-host, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1746.96s)]
*  Emi Capagno. And the Statue of Liberty looks up to him. New York Times bestselling author, comedian and former NWA World Champion Tyra. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1759.96s)]
*  Joe, now that egg prices are dropping, will you finally afford breakfast or lunch or whatever you eat? Yes, well I'm still glad I had my eggs frozen a couple years ago. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1778.96s)]
*  I'm tempted to get Jake Tapper's book just so I can read acting like it's a revelation for them to admit to the things we've been saying for four years. It didn't take investigative journalism to know that Joe Biden was a zucchini this whole time. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1793.96s)]
*  Yeah, and they, it's just, they didn't just lie. They insulted us. They said, you remember deep fakes? Yes. They said, oh, this wasn't what you were actually seeing. You weren't actually seeing a president who needed to be airlifted onto the plane. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1809.96s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, I think it's crazy that they have squandered that the news media's job is to tell the truth. Yeah. And when they stop doing that, they've got nothing left. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1823.96s)]
*  You know, and they talked about some of the videos we mentioned. Did Steven Spielberg help with his 30 second promo that he did for his campaign that had 45 edits in it? Yeah. Where he was like, make my day. I'll do the debate. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1833.96s)]
*  Like he, he was so clearly incompetent and I just think, I don't know what they're going to do now. Yeah. I don't know what they're going to do because how do you come back from saying, I know we're supposed to tell the truth, but we lied this time, we lied this time. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1847.96s)]
*  Joe Scarborough said, I wouldn't lie to you when he cursed at you. And you have to look at him and say, is he an idiot? Is he a liar? I say, why choose? I put limits on the man and he can be both. Yes, he can be both. You know, Katie, the thing that that gets me is like we give all this constructive criticism to the media. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1860.96s)]
*  So why don't they just look at the outcomes from their filter? If you wake up every morning expecting like a Trump failure and it's not there, there's something wrong with your filter. Maybe you should change the filter. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1879.96s)]
*  Well, first, Greg, I'm glad to see that you have a new hobby. I was very concerned that you have enough to do. So I'm glad pole dancing is now taking up some of your time. That's a great question. And it's because they are insulated still. They are not willing to actually get out and learn and take some responsibility. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1891.96s)]
*  And they're so narcissistic that they're not willing to say that they were wrong because now there's money to be made. So the same people who were yelling at Lara Trump in the 2020 election that Joe Biden was just had a stutter. There wasn't a incompetence issue there. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1908.96s)]
*  And then now you fast forward five years and now there's money to be made on a shameless book. And it's because they all do this for each other. You know, they scratch each other's back and they are in this isolationist bubble where they really can't come to the terms of just admitting they were wrong. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1923.96s)]
*  And so this has diminishing returns, right? At some point, the circle becomes smaller because some people will leave and they'll have to find something else to do. But they're just not willing to admit it. And they're around all the same people with no differing ideology all the time. So that's why it continues. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1937.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know what, Emily? You're a very happy person. You're very bubbly. You light up a room like an arsonist. When okay, so I'm stuck on this the way they view things and how it's always wrong. That has to correlate with the fact that all of these Democrats look so miserable. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1952.96s)]
*  Imagine getting up and your arch nemesis is always winning and you have to wake up like a competing cheerleader. It's like always besting you. And you're like, I hate this person. Every day that person wins. Isn't it time for you to say, OK, I got to let this go? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1977.96s)]
*  Well, the graceful person would the after school special character in me would say it only ends with death. Yeah, Katie's absolutely right. It's the insular nature. And I think what you're describing, it's so baked in. It's literally impossible for them to extricate themselves from it. It's like learning that someone's behavior, their depression, oh, it was a chemical imbalance. Yeah, there was nothing they could do to actually get over it, to click out of the emperor's new clothes. And the fact that in this this machine of me and my character, I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=1993.96s)]
*  that. And then there's a lot of media that this person goes to the producer and says, I'm going to phrase the headline this way. And then they say, oh, yeah, sure. It's signed off on by a million people. There is zero common sense. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2023.96s)]
*  There's zero auditing happening. That's from an outside source. Forty nine percent, as you said, of people thinking that the media is dying, right? That they hate it. It reminds me of the wicked witch dying slowly that we are watching it. We're watching it in real time. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2034.56s)]
*  And then there's the rise of the independent journalists. People who actually ask questions and podcasts and the like. But there is still this this industry. And so I don't know where it all goes. But I think it's up to the advertising dollars and it's up to the network heads to shut that down. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2048.44s)]
*  Mm hmm. All right. I think this is all these. But this Biden stuff is big and it's going to get bigger. And the media, I think, is looking at it and going like, where are where are we going to end up? They're terrified. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2066.04s)]
*  No, the media is like a husband who's been caught cheating and he has a girlfriend and a wife on the side and a wife. And he got to why he got caught. You got a girlfriend and a wife. Don't correct me. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2084.56s)]
*  He got a girlfriend and a wife on the side. I'm going somewhere with this. They both found out. Right. OK. But in his mind, one of them will come back so he can doesn't have to change anything. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2102.32s)]
*  Oh, so with the media isn't going to change because they still have somebody coming back to them. Yes. Still in their bubble when they tweet, they still get love from their little world. There's no they're trying to get in front. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2116.48s)]
*  What are they trying to do? They're there. And you pointed this out before anybody did. So I'll give you credit for this. They tried to point out physical things. Yeah. Well, he was going to be in a wheelchair. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2135.16s)]
*  And they're like, oh, no. Ever heard of Governor Abbott? Yeah. He doesn't stand up job in Texas. So it's true. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  The ablest would see that as an insult. He does always on his toes. That's good. But the point is, the point is, is that they they still are the criminal in the corner trying to find a way to wiggle out there. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2152.48s)]
*  They're trapped. They're in a corner. But the American people aren't putting enough pressure on them. And they're still they're still getting the blessings of the people who cut their checks. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2170.52s)]
*  Because if this was a moment of awakening, if they were like, hey, this cover up and we're going to clean up the first thing they would do was fire every person on TV who pushed that to the American people. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2179.36s)]
*  That would be the first thing to do. And if Jake Tavern had any credibility, they would resign because they were a willing participant lying to the American people trying to influence elections. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2193.84s)]
*  They're still doing it. Even when Trump has a win and reading the horrible CNN article, there's like, well, at the time when he said eggs were coming down, they weren't down yet. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2203.84s)]
*  So he lied. And then his lie turned into truth. Forty eight hours later. Yeah. So he's still a liar. They're still doing that. They're still the one as it goes back to the cheating thing. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2212.84s)]
*  You catch your wife cheating and she's like, how dare you break into my phone? Yeah. What kind of a person goes to my phone? You're sleeping with my brother. It's not about that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2222.84s)]
*  It's about trust. And you were in my phone. What gives you the right to be in my phone? Yes. You be doing too much. I told you that story and confident. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMYnLJdMco&t=2230.84s)]
