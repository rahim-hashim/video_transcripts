# Fox News Highlights - June 2nd, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM)
*  But first, this is what the left spawned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2.92s)]
*  We can't do nothing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  We can't. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  We're not here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=16.04s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=17.04s)]
*  We have to end this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=18.04s)]
*  And for us, we are terrorists. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=19.04s)]
*  Before we get to that horrific terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, it is important tonight [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=21.04s)]
*  to understand how we got here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=25.28s)]
*  It's because the left loves open borders, they love unlimited immigration, and they [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=28.96s)]
*  love anti-Israel radicalism. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=32.88s)]
*  And under Biden, all their dreams came true. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=35.92s)]
*  More than 10 million, well, we'll never really know the real number, of illegal border crossers, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=39.36s)]
*  gotaways, refugees, special category parolees, and visa overstayers poured into the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=44.6s)]
*  It's a figure so vast that it overwhelms the systems that we have in place to process these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=52.84s)]
*  people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=58.04s)]
*  And that was the goal all along, too big a number to deport. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=59.36s)]
*  Also under Biden, the pro-Hamas, pro-Gaza chaos on college campuses terrified Jewish [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=64.08s)]
*  students and disrupted the education of others. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=69.28s)]
*  This was tolerated and in some cases even encouraged. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=72.76s)]
*  It was considered cool to be anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=77.28s)]
*  And the fact that the chance from the River to the Sea were the chance of a violent terrorist [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=81.44s)]
*  organization, none of it mattered. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  Now Trump was elected in part, in large part I'd say, because most Americans are sick and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  tired of being treated like second class citizens in their own country as millions are allowed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=94.0s)]
*  to come here, stay here, side with terrorists, game the system, or even issue demands. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And the Trump administration is taking action. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  As with every Trump action that's popular though, of course he faces judicial roadblocks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=113.04s)]
*  But he's forging ahead the best he can. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=118.34s)]
*  But we have other problems on the visa front, too. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=121.2s)]
*  Now of course, as we mentioned in Boulder, Colorado, a place you'd not exactly expect [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=124.64s)]
*  to be considered a hotbed of Islamic radicalism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=129.28s)]
*  But with years of uncontrolled immigration and loosey goosey visa systems, anything can [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=133.28s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=138.32s)]
*  Now the details of this latest anti-Semitic attack on American soil are as sickening as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=139.6s)]
*  they are infuriating. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=144.22s)]
*  The man charged literally tried to incinerate people with an incendiary device, including [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=146.22s)]
*  an actual Holocaust survivor, according to one of the friends of the victims. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=153.48s)]
*  Now this location was chosen for one reason and one reason only, because there would be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=158.6s)]
*  Jews there, or at least people who supported Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=162.74s)]
*  The occasion was a regular peaceful gathering to honor the hostages still being held in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=166.48s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=171.44s)]
*  The suspect, he's named Mohammed Sabri Solomon, and surprise, he's here illegally. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=172.56s)]
*  And when he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=184.32s)]
*  He said that he had previously tried to purchase a firearm, but resorted to the Molotov cocktails. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=190.0s)]
*  When he could not purchase a gun, because he was not a legal citizen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  A jihadist in the mountains. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  State charges against him include 16 counts of attempted first degree murder, a use of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=203.2s)]
*  an incendiary device, crimes against the elderly, that's just to name a few. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=207.44s)]
*  And this afternoon the feds charged him with a hate crime involving actual or perceived [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  race, religion, or national origin. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=215.72s)]
*  There were 16 unused Molotov cocktails within arms reach of the subject at the time of his [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=218.98s)]
*  arrest. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=224.64s)]
*  So there is no question that the first responders saved lives and prevented further victims [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=225.64s)]
*  from being injured. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  Of course, beyond the sick Islamist violent nature of this attack is the added fact that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=233.64s)]
*  Solomon should not have been here in the first place. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  An Egyptian national, this depraved lunatic, was granted a tourist visa. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  He arrived at LAX in August of 2022, but never left when he was supposed to in February of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=248.17999999999998s)]
*  2023. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=254.04s)]
*  That's about six months. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=255.04s)]
*  He even filed a claim for asylum in late September of 2022. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  Another scam. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=262.92s)]
*  And somehow with an expired visa, he was still allowed to get work authorization in the United [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=264.36s)]
*  States. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=271.56s)]
*  What? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=272.56s)]
*  Yeah, USCIS gave him permission to work here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=273.56s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=278.08s)]
*  someone who couldn't be bothered to follow our rules as a guest in our country with work [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=280.08s)]
*  permit. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=285.4s)]
*  Now, that was a grave mistake and should never have been allowed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=286.4s)]
*  He's apparently been driving an Uber. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=290.68s)]
*  How reassuring for all you ride sharers. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, according to DHS, there was more than a half million suspected visa overstays at [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  the end of fiscal year 2023. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=302.76s)]
*  But of course, at this point, that number could be much higher. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=305.4s)]
*  I can't imagine it's not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=307.56s)]
*  We had better get a handle on this and take action. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=309.6s)]
*  On the campaign trail, President Trump was cheered most enthusiastically when he promised [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=313.38s)]
*  to carry out mass deportations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=318.08s)]
*  I was at those rallies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=320.62s)]
*  And of course, again, he has activist judges to deal with and he needs more money from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=321.62s)]
*  Congress and the manpower to carry out these deportations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=326.4s)]
*  But each and every one of the millions of foreigners are who are here without authorization, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=331.14s)]
*  either because they cross the border illegally or fail to follow the clear provisions of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  their visas, should leave or immediately be deported. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=340.68s)]
*  Republicans in Congress, senators looking over the big, beautiful bill, should make [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=345.92s)]
*  sure that there are adequate funds to carry out the basic mission of government to keep [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=349.68s)]
*  our country safe, to enforce our laws. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=354.44000000000005s)]
*  I was thinking about this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=358.36s)]
*  I was watching that, you know, capturing bin Laden thing on Netflix and I was thinking, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=359.36s)]
*  gosh, it's been 26 years almost since 9-11. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=363.04s)]
*  And it was the worst attack on American soil. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=366.8s)]
*  But this was carried out in part by hijackers who were on expired visas, including Mohammed [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=369.44s)]
*  Atta, the ringleader, who, by the way, was also an Egyptian. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=374.0s)]
*  And the 9-11 Commission's final report gave specific recommendations regarding the visa [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=377.76s)]
*  process, including biometric identifiers like digital photos and fingerprints that track [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=382.6s)]
*  all exit and entry data both ways. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, many of the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission have never been implemented. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=394.24s)]
*  But of course, people still have to take their shoes off on TSA and still have a slow bureaucratic [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=399.4s)]
*  mess there at the airports. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=404.28s)]
*  Chris Kovach, an old friend, raised a good point on X yesterday. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  After the attacks, he designed a system to alert law enforcement, state law enforcement, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=410.9s)]
*  whenever an illegal from a high-risk country overstayed his visa. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  So what happened to that program? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=421.52s)]
*  Well, Obama canceled it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=423.48s)]
*  Outrageous. Thanks, Barack. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=426.16s)]
*  Now, this is completely unacceptable. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=428.28s)]
*  And now it's turned deadly. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=430.44s)]
*  Along with the normalization of anti-Jewish hate, the festering sores that we've seen [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  on college campuses, this is the backdrop. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=437.48s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago here in D.C., we were reporting on the young couple gunned down [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=440.68s)]
*  at the hands of another pro-Palestinian radical who thought he was doing the world a favor. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=443.84s)]
*  And just like this attacker, by the way, who according to a police said he wanted to kill [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=450.56s)]
*  all the Zionist people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=453.64s)]
*  Any politician who tries to argue that illegals have a right to be here or that visa overstayers [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=456.56s)]
*  should be shown leniency either doesn't have the brain power to understand the stakes or [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  doesn't give a rip about America. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=469.18s)]

*  The number one priority of our government has to be to keep American people safe. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=474.52s)]
*  The Biden administration, whoever was in charge, committed, and I said this repeatedly, 2022 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=481.12s)]

*  All of them, including Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden, Harris, they all put us in danger and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=491.08s)]
*  they knew they were doing it, but they thought they were safe. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  Their people were safe. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=499.32s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=500.32s)]
*  So congressional Republicans, they had to fight to get information last year about the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=502.2s)]
*  terror threats because of Biden's open border. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=507.64s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=509.92s)]
*  And yeah, they finally found out that the Biden people even released a hundred people [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=510.92s)]
*  on the terror watch list into America. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=514.92s)]
*  Wonder what they are. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=517.72s)]
*  They all drive in Ubers? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=518.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is 100 percent correct to do everything in his power at every level to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=521.2s)]
*  secure our border and to deport anyone here who has broken the law. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=527.38s)]
*  ICE has managed to deport about 85,000 people so far. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=532.62s)]
*  We've got about 15 million to go, do the math. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=537.9s)]
*  Now if a Democrat wins in 2028, expect another 10 million to be let in during another four [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=541.46s)]

*  That is their policy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=547.86s)]
*  It's not an accident. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=549.3s)]
*  We should never let this issue go. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=551.5s)]
*  It is our country. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=554.26s)]
*  It is our safety. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=555.5s)]
*  And it's a political winner because Americans understand how very high the stakes are. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=556.86s)]
*  It's life or death. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=562.02s)]

*  Biden world is starting to crack and the big guys getting the whistle blown on them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=565.74s)]
*  Secret service agents are coming out of the woodwork saying behind the scenes, Joe was [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=570.16s)]
*  even worse than we thought. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=574.94s)]
*  This secret service whistleblower actually was a sign to Biden. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=577.34s)]
*  When he told me that Biden used to get lost in his closet in the mornings in the White [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=580.6s)]
*  House, I mean, the guy literally stumbling around in the White House residence couldn't [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  find his way out of his own closet. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=590.32s)]
*  The president of the United States. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=593.44s)]
*  I mean, this is outrageous. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  The leader of the free world couldn't find his way out of the closet and no one noticed. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  Joe was locked inside while his team was out running the country. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=602.72s)]
*  The speaker said when he went to the White House, Biden didn't even know what he'd signed [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=606.32s)]
*  off on. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=611.12s)]
*  Sir, why did you pause LNG exports to Europe? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=612.12s)]
*  Like I don't understand, you know, liquefied natural gas is in great demand by our allies. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=616.36s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=620.6s)]
*  Because you understand, we just talked about Ukraine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=621.6s)]
*  You understand you're fueling Vladimir Putin's war machine because they got to get their [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=623.6400000000001s)]
*  gas from him. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, and he looks at me stunned with this and he said, I didn't do that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, yes, you did. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  It was an executive order, like, you know, three weeks ago. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=635.44s)]
*  He goes, I didn't do that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=637.4000000000001s)]
*  And he's arguing with me. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  He genuinely did not know what he had signed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't even know what the Biden foreign policy was. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  That's how bad it was. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=645.5200000000001s)]
*  Democrats all knew Joe's brain was fried. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=647.72s)]
*  There's a Senator, Senator Bennett from Colorado, who went to an event in June 2024 where Biden [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=650.8800000000001s)]
*  seemed non-functioning and he left that event. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=656.0400000000001s)]
*  And this is in the book thinking this is why our border policy, our immigration policy, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  such a mess. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  They can't manage the portfolio. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  They're competing groups within the administration and he's not engaged for whatever reason. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=666.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's why this policy is such a mess. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=673.0s)]
*  Did Biden even know the border was wide open? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  If he didn't, then who opened it? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  That's what the hearings will find out. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=681.48s)]
*  Bill Maher, he's wondering why Democrats even let Joe run. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=683.56s)]
*  If you really thought Trump was the existential threat he was, then, you know, to your point [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=688.0s)]
*  earlier, why put up Biden? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=693.8s)]
*  If it was really that important? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=696.72s)]
*  I mean, Democrats will never be able to answer that question. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=698.16s)]
*  If that election was really that important, you couldn't summon the courage to confront [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=701.36s)]
*  an old man that your time has passed? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=706.72s)]
*  Well, that's a good question. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=709.4s)]
*  Democrats knew Joe was fried back in 2020 and they all backed him up on the campaign [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=711.64s)]
*  trail. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=716.48s)]
*  He was forgetting the names of aides he'd worked with for 40 years. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=717.48s)]
*  Staffers were alarmed and would whisper how the big guy wasn't 100 percent. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=720.8s)]
*  They thought it was a miracle that COVID happened and Joe went into the bunker. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=725.92s)]
*  But Slick Willie swears for four years he didn't know a thing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=730.28s)]
*  Did you ever have a moment with him where you thought maybe he was unfit to run for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  president? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=742.3599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=743.3599999999999s)]
*  I thought he was a good president. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=744.3599999999999s)]
*  The only concern I thought he had to deal with was could anybody do that job until they [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=748.0s)]
*  were 86? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=754.36s)]
*  And we'd had several long talks. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=756.16s)]
*  I had never seen him and walked away thinking he can't do this anymore. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=757.88s)]
*  He was always on top of his brief. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=762.72s)]
*  You never saw any kind of decline? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=765.32s)]
*  So I didn't know anything about any of this and I haven't read the book. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=767.92s)]
*  I saw President Biden not very long ago and I thought he was in good shape. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=772.96s)]
*  We knew Bubba was in great shape when he was president. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=777.64s)]
*  He never wandered into a closet alone. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=780.24s)]

*  Chuck Todd says no, no, no, no, not so fast. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=786.8s)]

*  At the end of the day, no journalist is as good as their sources. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=804.76s)]
*  The end of the day, the Democratic Party lied to the American people. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=808.32s)]
*  The leadership of the party lied to the American people and that's where this scandal should [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=811.76s)]

*  Joe was weak and the only action the party took in four years was whacking them. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=865.8s)]
*  Besides that, they got nothing done. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=870.28s)]

*  That's gotta drive Chuck nuts. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=940.68s)]
*  The senator doesn't even fight back. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=942.8s)]
*  He just sits there with his legs crossed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=944.88s)]
*  His term's up in 26. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=947.28s)]
*  It's time for him to go. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=948.84s)]
*  And everyone knows it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that they can continue with the current elites that are in power. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=952.52s)]
*  I don't think with Pelosi and Schumer... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=955.88s)]
*  They got to go! [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  They've lost the people. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=958.8s)]
*  I just told Chris this. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=959.84s)]
*  These are culture wars. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=962.36s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't... [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=963.68s)]
*  Democrats just don't know how to play culture. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=964.88s)]
*  And you want to know why they don't know? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=966.72s)]
*  Because they're not in the culture. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=968.8s)]
*  They're in Ivy League institutions. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=970.68s)]

*  They're patting themselves on the back on golf courses. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=975.92s)]
*  They are not in with the regular people. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=978.04s)]
*  Now, you could say the same thing about Trump. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=979.68s)]
*  You could say on paper the exact same thing about Trump and the Republicans. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=981.88s)]
*  But then why do they keep doing this? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  Because... Because... [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=986.64s)]
*  Because they are in culture! [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  Democrats are scrambling to find a new face. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  And the only thing they can agree on is no more Kamala. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  Some don't even want her to run for California governor. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=995.16s)]
*  Tim Walz was out campaigning in South Carolina this weekend, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=998.84s)]

*  ate fried fish with hot sauce and thanked blacks. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1004.52s)]
*  And then Tampon said Democrats need to be bigger bullies. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1008.36s)]
*  I'm getting called out on this [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1012.64s)]
*  because I called Donald Trump a wannabe dictator. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1014.52s)]
*  It's because he is. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1017.64s)]

*  Oh. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1021.88s)]
*  The governor's being mean, and the governor's speaking out on that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1024.92s)]
*  Well, maybe it's time for us to be a little meaner. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1028.24s)]
*  The thing that bothers a teacher more than anything is to watch a bully. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1030.48s)]
*  To watch this bully and to stop it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1034.5600000000002s)]
*  And when it's a child, you talk to him, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  and you tell him why bullying's wrong. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1039.5600000000002s)]
*  But when it's adult like Donald Trump, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1041.68s)]
*  you bully the shit out of him back. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1043.5200000000002s)]
*  You push back. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  After arresting him, calling him a Nazi, and shooting him, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1046.68s)]
*  I'm worried about what being a bigger bully looks like. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1049.92s)]
*  Instead of fighting Trump, Tampon should fight for you. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1054.68s)]
*  Democrats don't even want kids in schools to take tests [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1058.16s)]
*  because it's not equitable, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1061.8400000000001s)]

*  If we want to talk about something, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1066.92s)]

*  he really has the cognitive ability [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1070.6000000000001s)]

*  And whether or not the 25th Amendment should apply [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1075.1200000000001s)]

*  because you have to explain it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1101.2s)]
*  Plus, like Greg said, everyone loves tacos. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1103.52s)]

*  and now they want their vote. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  If Democrats want to win men, they should be men. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1115.9599999999998s)]

*  in the checkout counter at Walmart, okay? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1134.76s)]
*  Just use the language that the people use [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1138.12s)]
*  and then relate to them. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1141.12s)]
*  The most important thing is we now know we have a problem. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1142.76s)]
*  And I don't think we can go and solve the problem [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1146.68s)]
*  or address the problem by acting like we bros in some pool hall [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1150.28s)]
*  or sitting around the street, you know, playing numbers or something. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1155.84s)]
*  We could address it by talking about the struggles [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1160.12s)]
*  that young people and young men go through. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1162.64s)]

*  Don't fall asleep in there like Joe. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1168.52s)]
*  But first, back here at home, our top story, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1170.8s)]
*  it is hard to imagine a more divisive, mean-spirited Democratic Party. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1173.12s)]
*  In fact, their constant hysteria has long spilled over into outright violence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1177.28s)]
*  And to make matters worse, and we're going to look at this [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1183.52s)]
*  from a whole different perspective, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1185.92s)]
*  their policies have put all of you at risk. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1187.92s)]
*  This is something we have warned about over and over and over again, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1192.08s)]
*  the number one preventable national security risk. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1196.52s)]
*  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1203.4799999999998s)]
*  Have you heard those words from me? Take a look. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1205.1999999999998s)]
*  And as I've been warning, I would say with almost 100% certainty, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1208.56s)]
*  and again, I pray I'm wrong. I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1212.28s)]
*  The terrorists are taking advantage of Joe's open borders, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1215.6s)]
*  and there are terror cells likely in this country plotting, planning, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1219.32s)]
*  scheming, and attacking against our homeland. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1222.4399999999998s)]
*  And the blame for that will lie squarely on the shoulders of Joe Biden. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1225.3999999999999s)]
*  Sadly, over the weekend, our prediction again came true. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1229.96s)]

*  still being held inside of Gaza. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1257.24s)]
*  This was a terrorist attack, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1258.56s)]
*  and this is not the big one I'm warning about. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1260.92s)]
*  That could happen at any point, any time. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1263.08s)]
*  They are plotting, planning, scheming. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1266.08s)]
*  We have known terrorists in this country, murderers, rapists, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1268.08s)]
*  known cartel members, known gang members, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1271.76s)]
*  Joe, Kamala, Mayorkas, all let him in unvetted. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1274.12s)]
*  And by the way, this was a deranged individual [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1278.56s)]
*  allowed into our country by Biden, Harris, Mayorkas, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1281.6399999999999s)]
*  and then gifted a work permit after he broke our immigration laws. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1285.08s)]
*  This is what I mean when I say Democrats have blood on their hands. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1289.24s)]
*  All those names have blood on their hands. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1293.36s)]
*  In fact, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1295.6s)]
*  pay close attention. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1298.36s)]
*  Biden was president 21 to 24. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1299.8s)]
*  There were more than 50 cases of related, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1302.8799999999999s)]

*  actually in charge of the swamp, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1316.32s)]
*  from keeping your borders wide open. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1318.24s)]

*  It is past time for Democrats, the media mob, legacy media mob, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1330.84s)]
*  to come to terms with the political violence [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1335.1999999999998s)]

*  What have we chronicled on this program? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1343.04s)]
*  You know, selective, feign, phony, moral outrage from Democrats [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1345.32s)]
*  and the legacy media mob. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1349.56s)]
*  Every day, how many times did they obsess over Charlottesville? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1351.08s)]
*  And they never put it in its proper context. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  They never talked about January 6. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1358.0s)]
*  Many of you will peacefully, patriotically march to the Capitol [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1359.9199999999998s)]
*  so your voices will be heard. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1364.72s)]
*  They never talked to the driver of the beast that said, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  No, Donald Trump never tried to commandeer the vehicle. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1369.24s)]
*  They accused President Trump of inciting violence. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1372.48s)]
*  Biden's DOJ treated angry parents at school board meetings [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1375.88s)]
*  like domestic terrorists. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1379.28s)]
*  They did the same thing with traditional Catholics. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1380.72s)]
*  They went after peaceful anti-abortion protesters. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1383.24s)]
*  They, in their case, were locked up. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1386.68s)]
*  Remember the elderly grandmother sentenced to years in prison? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1388.76s)]
*  They told us that right-wing extremism [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1392.0s)]
*  was the greatest existential threat to our country. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1394.88s)]
*  But as per usual, they were lying or delusional. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1398.0s)]
*  In fact, the extremism has been coming [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1401.48s)]
*  from inside of their own party. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1404.32s)]
*  And to this day, they still don't seem to care. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1405.84s)]
*  Let's take you back circa 2020, the summer of love, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1409.24s)]
*  violent left-wing riots ripping across this country, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1413.24s)]
*  killing dozens of Americans, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1416.92s)]
*  causing billions of property damage. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1419.08s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, cops were pelted with bricks, rocks, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1421.32s)]
*  bottles, Molotov cocktails, 574 riots in total [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1425.48s)]
*  that we categorized as riots and much more violence. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1430.16s)]
*  And here's how top Democrats reacted. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1434.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris said, the rioters, they're not gonna stop. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1437.44s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1440.6s)]
*  And we're not gonna stop supporting them. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1442.12s)]
*  So beware, take note. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1444.28s)]
*  She said that to Stephen Colbert. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1446.28s)]
*  And then Democrats went out and voted for her. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1448.36s)]
*  Few Democrats had the courage to tell the truth, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1450.56s)]
*  to condemn even the worst riots in 2020 [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1453.44s)]
*  that killed two dozen Americans. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1456.8s)]
*  That kind of political violence, all but excused, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1459.24s)]
*  from the far left and it continued year in and year out. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1463.0s)]
*  You have a deranged individual trying to assassinate [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1466.72s)]
*  US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his home. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1469.64s)]
*  The doxing of Supreme Court justices, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1472.8s)]
*  President Trump surviving too would be assassins. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1475.2s)]
*  Democrats openly calling for both Trump and Elon [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1478.44s)]
*  Musk to be killed. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1481.44s)]
*  Musk's flagship company, Tesla, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1482.92s)]
*  targeted with domestic terrorism time and time and time again, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  dozens of cars, dealerships, charging stations, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1490.68s)]
*  vandalized, shot at, burned. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1494.1200000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, the behavior from the far left, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1496.28s)]
*  free Palestine crowd is even worse. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1498.3600000000001s)]
*  Guy Benson, I think put it best. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  He said, if a right wing movement had burned down [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  a governor's mansion, murdered two foreign diplomats, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1505.44s)]
*  fired bomb kids and elderly people at a peaceful protest, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  in the span of two weeks, what would the coverage look like? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  What sort of national conversation [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1517.12s)]
*  would Democrats be having? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1519.12s)]
*  But the pro-Palestinian crowd, well, they are undeterred [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1520.8s)]
*  and few elected Democrats have ever had the courage [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1524.76s)]
*  to speak out. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1528.84s)]
*  They are afraid of the squad. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1529.6599999999999s)]
*  They're afraid of their radical base. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1531.36s)]
*  Just today, so-called pro-Palestine demonstrators [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1532.9599999999998s)]
*  storming a stage in an event with the US Navy secretary. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1536.08s)]
*  So let me be very clear tonight. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1540.52s)]
*  The Democratic party will tolerate vile anti-Semitism. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1542.52s)]
*  They will tolerate 574 riots that kill Americans, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  cause billions in damage and injure thousands of cops, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1552.06s)]
*  while feigning selective moral outrage [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1556.6999999999998s)]
*  over one riot at a Capitol years ago [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1561.6999999999998s)]
*  if their side can excuse it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1565.88s)]
*  If they can use it for political purposes. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  If not, if it's their side, they ignore it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1571.92s)]
*  They lie about it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1574.2800000000002s)]
*  They can lie and make it up when it's about Trump [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1575.5200000000002s)]
*  and pretend to be outraged, but it's phony. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1578.7600000000002s)]
*  It's fake. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  It is political in nature. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1583.2800000000002s)]
*  And frankly, it's despicable. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1585.4s)]
*  The fact that Democrats never stood for two moms [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1588.0s)]
*  at the joint session speech of Donald Trump [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1591.2800000000002s)]
*  that lost their children [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1594.2s)]
*  because of their open border policies. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1595.8400000000001s)]
*  They couldn't even stand for this young man who had cancer. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1597.68s)]
*  Apparently the cancer we learned over the weekend came back. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1600.04s)]
*  Our prayers are with that young 13-year-old man. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1602.92s)]
*  They couldn't stand for moms that lost their children. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1606.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Mayorkas, they never called. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1609.4s)]
*  Blake and Riley's family, Rachel Moran's family, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1612.42s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungary's family, the dozens and dozens [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1614.98s)]
*  and dozens and dozens of other families, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1617.64s)]
*  victims of murder, rape, violent crimes that they caused [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1619.92s)]
*  because of their wide open border policies with no vetting. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1623.78s)]
*  The legacy media mob gives them cover the entire way. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1627.02s)]
*  Axios today openly worrying that Trump would use [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1630.32s)]
*  this weekend's terror attacks to further [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1633.34s)]
*  his anti-illegal immigration agenda. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1635.78s)]
*  No, it is, we've got to vet illegals. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1638.54s)]
*  A lot of terrorists came into this country. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1641.5s)]
*  A lot of gang members, cartel members, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1643.42s)]
*  violent people, murderers, rapists came into our country. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1645.34s)]
*  And other outlets jumped through linguistic hoops [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1648.98s)]
*  trying to obscure the motives of the attacker. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1653.74s)]
*  And remember, these reports in 2020, reporters, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1656.42s)]
*  this is my favorite, claiming, oh, well, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1659.38s)]
*  look at that picture right there. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1662.46s)]
*  That report, look what it said at the bottom of that screen, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1663.9s)]
*  mostly peaceful protests. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1666.42s)]
*  Look over the reporter's shoulder. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1668.5s)]
*  Does that look peaceful to you? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1670.74s)]
*  That's what fake news CNN told you. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1672.74s)]
*  MSDNC said the same thing. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1674.5s)]
*  And they wonder why the legacy media mob state run is dead. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  This is more than just a political game. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1682.2s)]
*  American lives are at stake. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  The media will talk about Israel's role [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1686.16s)]
*  and remind us which religion is the religion of peace. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1688.28s)]
*  But we know the truth. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  Trump pointed it out and was called racist for it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1692.8s)]
*  How many victims resulted from Democrats [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1696.0s)]
*  mocking our fears about the border? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  And like always, the media focuses [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1701.1200000000001s)]
*  on the Trump administration's reaction, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1702.8s)]
*  not the fiery attack itself. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1705.48s)]
*  On CNN, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1707.56s)]
*  slammed Cash Patel for calling it terrorism. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1710.36s)]
*  CNN national security analyst Juliette Caim did the same. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1713.36s)]
*  Because it's never the attack, it's the reaction. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1717.24s)]
*  So as normal people fume that this illegal [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1721.2s)]
*  was led into exact terror, shameless Dems feign disgust, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1723.28s)]
*  then retreat to uselessness, or worse. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1727.52s)]
*  How soon before Chris Van Hollen visits and orders [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1730.6799999999998s)]
*  a mimosa with two straws? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1733.4399999999998s)]
*  Don't order the cocktail. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's simple. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1739.76s)]
*  Vicious terror attacks are carried out against Americans [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1740.6s)]
*  in the name of a faraway cause [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1743.84s)]
*  that's driven by lies and hate. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1745.56s)]
*  You can out-kill an American here in the name of Intifada, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1747.72s)]
*  pushed by well-funded West-hating radicals. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1751.0s)]
*  But for the left and the media, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1753.96s)]
*  there's always something worse than terrorism. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1755.08s)]
*  It's being wrong. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1758.16s)]
*  For us, a terror attack spurs anger and frustration, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1759.92s)]
*  but the media, they go on the defensive. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1762.64s)]
*  Because it is far worse for them to admit [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1765.2s)]
*  they backed the wrong side. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  There goes their false sense of moral superiority, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1768.88s)]
*  the kind that justified burning looted cities, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1771.6000000000001s)]
*  the kind seen on those signs on front lawns and suburbs, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1775.0s)]
*  signs in which the inhabitants profess their sanctimony. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1779.0400000000002s)]
*  But there's nothing on those signs [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1782.44s)]
*  that speaks to the things we experience. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1784.16s)]
*  Why isn't there a sign that states the obvious like, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1787.2800000000002s)]
*  we don't kill Jews here? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1790.2s)]
*  Or we don't believe in protecting violent illegals? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1792.7600000000002s)]
*  You know, it could read like this. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1795.88s)]
*  We don't kill Jews here. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1798.28s)]
*  We believe in legal immigration. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1801.08s)]
*  We defend the Second Amendment. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1803.44s)]
*  We want strong borders. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1805.44s)]
*  We believe men can't be women, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1807.36s)]
*  and we can't stand Jesse Watters. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1809.56s)]
*  He's just a hunk. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1812.76s)]
*  But, you know, maybe people don't want a Molotov [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1818.84s)]
*  thrown through their living room window. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1821.0s)]
*  So they pretend that evil can only be Trump and America, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1823.32s)]
*  which means every real evil can stroll right in. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1827.32s)]
*  Let's welcome, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1831.56s)]
*  the first guest. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1832.76s)]
*  He's Hispanic, who makes liberals panic. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1835.3999999999999s)]
*  Former Trump advisor, Steve Cortez. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1838.72s)]
*  Even motivational speakers tell him to give up [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  after writer and comedian, Jamie Lissow. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1846.6s)]
*  She went from partying with rock stars [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1850.96s)]
*  to avoiding Brian Kilmeade in the halls. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1853.1599999999999s)]
*  Host of Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1855.24s)]
*  And he's the reason CVS ran out of Father's Day cards. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1859.48s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1863.68s)]
*  comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1864.72s)]
*  So, Steve, pretty glum topic for a Monday show, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1873.24s)]
*  but what is your take on the reaction to this [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1876.24s)]
*  and how it came to be? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1879.36s)]
*  Well, first, not glum, though. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1880.76s)]
*  Your nickname for me, your motto, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1881.96s)]
*  the Hispanic who makes lefties panic, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1883.4s)]
*  I love it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1885.08s)]
*  Do I owe you for that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1885.76s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1886.8s)]
*  I get a 10% royalty in perpetuity. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1887.6399999999999s)]
*  I learned that from Kevin O'Leary. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1889.76s)]
*  Okay, wonderful. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1891.32s)]
*  Well, listen, on this, you know, grave attack, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1892.52s)]
*  incredibly violent attack upon Americans, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1895.6799999999998s)]
*  I think a couple of things are worth noting. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1897.48s)]
*  First is that Americans need to be armed, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1899.24s)]
*  but particularly Jewish Americans, right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1902.28s)]
*  This is a very unfortunate, I think, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1904.24s)]
*  reminder of that stark reality. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1905.6s)]
*  But secondly, that Biden's open border, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1907.28s)]
*  leaving the front door of America wide open for years, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1909.6399999999999s)]
*  has incredibly intense consequences [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1913.76s)]
*  that may last, unfortunately, four years. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1916.28s)]
*  How many more cretins like him are there in America [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1918.48s)]
*  who came in unvetted, unwelcome, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1921.28s)]
*  but nonetheless present in our country? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1923.84s)]
*  Thankfully, President Trump has gotten to work [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1926.0s)]
*  immediately on this, and the border is already under control [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1928.0s)]
*  just weeks into this new term. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  So as awful as this situation is, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1932.88s)]
*  we can also celebrate that it's unlikely [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1934.76s)]
*  more jerks like this are coming in right now under Trump. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1937.04s)]
*  Bit well said. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1940.84s)]
*  Jamie, you are unwelcome and unvetted. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1942.96s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1945.3600000000001s)]
*  I cannot wait to hear your finely crafted jokes [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1946.2s)]
*  on this topic. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1950.48s)]
*  Go ahead, start. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't trust anybody [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1953.28s)]
*  with no shirt and jeans. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1955.2s)]
*  I know! [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1957.1200000000001s)]
*  No one without a shirt and jeans has ever showed up [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1957.96s)]
*  and done a good deed. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1963.6000000000001s)]
*  That is true. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1964.76s)]
*  That is true. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  I heard... [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1968.44s)]
*  Well done. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1970.64s)]
*  I heard when Kamala heard this story, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1971.48s)]
*  she was like, Molotov cocktail, I'll have one. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1972.96s)]
*  And then she goes, it's 9 a.m. somewhere. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1975.16s)]
*  Three! [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1984.56s)]
*  You got three so far, I'm amazed. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1986.56s)]
*  I do feel for the people of Colorado, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1988.24s)]
*  it's just they're great people, it's obviously a tragedy. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  When I went to Boulder, Colorado, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1993.32s)]
*  I went right where this kinda happened, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1995.0s)]
*  right around the corner, and when I called them, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1996.88s)]
*  I go, I'm gonna be at the club at like seven, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1998.4s)]
*  and the guy goes, he goes, okay, but he goes, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=1999.92s)]
*  bring oxygen, and I go, listen, Greg, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2001.96s)]
*  I'm not the most famous comedian in the world, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2004.8000000000002s)]
*  but I feel like that's something the club should provide. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2006.64s)]
*  Four! [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2009.4s)]
*  Well done, my friend. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2017.96s)]
*  Can he go for five? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2018.8000000000002s)]
*  And here's the pitch. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2020.0s)]
*  Swung on and missed. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2023.88s)]
*  No, he's gonna pass. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna pass. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2026.68s)]
*  Good for you, Kennedy. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2027.52s)]
*  Don't you get the sense that it's actually the fact [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2030.72s)]
*  that they might be wrong is worse than a terror act [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2033.44s)]
*  for the media, because they've been pushing this narrative? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2036.68s)]
*  We heard about this massacre [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2039.88s)]
*  that apparently happened over the weekend, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2041.3200000000002s)]
*  and that it just kinda went away. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2042.96s)]
*  Yeah, and that in and of itself is part of the problem [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2044.5200000000002s)]
*  of this anti-Semitism, this malignant anti-Semitism [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2048.6800000000003s)]
*  that has taken hold, and it's deadly in this country, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2053.28s)]
*  and when it's not deadly, that is accidental, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2056.36s)]
*  because it is intended to take as many lives [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2058.6s)]
*  and cause as much harm as possible, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2061.4s)]
*  and unfortunately, some of the most vocal members [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2063.92s)]
*  of the Free Free Palestine movement are also very murderous. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2067.7999999999997s)]
*  So a week and a half ago, I was in Poland with Guy Benson [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2071.92s)]
*  and Emily Campagno and Mary Catherine Ham [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  and Molly Hemingway, and we went to Treblinka, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2079.04s)]
*  which was a death camp, an extermination camp. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2082.92s)]
*  We went to Majdanek, which was a concentration camp, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2085.72s)]
*  Auschwitz and Birkenau, where a million and a half people [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2089.44s)]
*  were killed, and as we're going through this journey, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2092.56s)]
*  it's really heavy, and it's kind of stunning [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2095.9199999999996s)]
*  that what happened there, the psychological manipulation [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2098.96s)]
*  and the extermination of millions and millions of Jews [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2102.4199999999996s)]
*  and Catholic Poles, there are a lot of people [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2105.22s)]
*  who actively hope that they could make that happen again, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2107.72s)]
*  and they may not have the sophistication of the SS, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2110.68s)]
*  but you do have this murderous intent [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2114.76s)]
*  of people who are hell bent, and while we were there, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2117.0800000000004s)]
*  the young couple that was just about to get engaged in DC [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2121.6400000000003s)]
*  who worked for the Israeli embassy, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2125.2000000000003s)]
*  they were at a Jewish museum in DC, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2127.0400000000004s)]
*  and they were gunned down. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2129.28s)]
*  Josh Shapiro, the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2130.88s)]
*  his house was set on fire. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2134.32s)]
*  So my question is, if the media turns away, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2136.48s)]
*  are you doing it in a way that is almost complicit [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2140.0s)]
*  and fanning the flames of other hateful people [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2143.28s)]
*  who really would like to, in their own awful way, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2146.5600000000004s)]
*  accomplish what the Nazis did during World War II [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2150.0s)]
*  at those camps? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2152.84s)]
*  Fair point. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2153.96s)]
*  Jamie, you got a joke for that? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2156.8s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2158.0800000000004s)]
*  Tyrus, the identity politics thing is interesting to me. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2159.96s)]
*  I don't know if you caught on, like how it just kind of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2163.1400000000003s)]
*  goes away. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2165.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, I think we need to, there's two things about it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2165.92s)]
*  I don't know how many videos over the last three, four years [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2169.84s)]
*  that we saw of military-aged young men in shape [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2174.84s)]
*  from all walks of life walking into this country, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2178.48s)]
*  and then at midnight being flown to different parts [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2181.2799999999997s)]
*  of America. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2184.2s)]
*  And now we're starting to see some of them come out. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  But here's the deal, they're being protected [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  and helped by Americans. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2191.92s)]
*  So if you look at it, if I was to do that for somebody, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2195.96s)]
*  I would be held accountable. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2200.0800000000004s)]
*  If I knew somebody was doing something [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2200.92s)]
*  and I allowed them in my house and I helped them do things, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2201.76s)]
*  like the people who gave this guy a work visa [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2204.28s)]
*  need to be held accountable. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2207.04s)]
*  Your actions caused a massacre. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2208.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's not even unapologetic. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2211.48s)]
*  He was like, hey, no big deal. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2213.2000000000003s)]
*  He confessed on the spot. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2215.28s)]
*  That is blatant arrogance. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2216.92s)]
*  That is to the point of evil to where, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2218.5s)]
*  and he didn't just get like that by himself. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  He just chose to be first. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2224.0800000000004s)]
*  So now the good news is that we have ICE in place. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2226.16s)]
*  We have law enforcement who's backed and has dignity again. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2230.3199999999997s)]
*  But the problem is, is we don't know [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2233.08s)]
*  where any of them really are. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2235.0s)]
*  And when you have sanctuary cities that are high, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  these governors that sit there with their smug asses [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2239.52s)]
*  and hide these murderous men, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2242.36s)]
*  they didn't come here looking for the American dream [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2244.36s)]
*  because if they did, as soon as they got into California [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2246.7599999999998s)]
*  or Texas, they would look for jobs [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2249.4s)]
*  because that's where the jobs are at [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  when you're good with your hands. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2252.5s)]
*  They'd be making money and sending home [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2253.68s)]
*  to their families, like actual immigrants [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2256.52s)]
*  who come to this country. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2258.04s)]
*  They came here with a purpose. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2258.92s)]
*  It also wasn't a small mistake [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2260.32s)]
*  when we look back at those films. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2261.52s)]
*  All of them had nice clean shoes. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2262.96s)]
*  All of them had nice stuff and they had little wristbands. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2264.48s)]
*  If you remember, where am I going? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2266.96s)]
*  Oh, Philadelphia. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2268.76s)]
*  Who was filling this out for him? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2270.2000000000003s)]
*  We're starting to see this and it's disheartening [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2272.2000000000003s)]
*  and scary because now to your point [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2276.2000000000003s)]
*  when you said Jewish people need to start carrying guns, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2278.6000000000004s)]
*  no, everybody does. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  Because as soon as you, no, seriously. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2282.96s)]
*  You cannot, Greg makes jokes, he's a talented guy. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2286.76s)]
*  He goes somewhere and they're like, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  well, he's from the right. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  He's part of the problem. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2293.76s)]
*  So I'm gonna be a hero [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2294.88s)]
*  because I'm gonna take down a Gutfeld. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2295.88s)]
*  You don't do that because I got kids to support [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2297.28s)]
*  as you heard in the beginning. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2299.1200000000003s)]
*  So five. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2300.36s)]
*  But it's terrible the fact that we're seeing this [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2303.5600000000004s)]
*  and the media, they are part of the problem. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2306.96s)]
*  They help with the hiding, they help with all this stuff. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2309.7200000000003s)]
*  They are the propaganda media of the left [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2313.72s)]
*  and they still are okay with what is going on. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2316.12s)]
*  That's why they're not covering the story [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2318.7599999999998s)]
*  because what we always talked about, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2319.88s)]
*  they cracked a few eggs. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2321.48s)]
*  It's one thing. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2322.6s)]
*  There's 700,000 ones that are doing good. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2323.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2326.04s)]
*  All right, let's do something lighter. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2326.88s)]
*  Something really light. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2329.56s)]
*  Tamp on Timmy. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2331.0s)]
*  Woo! [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fakAYCFbcWM&t=2332.08s)]
