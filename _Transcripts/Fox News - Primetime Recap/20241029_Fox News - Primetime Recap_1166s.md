# Fox News Highlights - Oct. 28, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. An unstoppable force. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=0.0s)]
*  Well respected polling analyst tonight Nate Silver has Trump now with a 55 percent chance of winning the election. Harris is now down to 44 point six percent. I want to be clear. This is still anyone's race. But if the Trump momentum holds and he wins the presidency a week from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=11.28s)]
*  tomorrow there are four events that I believe will be remembered as pivotal. First the V.P. debate or Vance Trout's walls. You yourself just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And Governor Walz you blame Donald Trump. Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years. And the answer is you're running mate not mine. Second Trump's return to Butler. A very big thank you to Pennsylvania. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=29.88s)]
*  We love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying. Third Trump working at McDonald's. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=60.24s)]
*  You can type. You got the salt on it. Never touches the human hand. I made it myself. I have worked. I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala requires great expertise. And fourth the capper the PAC show at Madison Square Garden. For the past nine years we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on Earth. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=73.68s)]
*  With your vote in this election you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. It belongs to you. Well I was there and the message was hopeful optimistic and Reaganesque. Thousands and thousands waited in line for 12 hours to get in. The crowd was patriotic. It was happy diverse young old independents Republicans of course different races and ethnicity. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=101.88s)]
*  They shared a faith that Donald Trump can deliver on bringing a new golden age to the country they all love. We will have the strongest economy the most secure borders the safest cities the most powerful military. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=132.84s)]
*  The best trade deals and we will dominate the frontiers of science medicine business technology and space. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  And I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=156.16s)]
*  I'm asking you to dream big again. This will be America's new golden age. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=165.16s)]
*  I love that line. The new golden age. Yes we need that in America. Now I've been covering these types of rallies since 2015 and the coalition has grown. The people that the MAGA movement gained along the way. These are significant people and it tells us a lot about why this matters why it's working. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=172.04s)]
*  R.F.K. Junior Tulsi Gabbard Elon Musk Vivek Ramaswamy and countless regular folks who have given Trump's pragmatic populism another look because they all came to see what we've known for years that the old Washington establishment has failed us in every way. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=193.04s)]
*  It's failed us at home. It's failed us abroad in politics and the culture. But voters are recognizing that just because they failed it doesn't mean America has to fail because America can be renewed. We're for everyone. If you're an American we're building the biggest [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=212.88s)]
*  Broadest most diverse coalition in American history including union workers and border patrol agents. We're seeing historic levels of support among our black population Hispanic population and our Asian population Jews and Muslims and Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  They're all joining our cause and large numbers larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before. And the Republican Party has really become the party of inclusion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  The party of inclusion. Take their language recapture it as your own because that's the truth. They're exclusionary. They're intolerant. We want everyone to be better stronger more prosperous and safer. It doesn't matter where you came from doesn't matter what color your skin is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=265.84s)]
*  That's what we believe. So the atmosphere in that arena was electric. It was on fire and it was overwhelmingly optimistic. I kept thinking I was watching what other politician in America could gather such a crowd. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Madison Square Garden was packed. People waited hours to get in. They sat through hour after hour of this rally. They were fervent in their devotion to all things Trump. Trump has created a movement. There is [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=299.88s)]
*  no doubt I cannot think of another Republican figure of my lifetime who could have come into a Democratic city like New York and put together anything like that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=312.68s)]
*  OK. They've been trashing him all day for saying that. That's true. That's obvious. Everyone is honest today would be saying the same thing. There is no one else who could have done it. They wouldn't even try to do it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=322.56s)]
*  And the night was a celebration of American freedom probably above all else. But there of course there are others who truly believe that you can't be a good person or a moral person if you believe that we need to take care of American needs and American problems first. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=334.52s)]
*  This is called normalization. Yes. This is the descent into fascism if we so choose. I come with such dire warnings and I mean them from the bottom of my heart as a daughter of refugees who came here escaping war. It was everything that you need to know about Donald Trump in one weird white nationalist Nazi type rally. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=352.48s)]
*  And of course there's historic parallels to where and when this happened. I love the Nazi stuff. There's so many Jewish Americans there Jewish flags there. There were Muslims there. I don't know what she's watching or what she watching because the parallels to last night and I wrote about this on Fox News dot com. You could check it out there. I'll also post it later. JFK's rally there in 1962 or FDR's reelection rally in 1936 exactly 88 years ago on Thursday. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=380.16s)]
*  Look no one with a brain who's really being honest with themselves believes that Donald Trump or his supporters are fascists. And frankly when you're playing that card you have no vision. You have no record and you have no plan to make America better for working people. You're just out of gas and you're out of ideas. All you have are lies and smears. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=410.16s)]
*  And the woman with truly zero principles who's claimed all along. Oh I'm going to fight for working people. I used to 10 bar. Remember that. But sold out to billionaires back in Harris. She's also out of ideas. This was a hate rally. They are inciting violence and hatred against Latinos against black Americans against Americans who don't have children. The only reason that the rhetoric has gotten this far is precisely because they are trying to prime the kind of froth that led up to the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=433.72s)]
*  January 6th attack on the Capitol. Oh my God. Stuck on stupid stuck on January 6. That's the banner. Now how aggressively inane these people sound. Again they have essentially given up on the American people. They've given up on our ideals and much of our tradition. They think it's wicked and evil. But Trump has not. He believes we should dream big. You deserve to dream big. You work hard. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=463.72s)]
*  You want your kids to do well. And this is of course that quintessentially American impulse. It's also classic New York. No city embodies the spirit energy and potential of the American people more than where we are gathered tonight. We want to win our country but we also want to win New York and make it safe and strong and beautiful and affordable and vibrant again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  I love that. Put that on a hat. Make New York vibrant again. How about not smell like pot either. Trump is just unabashedly pro-American. It's infectious and his supporters are pro-American too. And this drives the Democrats absolutely insane. Remember these same people are triggered by too much flag flying. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=521.56s)]
*  After years of running our country into the ground their only response to being called out for their lazy leadership their lousy record is Nazis and fascists. That's all they got. What pathetic and sad people they are. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=541.36s)]
*  Now remember there is one supremely powerful dictatorship in the world today. It really threatens us and it's a CCP. So who do you think China hopes wins next week. Not Trump because he kept them back on their heels. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  And they didn't like that at all. But they'd love a bumbler like Kamala and her new warmonger pal Liz Cheney because perpetual war means a weaker America. Guaranteed that's good for dictatorships. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=570.48s)]
*  I think more than anything when I looked around that arena last night and talked to the people there the firefighters and the police and just regular people from Connecticut or New Jersey New York. Some people came from further away some from [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=585.16s)]
*  Manhattan. I think Americans just want a return to common sense. They want logic. They want clear solutions to obvious problems like we're out of money. We're thirty five trillion dollars in debt. The government. Yeah. Has to be reined in. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=596.28s)]
*  All government spending is taxation. So whether it's direct taxation or all government spending it's either it becomes inflation or it's a direct taxation. Your money is being wasted. And the Department of Government [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=612.72s)]
*  efficiency is going to fix that. We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook. Music to the ears of millions of Americans. A Department of Government efficiency. I love it. Now if families have to live on a budget. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=624.36s)]
*  Why doesn't the government have to live on a budget. It kind of makes sense when you think about it. But compare the big thinking of Trump Vance and people like Musk to the small thinking of the man who ushered in near record inflation and a migrant invasion. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=646.56s)]
*  It's simply embarrassing. It's beneath any president. But that's what we're getting used to. That's why this election is so important. You know most of the presidential scholars I've spoken to talk about the single most consequential thing about a president's character. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=661.52s)]
*  He puts that in question every time he opens. All right. Because Biden is a good one to talk about character. A man who helped his son make millions off his position and influence from a communist regime and a president whose open borders resulted in needless American [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=682.88s)]
*  death and suffering. Forget that hundreds of billions of dollars were out because of it. On November 5th eight days from right now this long campaign will finally end. So each of us must choose whether to join the hopeful and the optimistic movement that rallied in New York last night or whether to support the cynics and the liars who've given up on this country. If we make the right choice. Yeah we can save America. And that's the angle. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=702.4s)]
*  Your love keeps me going. Happy Monday everyone. Donald Trump clapping for the day. They can't hear you. So Donald Trump held his rally last night at Madison Square Garden. Why on a Sunday. Well unlike Democrats they had to go to work on Monday. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=732.4s)]
*  MSNBC is getting called out for splicing in Nazi images to video of Sunday's Trump rally. They were also criticized for using clips from The Joker. But that turned out to be an unedited Kamala interview. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=755.6400000000001s)]
*  Comedian Tony Hinscliffe is under fire for joking that Puerto Rico is a floating island of garbage upsetting New Yorkers who said I thought we were the floating island of garbage. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=768.52s)]
*  Yeah. Get in line. Puerto Rico. Trump said if he's reelected he'll cover the cost of his administration's transition. Kamala responded saying if he hires Venezuelan gang members will also cover their transition. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=784.76s)]
*  In an appeal to young men AOC and Tim Walz played Madden football online this weekend. They would have played Call of Duty but Walz kept trying to run. At one point. At one point their stream had fewer than 10,000 viewers. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=801.2s)]
*  Hell my stream beats that and that's when I write my name in the snow. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=821.08s)]
*  A group supporting Kamala Harris released a bizarre ad showing a young man pleasuring himself while watching porn on his phone. Well at least they finally found some guys who were pulling for Kamala. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=829.24s)]
*  Finally a new study suggests that very masculine men are at a higher risk for having heart problems. They say the most masculine. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=840.32s)]
*  Men. Thank you. No acting classes. All right. So Trump is by most accounts leading in the polls suddenly Hispanics are calling voting Republican mucho caliente which in English translates to very hot or Greg Gutfeld. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=855.72s)]
*  The Jewish vote may go more Republican than any time since Ronald Reagan which is weird since Trump is Hitler. African-Americans are excited to vote for Trump and not just this one. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=883.04s)]
*  And a series of so-called conservatives have either been relegated to the nuthouse or revealed themselves as self-centered phonies. Exhibit A the Washington Post conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin Rubin's a longtime WAPO columnist who's claimed to be conservative for years. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=894.68s)]
*  But even for years before she was anything but as a labor lawyer for decades she was described as straight ahead Hollywood lib. Still with great fanfare the post welcomed her aboard as their token righty a female conservative. It was like finding a BLM member who's into Dave Matthews. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=917.84s)]
*  So here's this post vaunted conservative speaking on MSNBC. The person who is incoherent and unable to string together a sentence is not President Biden. It's former President Trump. We have an entire political party that is devoted to a criminal defendant someone who tried to overthrow our democracy. We have a party that has betrayed America. I think it's malpractice for the journalistic media. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=936.08s)]
*  Troops not to begin asking questions about Trump's sanity his mental and emotional status. He sounds nuts. Yeah she's a conservative and I'm Lizzo's late night booty call. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  Could be. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=982.5200000000001s)]
*  Once again the Donald Trump effect has exposed another lying fraud. Last week Rubin took to her ex account to support L.A. Times editorial board members who resigned because that paper wouldn't endorse Kamala. Bravo Rubin writes in response to one woman quitting. That is courage and shame on her boss for not joining her. Bravo all respect she says to another and then added. Where are the rest of them. Now apparently self-righteousness is a [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=982.92s)]
*  self-awareness is not Rubin strong point because literally as Rubin was writing that her own paper was also refusing to endorse Kamala while she was while the still signing Rubin's paychecks which clearly she doesn't spend on hair and makeup. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1012.92s)]
*  But maybe she doesn't even read that rag the one that she works and writes for. So now both the editorial board and its union members at WAPO revolted. But what of the revolting Rubin who shamed L.A. Times writers for not quitting. Where is her own resignation letter. You googly eyed snaggle face. Or does playing fake conservative pay too well. But hey if you resigned I'm sure there's room for more. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1029.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's room for you at the Oatsville trough at the view. But we know she won't. This woman is about as authentic as the meat at Arby's. But it's not just about Rubin who in truth really doesn't matter. Fact is Trump is forcing all these people into showing who they really are. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1059.2s)]
*  From fakes like Rubin to Democrat operatives at the L.A. Times and the Washington Post posing as journalists. It's like Trump flipped on the light in the kitchen at 2 in the morning and all these cockroaches went scurrying every which way. Although over at CNN Captain Pop and Fresh pulls out a new pulls out a new phrase. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1078.8s)]
*  The overarching story here is about a concern that billionaires like Bezos might be rolling over and appeasing Donald Trump. But even before the election day actually rolls around. This is known by some scholars as anticipatory obedience. The idea that some people obey in advance to curry favor with aspiring authoritarians. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1098.8s)]
*  Somebody has Wikipedia anticipatory obedience sounds like Stelter when he finds a Big Mac on the street. Trump you see is like political truth serum. All those people who spent years saying their journalism is purely objective now come out enraged that their office didn't pick a side. But while all this nonsense is going on Trump was working harder than Joy Behar's flea and tick collar. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L375euJFRE&t=1121.4s)]
*  Did a three hour interview with Rogan on Friday. Just imagine either Joe or Kamala doing that. Hey Sean Hannity here.
