# Fox News Highlights - Feb. 18, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ)
*  Europe's wake-up call, that's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm looking at people that are being killed, and they're Russian and Ukrainian people, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=7.68s)]
*  but they're people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=12.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter where they're from on the whole planet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=13.24s)]
*  And I think I have the power to end this war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And living up to his promise, President Trump sent his diplomatic team to Riyadh, Saudi [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=20.16s)]
*  Arabia to meet with a Russian delegation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=24.18s)]
*  Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=27.84s)]
*  And President Trump is committed to bringing an end to this conflict. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=31.64s)]
*  He wants it to end in a way that's fair. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  He wants it to end in a way that's sustainable and enduring, not that leads to another conflict [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=36.32s)]
*  in two to three years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Now ending this bloodshed, the killing, in a war that had reached a stalemate long ago, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  that certainly sounds reasonable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=48.72s)]
*  And we know it's what Americans want. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=50.8s)]
*  It's part of the reason they voted for Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=52.24s)]
*  But from the cheerleaders of endless wars, the response was predictable. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=54.76s)]
*  As a series of Trump administration officials essentially trying to bully Ukraine into giving [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  up lots of its natural resources. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=66.22s)]
*  Ukrainians are very nervous. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=69.0s)]
*  They are potentially being set up to be carved up between Presidents Trump and President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=70.36s)]
*  Putin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=77.0s)]
*  By the way, this is why we need Elbridge Colby in there at the Pentagon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=78.24s)]
*  He's bolstered the America first MAGA agenda. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=81.88s)]
*  I understand there's some people in the Senate who might be giving him a hard time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=85.92s)]
*  He's fantastic and totally on board with what Trump wants to do in Ukraine, vis-a-vis China [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  and all around the world. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=96.92s)]
*  But everyone's still holding on to this war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  They've lost touch with reality. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Some, by the way, were literally reduced to tears after Vance delivered his blunt message. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=102.32s)]
*  After the speech of Vice President Vance on Friday, we have to fear that our common [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=109.48s)]
*  value base is not that common anymore. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  Let me conclude and this becomes difficult. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=118.72s)]
*  Only the Europeans would clap for tears. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=135.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=138.04s)]
*  The globalist chorus was horrified that an American Vice President actually traveled [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=138.54s)]
*  to Europe and represented American interests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=143.44s)]
*  Lecturing them about democracy, the time when there are so many questions about democratic [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=147.56s)]
*  values being observed and upheld in the United States, it seemed particularly inappropriate. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=153.72s)]
*  Totally appropriate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=161.2s)]
*  The American people do not have a permanent obligation to protect Europe no matter what. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=162.32s)]
*  As though Europe's some beloved elderly relative and it's our job to pay for the cost of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=168.6s)]
*  nursing home. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=173.16s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=174.16s)]
*  Now, let's just understand what we're talking about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=175.16s)]
*  The European Union has a population of around 450 million people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=178.34s)]
*  We're about 350. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Its GDP is around 17 trillion euros. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=186.2s)]
*  Last year, the EU's trade surplus and goods with the US was a staggering $235 billion. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=190.32s)]
*  And you might not know this, but EU companies own $2.4 trillion worth of assets in this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=197.76s)]
*  country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=204.0s)]
*  And as the UK learned when it tried to leave the EU, the Europeans can play hardball and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=205.0s)]
*  negotiate when they want to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=208.88s)]
*  So the notion that they're unable to defend themselves in a dangerous world or that they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=211.44s)]
*  the support of the United States, it is ridiculous. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=217.16s)]
*  And there's another point, one that Vice President Vance made very well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=221.64s)]
*  The Europeans for the most part do not share our values. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=225.92s)]
*  Americans overwhelmingly, well, we believe in free speech, not the Europeans. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=230.12s)]
*  We were with state police as they raided this apartment in northwest Germany. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=235.84s)]
*  In the morning, six armed officers searched a suspect's home, then seized his laptop [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=243.64s)]
*  and cell phone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=248.88s)]
*  Those electronics may have been used to commit a crime, the crime posting a racist cartoon [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=250.16s)]
*  online. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=257.08s)]
*  At the exact same time across Germany, more than 50 similar raids played out. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=258.08s)]
*  Now Europeans believe that governments should be able to restrain speech. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=266.8s)]
*  Free speech is the type you have to protect if you believe in free speech, but speech [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=271.76s)]
*  that they consider harmful. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=275.8s)]
*  We're going to dive more into this later on in the show. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=277.36s)]
*  And Americans, by the way, overwhelmingly believe that voters should have a major say [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=281.24s)]
*  in policymaking, but the Europeans are comfortable with systems that exclude certain parties [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  from the policymaking process, no matter how many votes they get. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Americans believe in the right to bear arms, that it's sacrosanct in fact, not Europeans. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=294.2s)]
*  And we worry about the economic risks of terrible climate policies, but the Europeans, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=300.28s)]
*  well, they'll embrace those policies even if it drives them into economic ruin. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  Now we have major interests in Asia and are extremely worried, we Americans, about the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=310.4s)]
*  rise of China. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=316.9s)]
*  Europeans, they're not worried. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=318.4s)]
*  They overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump and his stance vis-a-vis China. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=320.88s)]
*  But Americans, we're giving him all-time record-high approval ratings. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=327.92s)]
*  Now none of this means that we should completely ignore Europe or that we're destined to have [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=333.56s)]
*  serious conflicts with the Europeans. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Our differences, by the way, are not new. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=340.88s)]
*  The Europeans haven't liked any Republican, I don't think since Eisenhower. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=343.36s)]
*  Remember the wave of no-nukes anti-Reagan protests in Germany in the 80s? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=348.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  But of course the Europeans gave Barack Obama the Nobel Peace Prize, mainly because he wasn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=354.36s)]
*  President George W. Bush. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=360.36s)]
*  And of course that's their right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=362.32s)]
*  But we won our independence from a European country almost 250 years ago and we're not [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=364.6s)]
*  going to give it up anytime soon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=369.92s)]
*  So here's how this is going to go down. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  We're going to fix things here at home. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=374.12s)]
*  As part of that effort, we're going to be cutting expenditures in Europe and that's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  okay. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  We're going to have to cut a lot of federal spending to begin turning things around. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=382.4s)]
*  And the Europeans will be fine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  They've defended themselves for thousands of years and they haven't forgotten how. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=389.4s)]
*  And sometimes we'll agree with Europe. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes we won't and that's okay too. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=397.08s)]
*  For 30 years a lot of people in D.C. pretended that there was such a thing as an international [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=399.76s)]
*  world order, that we're all part of it, living in harmony together. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=406.64s)]
*  But they were wrong. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=410.72s)]
*  The world is now and always has been a dangerous place where people who want to be free must [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  have the willingness and the ability to defend that freedom. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=419.2s)]
*  And finally we have a president now who understands that reality, yay, and who's going to look [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=424.0s)]
*  out for our interests. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=428.22s)]
*  That makes Europe very nervous. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=429.22s)]
*  Instead, we used to have a president who just does what everyone else wanted. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  But Europe will get used to this new world order and will all be better off as a result. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=435.4s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't believe Trump when he says Doge is finding fraud. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  They say he doesn't have any evidence. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=445.58s)]
*  Well today the president brought receipts. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=447.32s)]
*  $520 million for a consultant on the environment. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=450.56s)]
*  $25 million to promote biodiversity conservation and promote licit livelihoods by developing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=458.28s)]
*  socially responsible behavior in the country of Colombia. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=465.88s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=469.84s)]

*  Up in Boston, there was a lot of singing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=945.42s)]

*  But if you think all they have is drag queens and cowbells, you're wrong. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=968.34s)]
*  They're planning a protest outside of Tesla dealerships. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=972.14s)]
*  And if they already own a Tesla, they're slapping on anti-Elon bumper stickers. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=976.1s)]
*  Look at this one. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=981.3s)]
*  Elon says they're crazy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=985.58s)]
*  They call it like Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=987.58s)]
*  And you don't realize how real this is until like it's, you can't reason with people. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=990.58s)]
*  So like I was at a friend's birthday party, just a birthday dinner, and it was like a [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=995.66s)]

*  And I happened to mention, this is before the election, like a month or two before, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1003.3399999999999s)]
*  I happened to mention the president's name. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1006.06s)]
*  And it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained like methamphetamine [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1008.14s)]
*  and rabies. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1012.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1013.42s)]

*  And I'm like, what is wrong? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1015.42s)]

*  And you can see more of that at nine. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1024.06s)]
*  Elon's nerd army is just there to upgrade antiquated computers, audit the books, and [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1026.06s)]
*  save taxpayer cash. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1030.46s)]
*  And they're calling it treason. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1032.42s)]
*  Big balls is a threat to bureaucracy, not democracy. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1034.22s)]
*  DC voted for Kamala 90%. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1037.42s)]
*  And inside all these agencies, Democrats overwhelm Republicans. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1040.8200000000002s)]
*  Just at the State Department, 74% Democrat, 18% Republican. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1045.1000000000001s)]

*  Democrats outnumber Republicans by double digits in every agency. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1056.74s)]
*  And all of these bureaucracies are unionized and kick over millions in donations to Democrats [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1059.46s)]
*  every cycle. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1066.02s)]
*  So Democrats win elections and they grow the government and the government donates more [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1067.02s)]
*  to Democrats and gives them all your money. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1071.3000000000002s)]

*  That's why they're kicking and screaming when DOJ opens the door. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1079.46s)]
*  They think it's their government. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1083.14s)]
*  Doesn't matter if Trump's president, it's their government. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1085.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it belongs to taxpayers. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1088.22s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1090.22s)]
*  It belongs to them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1091.22s)]
*  And the country's had enough. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1092.22s)]
*  Here's the CEO of Palantir. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1094.22s)]
*  Watch. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1096.22s)]
*  I just view this as, well, let's watch the Democratic Party commit suicide. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1097.22s)]
*  And, like, I've been a Democrat most of my life. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1101.22s)]
*  And what I see is most of the country doesn't really, at this point, given the fraud, waste, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1104.22s)]
*  and abuse we know is there, 90% of the country's like, get rid of that fraud, waste, and abuse. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1110.22s)]
*  And I just view this as yet another example of the progressive left boxing themselves [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1115.6200000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1129.6200000000001s)]
*  So why is it that we do not know where every penny of our money goes? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1130.6200000000001s)]
*  Like, how do you explain that to people? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1135.6200000000001s)]
*  The right response is, we want this to happen, we want to happen, we want to be involved [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1137.6200000000001s)]

*  And the right response is, it feels like the people criticizing Elon don't want it to happen. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1143.02s)]
*  And this is going to destroy those people. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1148.02s)]
*  What hurts vampires? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1151.02s)]
*  Sunlight. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1153.02s)]
*  Doja's sunlight. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1155.02s)]

*  What never lies, besides George Washington? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1161.02s)]
*  Math. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1165.02s)]

*  No matter how much Democrats argue with it and lie about it, math doesn't care. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1172.42s)]
*  It keeps computing. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1175.42s)]
*  How do you solve a crime? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1177.42s)]
*  Follow the money. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1179.42s)]
*  That's what Doja's doing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1181.42s)]
*  Following the money. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1183.42s)]
*  And it's leading to the crime scene. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1185.42s)]
*  And Democrats, like the sickos they are, have gone back to the scene of the crime. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1187.42s)]
*  And are trying to get into the building. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1191.42s)]

*  And now they get it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1198.42s)]
*  These men and women are risking it all to advance American technology. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1200.8200000000002s)]

*  I think the West, as a notion and as a principle upon which it is exe- is exe- again, is obviously superior. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1219.8200000000002s)]

*  Trump, Musk, big balls, took AI and flipped it on Democrats. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1294.02s)]

*  But what about democracy? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1376.22s)]
*  The thing hyperventilating Democrats keep saying he's going to destroy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1378.22s)]
*  Even then, 38% trust him a lot and 17% trust him a little. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1381.22s)]
*  That's 55%, Kat. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1386.22s)]
*  I'm singling you out for no reason at all. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1389.22s)]
*  Thank you for admitting that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1392.22s)]
*  From a Biden perspective, most Americans couldn't even trust Joe Biden to put his shoes on the right feet. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  Now keep in mind, these people who trust Trump aren't starry-eyed fans. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  Take this panel of CNN voters who supported Biden in 2020. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1404.6200000000001s)]
*  Who, much to CNN's chagrin, love what Trump's doing. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1409.6200000000001s)]
*  Our friends at Engageus talked to some Arizona voters who switched from voting for Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1413.6200000000001s)]
*  And so far, they mostly like what they see. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1422.02s)]
*  I just think he's trying to get America back on track as quickly as possible. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1426.02s)]
*  It feels more merit and transparency than I'm getting from the administration so far. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1430.02s)]
*  I approve of a lot of the stuff that he's doing with the border and everything. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1435.02s)]
*  But in most part, I feel like he's on the right track. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1438.02s)]
*  All 11 Biden-Trump voters say they approve of Donald Trump's first weeks in office. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1442.02s)]
*  Mmm, poor Dana having to spit those words out. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1447.42s)]
*  I haven't seen someone regret their words so deeply since Abe Lincoln said, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1452.42s)]
*  Is this seat taken? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1456.42s)]
*  Too soon? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1463.42s)]
*  Yeah, too soon. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1464.42s)]
*  He's got a great, great grand-cousin who's upset. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1466.42s)]
*  Write your letters. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1471.42s)]
*  But it sucks for Dana Bash because none of those voters are typical Trumpers. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1472.8200000000002s)]
*  You never catch those voters in a MAGA hat. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1476.8200000000002s)]
*  They've probably never even been to a NASCAR race. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1479.8200000000002s)]
*  Neither have I, but that's only because Danica Patrick took out that restraining order. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1482.8200000000002s)]
*  The shock over at CNN continues. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1488.8200000000002s)]
*  Listen to the anchors' reaction when Frank Luntz tells her that former Hillary supporters like what Trump is doing. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1490.8200000000002s)]
*  You've been speaking with a number of voters who were Hillary Clinton 2016, Joe Biden 2020, and then went for Trump in 2024. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1497.22s)]
*  How are these folks seeing the early days of Trump's second term? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1507.22s)]
*  Pretty well. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1511.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1512.22s)]
*  And they're reacting to it because they love the pace of change. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1513.22s)]
*  They were very fed up over the last four years. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1516.22s)]
*  They wanted action. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1519.22s)]
*  They wanted results. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1520.22s)]
*  They looked at prices. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1521.22s)]
*  They looked at affordability. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1522.22s)]
*  They looked at immigration. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1523.22s)]
*  And they didn't see anything happening. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1525.6200000000001s)]
*  They still don't like what he says, but they like what he does. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1527.6200000000001s)]
*  Someone call animal control. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1532.6200000000001s)]
*  Get that thing on Frank's head neutered. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1537.6200000000001s)]
*  We can't let it reproduce. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1540.6200000000001s)]
*  But you heard what Frank said, right? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1543.6200000000001s)]
*  Quote, they don't like what he says, but they like what he does. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1545.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's cue the callback. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1548.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump's sound is blunt, raw, to some, scary, but his deeds are primarily in the service of the country. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1551.02s)]
*  If you don't like his words, just follow his deeds, because those are music to my ears. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1559.02s)]
*  So what if he tweets and there's always this kind of underlying chaos and conflict? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1565.02s)]
*  If somebody is right on the big picture, it doesn't matter. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1570.02s)]
*  If you have problems with Trump's character or his jokes or the way he acts, concentrate on what he does. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1574.42s)]
*  My face is like that little rubber stress ball. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1583.42s)]
*  But it's like I'm Nostradamus with six-pack abs. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1593.42s)]
*  And that YouGov poll backs it up. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1597.42s)]
*  Despite some people not liking Trump, they trust him to do what's right. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1599.42s)]
*  Which is fine, because he's your president, not somebody you're trying to f*** on Tinder. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1602.8200000000002s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1608.8200000000002s)]
*  Because it's all about deeds, not words. Trump recognized it, too. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1610.8200000000002s)]
*  I think Tucker Carlson and Laura and Jesse Waters and Janine, we have a lot of great people. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1616.8200000000002s)]
*  Even Greg Gutfeld. He wasn't good to me two years ago, now he sees all I've done. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1623.8200000000002s)]
*  He said, would you rather have a great president or a nice guy? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1627.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't know, I think I'm a nice guy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1632.22s)]
*  Just reminds me of Joe Pesci when he does that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1643.22s)]
*  But that's another thing I like about him, he has great taste in pundits. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1647.22s)]
*  So as the Democrats steered their party off a cliff, they're still screaming fascist all the way down. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1650.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, most voters shrug it off, for they're able to separate whatever personal feelings about Trump [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1655.22s)]
*  from their recognition of the things he's getting done. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1660.6200000000001s)]
*  Sure, maybe you think he's a jerk, but a lot of people feel that way about your husband, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1663.6200000000001s)]
*  and yet you're still happy to spend the money he makes on that stupid s*** like candles and decorative bowls. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1666.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, don't put your keys in the bowl, it's for decoration. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1672.6200000000001s)]
*  And maybe you even think that about me, that I'm a jerk. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1678.6200000000001s)]
*  I suppose anything's possible. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1681.6200000000001s)]
*  But that's your right as an American. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1684.6200000000001s)]
*  Unless you're an illegal, in which case, clean my pool and then get out of here before Tom Homan shows up. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1687.02s)]
*  But now that Trump is actually following up on his campaign promises, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1696.02s)]
*  a lot of people are deciding they don't care about his personal flaws, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1699.02s)]
*  they're willing to accept the whole package, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1702.02s)]
*  because he's undoing much of the damage the Dems have caused. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1704.02s)]
*  He's like a bull in a china shop, except in reverse. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1707.02s)]
*  He's putting the pieces back together, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1711.02s)]
*  and unlike Kamala and the Democrats, he's not sniffing the glue. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1713.02s)]
*  Look, you don't need to worship Trump to support him, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1716.42s)]
*  you don't even need to like him to like what he does. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1718.42s)]
*  Because that doesn't make you a Republican, it just makes you an adult. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1721.42s)]
*  Let's hear it! [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1726.42s)]
*  Welcome to tonight's guest! [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1727.42s)]
*  He'll risk his career to speak without fear! [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1729.42s)]

*  Whoever thinks life is short has never seen his act. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1739.42s)]
*  Actor, writer and comedian, Jamie Lissa! [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1743.42s)]
*  This guy used to pack heat, now his opinions can't be beat. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1746.42s)]
*  Fox News contributor, Paul Morrow! [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1750.42s)]

*  New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Zipf! [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1759.42s)]
*  Zach, welcome to the show. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1767.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1769.42s)]
*  You look great. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1770.42s)]
*  Thanks, I'm trying. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1771.42s)]
*  No, you don't have to try. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1772.42s)]
*  That's what I hate about you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1773.42s)]
*  You come from an industry where this has to be like a bombshell every day, right? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1775.8200000000002s)]
*  Trump's doing something, doing something, doing something. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1779.8200000000002s)]
*  And you just remain calm. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1781.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, do you ever try to explain Trump's appeal to people who still can't handle it? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1784.8200000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1789.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I try to engage in good, profitable conversation all the time. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1790.8200000000002s)]
*  I try to do that in real life. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1792.8200000000002s)]
*  I try to do that with friends and family. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1794.8200000000002s)]
*  I try to do that on social media. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1796.8200000000002s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  Social media is a very interesting and quite often toxic place. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1800.8200000000002s)]
*  But I still attempt to lead with love and talk to people about their concerns. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1804.22s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1809.22s)]
*  We have to have empathy with people. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1810.22s)]
*  I think right now we're applying a tremendous amount of logic and reason to a big problem [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1811.22s)]
*  and all of the darkness and the corruption and everything that's been going on for far too long. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1816.22s)]
*  We must try to balance that with some empathy along the way and see that there are people, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1820.22s)]
*  people that voted differently than us, but they are still human beings and children of God [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1824.22s)]
*  and we must love them and we must all try to move forward in that as much as we can. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1828.22s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1832.6200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1834.6200000000001s)]
*  Hold your applause for my response. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1836.6200000000001s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1838.6200000000001s)]
*  The problem is I think the people that we're talking about would listen to you. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1840.6200000000001s)]
*  Or a lot of them are because they're still pissed off. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1843.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1846.6200000000001s)]
*  But again, I can't, I can't, none of us can control anybody else's emotions [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  or their triggers to certain things and we should never try. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1851.6200000000001s)]
*  But to the extent that we can at least hold our ground firmly, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1855.6200000000001s)]
*  but again, in a kindness and an understanding. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1859.02s)]
*  Like I think it's, I think it's folly when we see other people reacting [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1862.02s)]
*  and being snotty and **** and jaded and whatever it is. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1866.02s)]
*  If we allow that to then inform how we react to them, we're losing in the same game. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1870.02s)]
*  You know, you try, you try. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1875.02s)]
*  There goes my show if I ever did that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1877.02s)]
*  You know, Jamie, we're talking about words versus deeds. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1879.02s)]
*  Unfortunately for you, your words are terrible and you've done nothing productive in your life. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1883.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1887.42s)]
*  I've also never felt less good looking than since you sat me next to Zach. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1889.42s)]
*  Isn't it weird how New York has a different standard of handsomeness than like LA? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1895.42s)]
*  It's like you're pretty good looking for New York, but now you're like a three. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1900.42s)]
*  Dude, I was on a Carnival Cruise ship a couple weeks ago, I was like an eight. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1906.42s)]
*  Now this. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1912.42s)]
*  You're a ten to me, bro. You're a ten to me. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1913.42s)]
*  But yeah, I think people are just saying that Trump actually does what he says he's going to do with the Biden administration. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1917.42s)]
*  I haven't seen less follow through since my wedding vows. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1923.42s)]
*  I should have known something was going to go wrong during my wedding. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1929.42s)]
*  I was thinking back on it the other day. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1932.42s)]
*  I remember her going, I'll be with you for good times and that's it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1933.42s)]
*  But good for Trump. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1943.42s)]
*  I think this is all very exciting. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1944.42s)]
*  I think it's good that America's, they're not stupid. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1946.8200000000002s)]
*  They're watching good things happen and he's actually coming. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1948.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, look at Biden's, at the end of Biden's presidency, I looked it up. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1952.8200000000002s)]
*  His approval rating was down to friends and family. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1955.8200000000002s)]
*  And then I also heard from a pretty good source that if a friend or something would come up to him [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1958.8200000000002s)]
*  and interrupt him and go, pardon me, he would go, okay, sure. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1963.8200000000002s)]
*  Paul, do you remember sometime in like 2015 at the West Side Steakhouse [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1967.22s)]
*  when you were trying to convince me to vote for Trump [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1974.22s)]
*  and I stood up and I left the bar angry. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1977.22s)]
*  We were outside and I walked off down 10th Avenue. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1980.22s)]
*  I was that emotional type. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1986.22s)]
*  You were an asshole. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1989.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1990.22s)]
*  I was an asshole. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1991.6200000000001s)]
*  True, I was. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1992.6200000000001s)]
*  Emotional asshole. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1993.6200000000001s)]
*  You came around. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1994.6200000000001s)]
*  Look, what could be more delicious than watching the lefty media [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1995.6200000000001s)]
*  have to spit out the fact, it's like watching your ex do a lot better than you're doing, right? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  Wow, you married a billionaire. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2005.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, and I'm sitting, I'm working at McDonald's. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2007.6200000000001s)]
*  They can't believe it's going away. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2009.6200000000001s)]
*  And the reason is, and Jamie Hinnard, you know, I'm a big fan of your show. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2011.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm a big fan of your show. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2015.6200000000001s)]
*  You're like, oh, I'm a big fan of your show. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2018.02s)]
*  And I can't believe it's going away. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2020.02s)]
*  And the reason is, and Jamie Hinnard, you know, it's, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2022.02s)]
*  there's no zeal like a convert, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2025.02s)]
*  And they're not used to the fact that, okay, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2027.02s)]
*  they signed on with this guy and he's doing it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2029.02s)]
*  Like he's doing what he said he was going to, like, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2033.02s)]
*  when do you see that in politics, right? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2035.02s)]
*  The guy says, I'm going to do A, B, C, D. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2036.02s)]
*  Before his ass hits the seat, he's doing it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2038.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2040.02s)]
*  And, you know, look, there's going to be some downsides. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2041.02s)]
*  You know, it's like when you go on a new website, right? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2043.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2045.02s)]
*  Do you accept the cookies? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2046.02s)]
*  And you just, and they're seeing some of that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2047.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2048.9s)]
*  But the bottom line is, he's doing what he said [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2049.74s)]
*  he was gonna do. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2051.78s)]
*  And so, I don't know that they're gonna get, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2052.62s)]
*  it's 52% of the population on the election day. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2054.62s)]
*  Right now, what, he's in 60s on these issues? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2059.2s)]
*  I don't know that they come back. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2062.02s)]
*  So you and I have talked about this. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2063.66s)]
*  They're in real trouble here, because he's really winning. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2065.66s)]
*  I mean, everything he promised in the first term, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2068.3s)]
*  it's really coming to fruition. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2071.06s)]
*  They don't know what the hell to do. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2072.82s)]
*  And so as a result, they yell. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2073.74s)]
*  And that's not really convincing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2076.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2077.82s)]
*  Kat, I think it's safe to say that your baby [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2078.6600000000003s)]
*  has an opinion by now. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2080.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2082.5s)]
*  This baby votes. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2085.34s)]
*  See, the baby's been on so many shows. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2086.2200000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2088.5s)]
*  What do you think the baby, how the baby views this? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  Where does the baby stand on Trump? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2093.38s)]
*  I don't know, I think the baby just really likes me. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2095.98s)]
*  And then I think it wants to come out. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2099.0200000000004s)]
*  And then it hears you talk, and it's like, ah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2100.7000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2106.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2107.1000000000004s)]
*  So the baby agrees with me. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2109.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2110.6200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I hesitate to talk about the baby, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2112.2200000000003s)]
*  because then I get like the, man, some of the stuff [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2114.0200000000004s)]
*  people feel comfortable saying to you when you're pregnant [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2116.2200000000003s)]
*  is wild. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2118.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2118.98s)]
*  I had someone email me seven times about my amniotic fluid. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  And then they were like, why aren't you replying? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2122.86s)]
*  Why are you replying? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2124.82s)]
*  Because information about any of my fluids [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2125.6600000000003s)]
*  are on a basis where I'll tell you first [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2127.7400000000002s)]
*  if I want you to know. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2129.5s)]
*  You're supposed to change it every six months. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2130.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2132.7400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2133.7000000000003s)]
*  They acted like I didn't know that. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2134.22s)]
*  I'm going to get emails about that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2139.18s)]
*  So I can steer this in a direction [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2140.7s)]
*  that will save us both. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2143.62s)]
*  I think that it was the understatement that I've [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2147.2999999999997s)]
*  heard recently at all, none bigger [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2150.3399999999997s)]
*  than the person they had on CNN that said [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2153.8999999999996s)]
*  that he's more transparent than what happened before. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2156.8199999999997s)]
*  Because Trump is maybe a little too transparent sometimes. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2160.2599999999998s)]
*  That's what can get him in trouble. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2163.94s)]
*  I think he says things before he's really [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2165.6200000000003s)]
*  sure if he thinks it or not. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2168.0600000000004s)]
*  He's kind of like just a test drive, this idea. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2169.7000000000003s)]
*  As opposed to the other guy that we just [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2172.54s)]
*  weren't allowed to hear talk. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2174.6200000000003s)]
*  Because that's ultimately what happened to Biden's candidacy [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2176.6600000000003s)]
*  is that too many people heard him talk. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2179.3s)]
*  Because nobody who watches Fox was shocked [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2182.1000000000004s)]
*  to see what happened at the debate. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2185.46s)]
*  Because that's the kind of clips that we [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2186.94s)]
*  were playing on this network. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2188.1000000000004s)]
*  But people had not seen that before. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2189.34s)]
*  And then they were like, OK, yeah, now we have this lady. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2191.46s)]
*  You guys love this lady, yeah? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2196.14s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of people were like, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2197.7400000000002s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2199.36s)]
*  And I think you really can't overstate what a big impact that [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2200.54s)]
*  had on a lot of people. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2203.7400000000002s)]
*  I think you're correct. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2205.06s)]
*  Now we must move on. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2206.34s)]
*  It's Causing Liberal Insanity, watching Trump, Elon, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2207.78s)]
*  and Hannity. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgzY7n97pQ&t=2210.78s)]
