# Fox News Highlights - May 20th, 2025
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg)
*  The lies they tell. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, is it really news that the Biden administration, Hill Democrats, and all their buddies in the media lie nonstop? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's not to anyone who watched the angle over the past several years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=13.36s)]
*  And no, I don't give or intend to give any more media play to CNN's Jake Tapper, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=17.44s)]
*  just so he can promote his CYA book documenting Biden's decline. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=23.76s)]
*  The time to write that book was maybe three years ago, honey, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=28.64s)]
*  when it mattered to something more than your own bottom line. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=33.2s)]
*  Biden's cognitive collapse was visible to the naked eye since at least 2019. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  He was forgetting names, stumbling over basic thoughts, all the telltale signs of dementia's onset. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=43.2s)]
*  The sanctimonious CNN anchors, the liberal think tank types, saw what the rest of us saw. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=50.8s)]
*  And as time went on, the Democrats held their breath every time Biden made a public appearance [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=57.28s)]
*  or gave an interview. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=64.72s)]
*  I was in the foothills of the Himalayas, Xi Jinping. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=69.2s)]
*  Well, now we don't need a book written by one of the cover-up's primary collaborators [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=75.68s)]
*  to tell us how the White House tried to conceal his condition or prop him up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=80.64s)]
*  These are all clips from an angle that we did in early March 2020. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=84.72s)]
*  January of 2012. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=114.72s)]
*  Actually, 2013. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  No, wait a minute. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=122.08s)]
*  We got elected in 2012. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=122.88s)]
*  2000, January 13. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=124.8s)]
*  My name is Joe Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=126.88s)]
*  I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Five years ago, kids. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=132.32s)]
*  That was before the pandemic was declared, long before the election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=135.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was weekend at Biden's. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=139.28s)]
*  They were propping him up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=140.56s)]
*  So where were these intrepid journalists then? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=142.4s)]
*  If the Bidens and their doctors were refusing to divulge a cancer diagnosis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=146.32s)]
*  mental slippage, then they were likely emboldened by knowing that they had a willing press [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=150.64s)]
*  and a Democrat cover-up artist that didn't care. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=155.68s)]
*  And by the way, none of them should pretend to care now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  I want somebody to tell me, well, when did you know it was bad? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=162.64s)]
*  If you knew, why did you wait? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=166.48s)]
*  If you're telling me that hundreds of people knew that he was not able to do his job, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=168.56s)]
*  then where the hell was everybody? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=174.48s)]
*  Whoopi, where the hell was everybody? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=178.32s)]
*  Well, where the hell was everyone, Whoopi? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=180.56s)]
*  They were still peddling the Russian collusion farce. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=182.96s)]
*  They were still trying to paint Trump as an autocrat. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=185.76s)]
*  Autocrat and waiting once again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=189.12s)]
*  He's re-elected. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=191.44s)]
*  And of course, they were burying facts, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=192.88s)]
*  including famously about the Biden family crime syndicate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=194.56s)]
*  Three weeks before 2020, the election, the New York Post publishes its first story about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=199.04s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop, which as you might recall, included a reference to President Biden's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=204.48s)]
*  meeting with one of his son's business associates. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=210.08s)]
*  Now, of course, Biden went on to deny this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=213.36s)]
*  But then we learned that Tony Blinken helped orchestrate a disinformation campaign [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=216.08s)]
*  by former Intel officials who all insisted that the laptop was fake. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=221.6s)]
*  It was all lies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=227.44s)]
*  The press, the Democrats chose to ignore the obvious. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=230.32s)]
*  So the evidence pointed to the inescapable conclusion [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=235.12s)]
*  that the Bidens were selling influence and had been, by the way, for years. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=238.4s)]
*  Anyone remember James Comer's investigation? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=243.28s)]
*  Because he found that there were 20 shell companies set up to hide shady foreign payments [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  and also found that Joe Biden lied repeatedly about his involvement in these schemes, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=251.12s)]
*  that all enrich the Bidens to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=256.48s)]
*  But again, the press, Democrats, White House enablers, they did not care. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And yet we're supposed to now be shocked, I tell you, shocked, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=268.16s)]
*  that they were all lying about Biden in the White House all along. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  The book makes it very, very clear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  There are people who knew and said nothing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is a crime against this republic. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=282.48s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are going to pay for a long time [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=286.24s)]
*  for being a part of what is now being revealed to be a massive cover-up. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=288.88s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=293.68s)]
*  It's not now being revealed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=295.68s)]
*  It was revealed at least five years ago right here on The Angle. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=298.48s)]
*  Biden and company were so used to getting away with lying, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=304.0s)]
*  even about numbers, by the way, this is my favorite, that it became second nature. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=307.44s)]
*  And eventually they were called out on some of those number lies, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=312.32s)]
*  really important things like inflation, but they kept repeating the lies. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=315.52s)]
*  But now, well, the Bidens have nowhere to turn. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=319.84s)]
*  They have no cover because they're no longer useful to the powers that be. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=322.72s)]
*  But I want to say this tonight, let's not pretend there is any real awakening [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=328.88s)]
*  among the liberals or over the anchors over at the other networks. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=334.32s)]
*  Because if they had the chance to do it all again, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=338.4s)]
*  with that same chance of beating Trump and holding onto power, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=341.12s)]
*  they'd do it, I have no doubt. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's not forget what they did, the border cover-up. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  The message is quite clear, do not come. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=351.52s)]
*  The border is closed. The border is secure. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=354.32s)]
*  And after 13 Americans died at Abbey Gate, the Afghanistan withdrawal cover-up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=358.0s)]
*  It was the largest airlift conducted in U.S. history, and it was executed in 17 days. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=364.32s)]
*  Was it perfect? Of course not. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=372.08s)]
*  The following year, an Army investigation blames senior Biden, White House, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  and State Department officials for failing to grasp the Taliban's steady advance on the Capitol [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  before the evacuation, which put our troops in greater danger. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=385.12s)]
*  Again, they didn't demand accountability because their greater goal was pulling [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=389.92s)]
*  Joe over the finish line, long enough at least to send Trump into the wilderness. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=396.32s)]
*  So they've all destroyed their credibility, all of them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=402.08s)]
*  Yet they keep the play-acting going. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=406.0s)]
*  So shout out to the Biden family, Joe Biden, Dr. Joe Biden, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=409.2s)]
*  all of the Bidens that are dealing with this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=413.52s)]
*  Look, I have recently gone through a tragic situation in my family life, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=415.2s)]
*  and if people were focusing on the negative, I would tell them to go f*** off. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=421.52s)]
*  And mind your own business, get some business of your own. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=426.08s)]
*  Eloquent as usual, sour lemon. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=431.44s)]
*  Now consider acting lessons, I think, to some of these people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=434.32s)]
*  They need to work on their delivery. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=437.92s)]
*  I don't think they're even convincing themselves at this point. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=439.6s)]
*  Again, remember, when it mattered, they didn't care. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=442.24s)]
*  Instead, it was a get-Trump mentality 24-7. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=446.8s)]
*  Hold onto power by any means necessary. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=450.96s)]
*  Defeat Trump, indict Trump, slander Trump, defame Trump, jail Trump, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=453.76s)]
*  and they didn't care that the frenzy almost killed Trump. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=459.76s)]
*  And their heart of hearts? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  These people, I think they're so twisted up with rage toward America, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=466.64s)]
*  especially the Americans who voted for President Trump, they'd do it all again. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=470.96s)]
*  The following people, at least, this is the short list, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=476.4s)]
*  need to be brought to testify on Capitol Hill about all of this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=478.96s)]
*  Biden's Chiefs of Staff, Ron Klain and Jeff Zients. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=482.8s)]
*  Deputy Chief of Staff, Annie Tomasini, Jake Sullivan, Antony Blinken, Jen Psaki, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  Karin Jean-Pierre, oh yeah, and his doctor, in quotes, Kevin O'Connor. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=497.2s)]
*  The American people deserve answers and we'll keep demanding them, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  as we did five years ago. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=509.28s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=511.44s)]
*  With the Biden tell-alls coming out, Democrats are trying to scrub the blood off their hands. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=512.32s)]

*  The media is starting to confess that the cover-up they call the conspiracy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=541.76s)]
*  was actually a cover-up. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=546.48s)]
*  Quote, no serious journalistic outlet is pushing back. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=548.48s)]
*  Now it's the prevailing narrative. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=552.88s)]
*  What they're doing now is pointing fingers and asking each other, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=555.68s)]
*  what did you know and when did you know it over something everybody else already knew? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=559.52s)]

*  It's just fun to watch them not only continue to push the book in light of this difficult news, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=575.5999999999999s)]

*  Even the view is like, what is Jake Tapper, an author or an anchor? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=618.4s)]
*  All he's doing is hawking his book on the CNN and it's flanked by other people. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=625.04s)]

*  you know, hold themselves and their networks like CNN accountable for how much they didn't report on [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=650.1600000000001s)]

*  Tapper's taking on water and he's trying to survive. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=660.1600000000001s)]

*  Alex and I are here to say the conservative media was right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=672.72s)]

*  And that there should be a lot of soul searching, not just among me, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  but among the legacy media. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  Conservative media absolutely has every right to say we were hip to this and the legacy media was not. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=686.88s)]
*  Now I do not accept that I was part of a cover-up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=694.48s)]
*  I do not accept that I was just providing cover for Joe Biden. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  Jake searched his soul and found out he wasn't a part of the cover-up. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=702.9599999999999s)]
*  No one believes that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=707.52s)]
*  But if the media is admitting they were wrong about Biden, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=708.88s)]
*  when are they going to admit they were wrong about Trump? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=712.24s)]
*  Are we ever going to get, eh, maybe he's not a racist dictator. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=715.68s)]

*  That Laura Trump interview, for example, she saw something that I did not see at the time, 100%. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  And I own that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  After we did the research for this book, and I realized how bad his acuity issues were, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=744.8800000000001s)]
*  um, I like I, I mean, I, I called Laura Trump and I, I said you were, you were right. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  Jake didn't see what else everybody saw. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=760.72s)]
*  72% of the country said Biden wasn't fit for office and shouldn't serve another term. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  That was a CNN poll. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=770.0s)]
*  Jake thought Biden shaking hands with ghosts was just Joe being Joe. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=772.72s)]
*  The comments of Joe Biden making gaffes, saying things stupid, tripping are all important and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=777.84s)]
*  all deserved to be aired and all deserve scrutiny. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=786.48s)]
*  But as you know, Megan, because even though you look 30 years younger than me, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=789.36s)]
*  we're roughly the same age. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=792.88s)]
*  Joe Biden has been saying stupid things for decades. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=794.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=797.28s)]
*  I get what you're saying, but you, but that, but this minimizes it too, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=797.52s)]
*  because it was more than saying stupid things. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=800.88s)]
*  But I'm just, I'm telling you, like over here in my ecosphere, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=803.44s)]
*  we were covering all of these now with the current White House. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=806.96s)]
*  I have some connections with the Joe Biden White House. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  I had none, but you did, you did. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=813.6s)]
*  And so while you, you know, in Washington, 30 years, Jake, you guys, you and CNN have [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=816.32s)]
*  White House connections, but there was no effort, none to get to the bottom of this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=822.24s)]
*  The media held back scoops, waited until Biden got cooed and then cashed in on book deals. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  But before the coup, they told you Biden was at the top of his game. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  Start your tape right now, because I'm about to tell you the truth and F you if you can't [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  handle the truth. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=844.48s)]
*  This version of Biden intellectually, analytically is the best Biden ever. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  Now Scarborough's a Biden denier. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  Looking back at that, do you say, well, it was misleading to say [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  best Biden ever without caveating it and say, except on the days when he's not the best Biden? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=862.88s)]
*  Well, but I never, I never saw those days personally. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=868.88s)]
*  You did, you did because you saw him address a dead Congresswoman [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=871.84s)]
*  and you saw him in South Carolina. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=874.72s)]
*  There were plenty of days in public when he, when he was not the best Biden ever. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=876.24s)]
*  And of course, he stumbled and he stumbled and he stumbled and bumbled around, Mark. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=880.16s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he, he certainly did. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=884.56s)]
*  Donald Trump did, other politicians did. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=887.12s)]
*  Those are some of the clips bad. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=889.36s)]
*  Yeah, they certainly, they certainly are bad. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=891.44s)]
*  Put in the proper context, I'm just not going to freak out and melt down on it on, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=894.0s)]
*  on one or two clips here or there. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=898.08s)]
*  So when you go on live TV and you tell America something, that's the truth. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=900.96s)]
*  Say, this is true. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  You better be damn sure that's the truth. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=906.6400000000001s)]
*  It costs morning Joe, their audience. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=909.2s)]
*  No one watches him anymore. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  The audience got doged. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  Tapper says Biden was quarantined from his whole cabinet. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=914.96s)]
*  There's a cabinet meeting in October, 2023. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  And then several cabinet members told us for the book, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  they never saw him again in person for months and months and months. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=926.4000000000001s)]
*  He was kept away from them. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=931.12s)]
*  And cabinet secretaries we spoke to for the book told us it was weird. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  One of them did have a meeting with Biden in between that last cabinet meeting of 2023 in October [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=936.32s)]
*  and the debate and described him as being disoriented and out of it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=942.0s)]
*  And I think the degree to which he was being hidden from even their own administration [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=946.32s)]
*  cannot be overstated. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=952.96s)]
*  Remember the Biden White House was using auto pen. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=955.2s)]
*  Trump wants that investigated too. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=958.24s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=961.2s)]
*  I've looked at this whole thing with who signed this legislation, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=961.7600000000001s)]
*  who signed legislation opening our border. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=967.5200000000001s)]
*  I said, there's nobody that could want an open border. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=968.72s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=971.36s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't him. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=972.4000000000001s)]
*  He auto pended. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  Who was operating the auto pen? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a very serious thing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=979.7600000000001s)]
*  Biden was a ghost in his own White House. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=982.72s)]

*  those were auto pen. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=992.0s)]
*  And White House aides may have gotten rich. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=993.6s)]
*  You're going to find staffers that were able to take forms, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=997.36s)]
*  get them and run them through some sort of bogus legal system. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1001.0400000000001s)]
*  And then they, and then they auto pen them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1005.2s)]
*  And there's probably people out on the street that are, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1007.92s)]
*  they shouldn't be, but somebody got rich off that. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1010.16s)]
*  And, and that's, and I think those people, you'll, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1012.72s)]
*  I hate to say it, but you'll see something probably horrible [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1016.64s)]
*  happen to some of those people because it goes up the chain. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1019.6s)]
*  This is a very dangerous town to play games in. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1023.36s)]
*  And White House aides were getting rich too. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1028.16s)]
*  Mike Donilon, one of the guys in Biden's tight little inner circle. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1030.64s)]
*  He got paid $4 million to advise the campaign. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1034.72s)]
*  What campaign? Staffers called it outrageous when they found out. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1039.68s)]
*  The Kamala campaign, they were also getting fleeced for millions. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1045.44s)]
*  Oprah, Bruce, Beyonce. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1048.32s)]
*  So who knows what was going on? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1049.76s)]
*  The only reason we even know about any of this [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1052.48s)]
*  is because Biden bombed the debate. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1055.52s)]
*  And then after the debate, everybody started admitting it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1058.4s)]
*  One campaign advisor recounted a post-debate discussion [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1061.2s)]
*  with Biden aboard Air Force One. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1064.64s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1066.4s)]
*  The advisor thought as the president spoke. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  This guy can't even form an effing sentence. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1070.16s)]
*  Democrats went out and lied to you and said, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1073.76s)]
*  Biden just had the sniffles and attacked you for telling the truth. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1076.0s)]
*  Stephen A says Democrats deserve a spanking. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1080.56s)]
*  What did the Democratic party do when people brought up [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1084.48s)]
*  Joe Biden and his debilitation? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1088.24s)]
*  They didn't just deny it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1093.36s)]
*  They attacked and attempted to ostracize those who would dare question it [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1095.6s)]
*  and come to find out as the days and the weeks and the months go by [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1102.0s)]
*  how so many knew all along. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1106.32s)]
*  And not only did they not admit it, they condemned those who said so. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1110.32s)]
*  That's how I'm comparing them to Lance Armstrong. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1117.68s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1122.96s)]
*  Now Democrats don't want to talk about it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1124.56s)]
*  Don Lemon, another Biden denier, says let's move on. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1127.12s)]
*  I am so sick of all of this Joe Biden consternation. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1131.52s)]
*  What Joe Biden did or didn't do, what reporters did or didn't do. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1135.28s)]
*  The country has moved on. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1139.76s)]
*  Joe Biden has moved on. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1141.68s)]
*  And why are we talking about an old man who has cancer, prostate cancer? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1143.52s)]
*  Why are you kicking someone when they are down? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1147.76s)]
*  If they believe that Joe Biden was selfish, if they believe Joe Biden should have dropped out, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1150.72s)]
*  perhaps he should have. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  But that is not the question right now. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1156.0s)]
*  That is in the rear view mirror. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1157.76s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1160.16s)]
*  And they should stop hiring all these freaking Trump sycophant MAGA people [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1161.44s)]
*  and promoting them just to say outrageous, outlandish lies and. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1166.72s)]
*  CBS, they're trying to cover up the cover up. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1171.84s)]
*  They say Biden was too old to test for cancer. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1174.56s)]
*  He's 82. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1178.48s)]
*  Normally doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1179.76s)]
*  because after that the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1184.56s)]
*  And so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1189.6s)]
*  You're talking about risk versus benefit. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1195.6799999999998s)]
*  It may not be worth the risk. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1197.6s)]
*  CBS, I think just said Biden's life wasn't worth saving. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1200.56s)]
*  Because he was already pretty old. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1203.92s)]
*  Do you think Biden agrees? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1206.32s)]
*  He's only the president. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1208.16s)]
*  The former White House doctor, Ronnie Jackson, says something's not adding up. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1210.48s)]
*  Go back and look at the medical records. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1215.12s)]
*  President Bush, when he was in office, got a PSA done and is part of his physical exam. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  So did President Obama. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1220.56s)]
*  So did President Trump. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1221.76s)]
*  There is no reason why President Biden wasn't receiving PSAs and prostate screening exams [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1222.96s)]
*  during his time in office. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1229.76s)]
*  Or if he was, it wasn't reflected in the medical record, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1231.2s)]
*  which means that Dr. O'Connor was lying to the American people again. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  Biden's people are now, now they're telling us his last known prostate test was in 2014. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  That's over 10 years ago. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1245.2s)]
*  Do we even believe that? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1248.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1250.16s)]
*  In 2008, Joe Biden was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1251.04s)]
*  and he was taking Flomax for it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1256.16s)]
*  He even had a polyp removed from his colon. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1258.64s)]
*  Why didn't Dr. O'Connor test him for cancer? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1262.0s)]
*  According to Tapper's book, the Bidens have a history of covering up cancer. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1265.2s)]
*  When Bo was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1270.32s)]
*  the Bidens decided to say nothing for months. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1273.52s)]
*  And Bo's doctor said he had a clean bill of health, even though he died 15 months later. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1277.44s)]
*  Bidens had a history of bruises on his hands. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1284.48s)]
*  Some are wondering if he was getting drug cocktails injected there. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1287.4399999999998s)]
*  That's often where they put IVs. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1291.28s)]
*  Biden, before he dropped out, said the only thing that could force him out of the race [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1294.08s)]
*  was a medical condition. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1300.08s)]
*  Listen. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1301.52s)]
*  Is there anything that you would look to, you personally, not anybody else, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1302.9599999999998s)]
*  not other pundits, not even perhaps family members, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1306.9599999999998s)]
*  that you would look to to say, if I see that, I will reevaluate? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1310.2399999999998s)]
*  If there is some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came to me and said, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1315.44s)]
*  you got this problem, that problem. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1319.52s)]
*  Six days later, he dropped out. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1322.24s)]
*  So what happened on that fateful weekend in Delaware? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1325.52s)]
*  That's the question we need answers to. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1330.3200000000002s)]
*  Like we told you last week, the Biden blast radius keeps expanding, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1333.28s)]
*  and it's only going to get worse. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1338.4s)]
*  Also breaking tonight, a major policy win for the White House. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1340.56s)]
*  And more importantly, hardworking Americans in the service industry. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1343.84s)]
*  The U.S. Senate, get this, they just unanimously passed Donald Trump's No Tax on Tips Act. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1348.0s)]
*  Why did they ever think of it? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1355.04s)]
*  They would stand for the working men and women they used to. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1356.48s)]
*  Anyway, as per usual, this was a calculated political move by Democrats [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1359.6799999999998s)]
*  who are just pretending to be supportive of tax cuts. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  They only want piecemeal votes while really attempting to block the bill. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1368.32s)]
*  They're really attempting to block the president's big, beautiful tax package [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1372.64s)]
*  that includes several other tax cuts, including No Tax on Overtime or Social Security. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1376.88s)]
*  And of course, the extension of the Trump tax cuts to make them permanent from 2018. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1382.4s)]
*  If that bill passes, America will have the largest tax cut in history. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1387.92s)]
*  If Democrats ultimately get their way, taxes on all Americans who currently pay income taxes [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1392.96s)]
*  will go way up. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1399.44s)]
*  It will be the largest tax increase in American history. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1400.64s)]
*  Everyone's paycheck will go down. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1404.0s)]
*  That is why President Trump's big, beautiful tax bill is so imperative and important. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1406.0s)]
*  We're counting on the House tomorrow. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1411.28s)]
*  But we begin with the last three favorite words, threat to democracy, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  and well, their other favorite words, cheap, fake videos that were all too real. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1417.92s)]
*  Now, we've all heard Democrats and the legacy media mob use these words over and over and [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1423.52s)]
*  over again to attack Donald Trump. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1429.28s)]
*  But as it turns out, it was all projection. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1431.2s)]
*  Now even fake news CNN, even MSDNC are admitting that Joe Biden was not fit to serve [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1434.56s)]
*  for four long years and everyone on the left willfully and purposely propped up a mentally, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1441.84s)]
*  cognitively incompetent politician suffering from a steep decline. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1448.96s)]
*  Tonight, there is no debate. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  There never was. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1456.08s)]
*  America went four years without a president that had his full faculties. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1457.2s)]
*  And Democrats, they were ready to make it eight years before responding to polls and [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1462.16s)]
*  quickly making a bait and switch and installing Kamala Harris to run in Joey's place without [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1468.0s)]
*  any kind of democratic process at all whatsoever. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1474.8s)]
*  In other words, that was a threat to democracy. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1477.8400000000001s)]
*  A president in a cognitive decline is a massive national security threat. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1481.2s)]
*  But the Democrats and the legacy media mob, of course, hating Trump is always their number [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1486.16s)]
*  one top priority. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1491.2s)]
*  And to top that off, we are now suddenly learning that Biden, sadly, we pray for him and his [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1492.5600000000002s)]
*  family, they have been diagnosed, he's been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1497.8400000000001s)]

*  Most medical experts believe this likely took up to 10 years to get this bad. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1505.6000000000001s)]
*  But we're supposed to believe that Biden's cancer went totally, completely, utterly [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1510.88s)]
*  unnoticed during his time as president, despite the round the clock world class medical care. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1516.0s)]
*  I saw it for my own eyes in the Middle East last week. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  Any president has the best medical care at his disposal at all times as it should be. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  A Biden spokesperson telling Fox News that his last known PSA cancer screening test was 2014? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1531.68s)]
*  Every man I know gets one every year. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1540.4s)]
*  It's part of a blood test. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1543.28s)]
*  It's a simple test. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1544.8s)]
*  It's not a difficult test. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1546.24s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1547.52s)]
*  And of course, this leaves us with a lot of important questions. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1548.88s)]
*  First and foremost, why would we believe anything the Bidens, the media or Democrats tell us? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1552.0800000000002s)]
*  And here's something really important that must be answered. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1558.3200000000002s)]
*  Did Joe Biden know or understand anything that he was signing into law? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1561.92s)]
*  Was he even aware that auto pen was being used? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1566.56s)]
*  If the answer is no, are any of Biden's enacted laws and pardons executive orders? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1570.0s)]
*  Are they actually valid? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1575.76s)]
*  Now, earlier today, this is what President Trump had to say. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1579.84s)]
*  We're going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1581.44s)]
*  who signed legislation opening our border. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1585.2s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1587.76s)]
*  I said there's nobody that didn't want an open border. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1588.96s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1591.6s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't him. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1592.64s)]
*  He auto pended. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1595.04s)]
*  Who was operating the auto pen? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1596.8s)]
*  This is a very serious thing. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1598.8s)]
*  We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1600.0s)]
*  He auto pended almost everything. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1602.24s)]
*  He opened the borders of the United States of America. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1604.0s)]
*  And I kept saying, who would do such a thing allowing criminals to border in from all over [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1607.44s)]
*  the world, not just South America, all over the world? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1613.04s)]
*  Naturally, Democrats are left. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1616.72s)]
*  They don't want us to think about any of that instead. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1618.32s)]
*  Well, there are three political strategies, Democrats and their, of course, the extension [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1620.96s)]
*  of their press offices that media are using to gaslight all of you. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1626.0s)]
*  So be on the lookout for the following tactics. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1631.12s)]
*  First, some simply want the American people to forget about the last four years. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1633.44s)]
*  Let's just move forward. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1638.48s)]
*  Shall we take a look? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1639.84s)]
*  You said in June of last year, in my meetings with President Biden, I found to be command [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1642.16s)]
*  and the press said, and building influence to make progress on key priorities. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1647.36s)]
*  But in that same month, by an account, we did not even recognize George. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1651.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1655.76s)]
*  Fundraiser. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1656.32s)]
*  Were you being strayed with the American public? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1657.12s)]
*  Look, we're just looking forward. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1659.1999999999998s)]
*  We lied to you the whole time, but we're just looking forward. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  Why admit to the truth? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1665.12s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1666.48s)]
*  Who cares that we propped up a president and name only while Americans suffered and [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1667.52s)]
*  suffered greatly. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1673.12s)]
*  We have known terrorists and rapists and murderers, cartel members, gang members. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1674.08s)]
*  As a result of that, the next tactic is a little more [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1678.08s)]
*  dishonest. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1681.2s)]
*  So, of course, it's the favorite of the so-called journalists in the media. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  As our friend, liberal Joe says, our liberal Joe Scarborough demonstrated, some on the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1687.1200000000001s)]
*  left are still pretending they won't open their eyes. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1692.24s)]
*  They are pretending that there were no signs of Joe Biden's cognitive decline, which we [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1695.28s)]
*  chronicled before the 2020 election and almost every night in between. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1700.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1704.88s)]
*  Looking back at that, do you say, well, it was misleading to say best by never [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1706.4s)]
*  without caveatting and say, except on the days when he's not the best Biden ever? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1710.88s)]
*  Well, but I never saw those days personally. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1716.16s)]
*  You did. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1719.0400000000002s)]
*  You did because you saw him address a dead congresswoman and you saw him in South [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1719.5200000000002s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1722.8000000000002s)]
*  There were plenty of days in public when he was not the best Biden ever. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1723.44s)]
*  And of course, he was. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  He stumbled and he stumbled and he stumbled and bumbled around, Mark. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1728.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he certainly did. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1731.7600000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump did. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  Other politicians did. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1735.2s)]
*  Those are some of the clips bad. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1736.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they certainly they certainly are bad. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1738.64s)]
*  I put in the proper context. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1741.2s)]
*  I'm just not going to freak out and melt down on one or two clips here or there. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1742.5600000000002s)]
*  No, not one or two. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1748.5600000000002s)]
*  There's like one or two a day. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1749.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to hum it a hum it a hum it a great job, Mark Halpern, liberal Joe. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1750.72s)]
*  Nobody believes you. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1754.5600000000002s)]
*  You can quit the act, which brings us to our third political tactic. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1755.8400000000001s)]
*  And that is the left that they're using to cover their tracks over on fake news, CNN, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1759.76s)]
*  fake Jake Tapper. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1765.2s)]
*  He's even now looking to profit from this political gaslighting. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1766.56s)]
*  In fact, Tapper is out with some brand new book detailing the shocking discovery that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1770.6399999999999s)]
*  President Joe Biden was a cognitive mess and that the White House went to great lengths [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1775.9199999999998s)]
*  to conceal the truth. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1780.8s)]
*  So are we ever going to believe fake Jake was just totally blind, dumb and ignorant [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1782.56s)]
*  for four years? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1788.96s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1790.24s)]
*  Well, he's all of that. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1791.44s)]
*  But he also lied. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1792.96s)]
*  Of course, what fake Jake fails to mention is that his own network, they went to greater [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1794.32s)]
*  lengths masking Biden's cognitive cognitive decline during years of laughable reporting. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1799.28s)]
*  As late as 2024, CNN was still blaming Biden's stutter for his unusual public behavior. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1806.0s)]
*  Even Tapper himself once blaming Biden's obvious cognitive decline on his stutter. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1812.96s)]
*  And less than a year ago, the fake news network trashing, quote, right wing media outlets [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1818.24s)]
*  accusing them of using manipulated videos or what they were calling cheap fakes. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1823.76s)]
*  Well, after this program and others here on the Fox News channel dared to air very real [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1829.2s)]
*  videos of Biden wandering aimlessly, shaking air, air, tripping and falling and getting [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1835.36s)]
*  confused. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1841.52s)]
*  Well, you might remember some. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1842.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1844.32s)]
*  We're hearing about so-called cheap fakes. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1845.44s)]
*  It's playing out on right wing media, Fox, New York Post and so on. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1847.6s)]
*  And all of this is to try to make the case that Biden is slipping. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1851.92s)]
*  He's confused and so on. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1855.8400000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of videos going around about President Biden on social media, which ones [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1857.28s)]
*  are real, which ones are deceptively edited, now being called cheap fakes. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1860.88s)]
*  A lot of memes and what the White House is calling cheap fakes. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1865.44s)]
*  Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1870.96s)]
*  They're cheap. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1872.56s)]
*  They're just distorted out of context videos chopped up in certain ways, constructed in [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1873.2s)]
*  certain ways. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1877.92s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1878.56s)]
*  That's what the Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried about right now. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1879.44s)]
*  If Humpty Dumpty is on the other side, that means he's wrong. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever side he's on, he's wrong. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=1886.56s)]

*  All right, so the Biden book Original Sin is finally out, and so are the reviews. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2059.2s)]
*  According to Politico, it describes Biden as a, quote, ailing, geriatric leader surrounded by [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2063.92s)]
*  mendacious aides. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2069.68s)]
*  While the Washington Post details an elderly egotistical president shielded from reality by [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2071.76s)]
*  a slavish coterie of loyalists. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2077.44s)]
*  Never said that word before. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  So ailing, mendacious, egotistical, and that's from media outlets that spent four years smooching [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2083.36s)]
*  Biden's wrinkly ass. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2090.0s)]
*  They were so far up his butt, I'm surprised they didn't diagnose the cancer. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2092.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2101.76s)]
*  Enough. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2104.88s)]
*  But does this book tell the whole story? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2105.6800000000003s)]
*  Because even as the media is just now admitting this scandal was real, we know they're complicit. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2108.0s)]
*  They took their own sweet time addressing the greatest fraud in presidential history, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2113.76s)]
*  waiting till now, of course, to spill the beans. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2118.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, sure, the media could have made an honest mistake, like when they said Hunter's laptop was [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2121.76s)]
*  fake, or the fine people hoax was real, or that Tim Walz has a penis. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2126.32s)]
*  But what if the Biden cover-up was by design, orchestrated to protect not the president, but to [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2131.76s)]
*  enable a radical agenda? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  Anyone could tell Joe was feeble. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2140.88s)]
*  But what if Biden's decline wasn't caused by disability, but by debility, meaning he was [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2142.7200000000003s)]
*  purposely kept exhausted, confused, and miserable, like an overnight shift worker or a Fox and Friends [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2147.84s)]
*  viewer? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2154.96s)]
*  He was unfit, but it wasn't treated, it was welcomed. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2156.1600000000003s)]
*  Speeches, events, and overseas trips took their toll on Biden. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2163.84s)]
*  He became unable to function while his staff controlled his schedule to protect him. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2167.92s)]
*  Or so we thought. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2173.1200000000003s)]
*  They could have easily told the world, hey, this guy's no longer the man he used to be, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2174.7200000000003s)]
*  let's practice what we preach, country over party. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2178.88s)]
*  Instead, they treated him like Colonel Tom Parker treated Elvis. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2182.0s)]
*  Kept him full of meds and continued to push him out in front of live audiences in bright lights. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2186.64s)]
*  The only difference being, when Elvis forgot the words to hound dog, it didn't endanger the lives [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2192.32s)]
*  of everybody in the audience. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2197.04s)]
*  Letting Joe fade was the perfect crime, because his condition made him docile. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2199.44s)]
*  It's like when you exhaust your dog with a long walk before you have guests over. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2204.72s)]
*  I don't want Gus humping Dana Perino's leg. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2209.36s)]
*  Or for that matter, vice versa. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  So the story isn't just the cover-up of Joe's incapacity, it's why. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2219.84s)]
*  And yes, they didn't want America to know they pulled a giant horrible prank on them in 2020, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2225.36s)]
*  and they also didn't want to get massacred in 2024. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2229.92s)]
*  But the fact is, a debilitated Biden was an ideal Biden. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2232.32s)]
*  An enfeebled boss meant the underlings could do exactly what they wanted. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2236.16s)]
*  I'm certain that's why my staffers insist I eat an entire turkey for dinner [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2241.28s)]
*  and then make me watch Special Report. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2247.04s)]
*  But it solves the paradox of the last four years. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2252.08s)]
*  How did a candidate promoted as a reasonable centrist end up as the most radically progressive [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2254.96s)]
*  president in history? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2260.24s)]
*  The one who let our border dissolve, crime explode, and men invade women's spaces. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2262.3199999999997s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2266.72s)]
*  His debility was not a bug in the system. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2267.68s)]
*  It was the system. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2270.3199999999997s)]
*  An absent president meant others had control of the reins. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2271.8399999999997s)]
*  And the signs are there, like the absurd number of people granted clemency, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2275.2s)]
*  or the orgy of auto-penned EOs. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2279.44s)]
*  What, you think they nail-gunned the auto-penn to Joe's hand while he was [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2282.16s)]
*  out like a light dreaming of corn pop and cannibals? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  So now, they want to talk about Biden's health? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2288.72s)]
*  Sorry, the jig is up. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2292.3999999999996s)]
*  They can't pretend they're compassionate caregivers protecting a fragile leader when [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2294.0s)]
*  we now know how the policies under Joe were anything but feeble. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  Biden was a mess, but the policies were a coherent wish list for the woke. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2303.68s)]
*  The freaks running the show knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2309.6s)]
*  Sure, their decisions were horrible and destructive, but they were also [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2312.64s)]
*  deliberate and no product of dementia, which makes it way worse than criminal. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2316.16s)]
*  It's treason. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2320.96s)]
*  They exploited an unhealthy elderly man, and we can't let them get away with it. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2322.16s)]
*  So yeah, it's tragic Joe has cancer, but the people who propped him up for four [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2327.12s)]
*  years, they are a cancer. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2331.12s)]
*  And it's time they got the treatment they deserve. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2334.16s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2390.0s)]
*  You're making a point there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2390.8s)]
*  Maybe it was not his fault at all. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  I read the book. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2392.96s)]
*  I think it's a great title. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2393.92s)]

*  Yeah, because think about how what a good idea, because it's called The Original Sin. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2396.72s)]
*  And did you know that Joe Biden's first job was a gardener in Eden? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2399.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm a fan of, I love a book about Joe being mentally incapacitated while being a president. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  It's part of the super obvious series by this publisher. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2413.2s)]

*  And what did you take away from the release of Original Sin? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2426.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, the Original Sin was the choice by the Democrat party to lie to the American people [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2432.24s)]
*  about the man they propped up to be president of the United States. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2436.48s)]
*  I worked on the 2020 campaign for President Trump. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2439.68s)]
*  We regularly said he is an empty vessel being filled by the radical left. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2442.3999999999996s)]
*  And whoopsie poopsie, we happen to be completely correct because Ron Klain, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2447.2s)]
*  his chief of staff, who was still in that inner sanctum as Joe Biden fell apart, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2451.4399999999996s)]
*  was pursuing incredibly aggressive progressive policies that now we're having to pay for. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2456.16s)]
*  And when we all stood up in 2020 and pointed out the obvious, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2462.08s)]
*  not only about his decline, but about the radical left, we were shouted down on network after network. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2465.3599999999997s)]

*  Whoopsie poopsie. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2501.68s)]
*  You're welcome. You can keep that one. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2503.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna steal it. Whoopsie poopsie. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2505.12s)]
*  That was... [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2507.8399999999997s)]
*  Loftus. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2508.72s)]
*  You know... [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2511.04s)]
*  Whoopsie poopsie was my rap name in college. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2511.2799999999997s)]
*  Whoopsie poopsie is like a product for incontinence for elderly rappers. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2514.16s)]
*  As the Joe Biden underwear line. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2520.96s)]
*  Do you laugh? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2523.28s)]
*  Do you suffer from whoopsie poopsie? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2524.24s)]
*  Are you president of the United States? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2527.28s)]
*  You know, you were... [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2529.92s)]
*  You gotta feel some kind of chagrin. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2531.28s)]
*  You know, you were saying right up front early on that Biden was incapacitated, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2532.96s)]
*  and everyone at the soup kitchen laughed at you. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2537.52s)]
*  They did, yes. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2540.96s)]
*  They did, and I didn't like that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2542.4s)]
*  I took my shopping cart and I just went out to the sidewalk and I went home. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2549.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like... I'm not gonna buy the book. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2551.6s)]
*  No. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2554.08s)]
*  If I want Joke Trapper to lie to me, I can just watch it on TV. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2554.4s)]
*  The guy, like, it's a farce that he wants now to charge people money to listen to. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2560.4s)]
*  I was tricked. I was fooled. We thought he was fine. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2566.48s)]
*  And here's the other thing that I want to know. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2570.64s)]
*  Where was the GOP on this? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2572.4s)]
*  You got the Speaker of the House now going, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2574.72s)]
*  yeah, Joe totally forgot about signing an executive order. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2577.04s)]
*  He was... Dude, there's an owner's manual. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2580.16s)]
*  The Founding Fathers put the 25th Amendment in there. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2583.2799999999997s)]
*  You can go, hey, look, that guy's a mental case. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2586.8799999999997s)]
*  We should maybe do a switcheroo on that. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2589.12s)]
*  It's madness. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2592.3199999999997s)]
*  It is madness. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2594.16s)]
*  Total madness. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2595.92s)]
*  Extreme madness. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2597.04s)]
*  It's the kind of madness that makes you say whoopsie poopsie. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2598.16s)]
*  Kennedy, see, I get a second dose of you in one day. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2606.8799999999997s)]
*  You were just on the five. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2609.6s)]
*  It was delightful. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2611.44s)]
*  It is clear that while Biden was a mess, the policy wasn't. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2613.44s)]
*  That's so interesting to me. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2617.8399999999997s)]
*  We sat there and go, like, everything's falling apart. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2618.96s)]
*  But there was a lot of policy that was hard left. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2621.2s)]
*  There was a lot of policy that we didn't like. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2623.2799999999997s)]
*  But it was very cohesive if you're looking at a group of people who are entirely progressive. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2625.76s)]
*  You know, look at the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2630.8s)]
*  That had nothing to do with inflation reduction. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2634.0s)]
*  That was all a big climate bill. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2636.88s)]
*  And that's exactly what they were doing with every executive order. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  It was just a new way to push forward their political agenda that was very, very far to the left. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2643.6000000000004s)]
*  And now they conveniently want you to move past that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2650.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, the people who put that entire Biden system in place, they're still in power. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2653.6s)]
*  You know, Hakeem Jeffries, he met with the president. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2658.96s)]
*  He knew how far in decline he was. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  So did Chuck Schumer. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2664.4s)]
*  But it benefited them because they were in power at the beginning of the Biden administration. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2665.68s)]
*  You also had Jill Biden, and she got all the stuff. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2670.88s)]
*  She got the gowns and the ball and the jet. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2673.44s)]
*  She got everything. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2676.4s)]
*  James and Hunter, Joe's brother and son, they got rich when there was [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2678.16s)]
*  the threat of the Biden presidency and the ultimate power play. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2683.04s)]
*  That's when the grift went off. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2686.72s)]
*  Jill didn't do that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2688.32s)]
*  She waited patiently. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2689.44s)]
*  And once she got there, she wasn't going to let it go. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2690.64s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2693.44s)]
*  Joe is a narcissistic blowhard as well. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2694.24s)]
*  He got to be president. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2697.36s)]
*  And that's all he ever wanted was to be on the place mat really close to his best friend, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2698.88s)]
*  Barack Obama, just one inconvenient guy in between them. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2704.4s)]
*  And so they all built the system together. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2708.96s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2711.76s)]
*  And when the Jenga piece was pulled out, which was the last shred of his memory and cognitive function, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2713.28s)]
*  and the whole thing fell apart, guess who was the moderator at the debate where he imploded? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2720.4s)]
*  Jake Tapper. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2725.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2726.2400000000002s)]
*  And you know what we say to that? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2728.48s)]
*  Whoopsie poopsie. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2730.96s)]
*  Whoopsie poopsie. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2733.76s)]
*  And if you want to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo56Ox63kg&t=2741.76s)]
