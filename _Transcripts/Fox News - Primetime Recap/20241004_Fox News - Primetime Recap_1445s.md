# Fox News Primetime Recap - Oct. 3, 2024
**Fox News - Primetime Recap:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs)
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1.6s)]
*  A lot to get to. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=4.04s)]
*  Jam-packed show breaking just moments ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=5.12s)]
*  The port strike temporarily suspended [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=7.68s)]
*  until after the election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=11.6s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  More on that in moments. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=14.24s)]
*  But first, the stranding of America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=15.72s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=19.56s)]
*  All right, did Joe and Kamala care more [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=24.2s)]
*  about the millions of illegals [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=28.04s)]
*  coming across our border [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=30.8s)]
*  than the people struggling [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=32.8s)]
*  in the storm ravaged southeast? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=35.0s)]
*  Over the past four years, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=38.84s)]
*  Democrats led by Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=40.4s)]
*  racked up over $7.9 trillion in spending, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=43.12s)]
*  sending our national debt to over $35.6 trillion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  But somehow, after all that spending, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=54.0s)]
*  it turns out we don't have the money [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=56.32s)]
*  we need to rescue and help our fellow Americans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=58.68s)]
*  We haven't seen FEMA. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=62.4s)]
*  We haven't seen Red Cross. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=64.2s)]
*  We haven't seen harvests with hands. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=65.84s)]
*  We've seen no agencies come through here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=67.84s)]
*  Most people drive through with their cameras out, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=70.4s)]
*  filming us like we're animals in a zoo, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=73.08s)]
*  and don't stop. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=75.76s)]
*  When this is allowed to happen, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  how do we even qualify as a superpower anymore? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=81.4s)]
*  How can the people running things [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=85.88s)]
*  be this heartless and this incompetent? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=88.08s)]
*  Ensuring that we have money and supplies [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  set aside for emergencies [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=94.72s)]
*  is a basic duty of government officials. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  So we expect that when we allow our fellow citizens, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=98.92s)]
*  we help them when they're under siege [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=102.12s)]
*  by a natural disaster like this, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=104.16s)]
*  that our top officials will be fed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  will be fully engaged. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=110.4s)]
*  But as hurricane victims were waiting for relief, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=113.64s)]
*  Kamala was rallying supporters in Vegas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=116.2s)]
*  Six days after the lights went out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  and the floodwaters rose in Georgia, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  she did finally do a drop-by. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=125.92s)]
*  The federal relief and assistance [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=129.32s)]
*  that we have been providing has included [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=131.0s)]
*  FEMA providing $750 for folks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=134.44s)]
*  who need immediate needs being met, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=138.48s)]
*  such as food, baby formula, and the like. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  Imagine losing your house, your transportation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=145.04s)]
*  basic necessities, and women looking for diapers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=149.12s)]
*  Earlier today, I was watching. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=152.56s)]
*  Most stores, by the way, in the area are wiped out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  And all you're getting right now is a $750 check, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  she referenced, from the federal government, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=162.92s)]
*  the government you've been sending taxes to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  for your entire life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=167.88s)]
*  Yeah, and where are they gonna buy that baby food, Kamala? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Of course, the man who allowed the migrant invasion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=174.88s)]
*  into the US is trying to pass the buck [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=176.96s)]
*  by saying, well, we're out of bucks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=179.56s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=182.76s)]
*  with the money that we have. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=186.56s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=188.56s)]
*  We do not have the funds, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=191.44s)]
*  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=193.04s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=198.28s)]
*  They seem to have no hesitation about setting aside [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=199.48s)]
*  massive amounts of money for their foreign priorities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=201.8s)]
*  If you wanna see how sick and distorted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=206.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris' priorities are, just consider FEMA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=209.24s)]
*  Kamala spent all her FEMA money, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=213.12s)]
*  billions of dollars on housing for illegal migrants. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=216.36s)]
*  Now, Mayorkas, in a written statement today, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=222.6s)]
*  disputed these claims, saying that migrant money, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=224.64s)]
*  well, it had already been allocated. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=227.88s)]
*  Oh, big deal, I heard that, I was like, so? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=230.0s)]
*  And anyway, that's the point, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  Democrats are prioritizing the needs of non-citizens. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=234.32s)]
*  And now we learn many of them [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=239.44s)]
*  are violent, depraved criminals, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=241.44s)]
*  prioritizing their needs ahead of the people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  that our leaders are supposed to be serving. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=248.16s)]
*  Now, just over the past two years, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=251.76s)]
*  FEMA has spent more than a billion dollars to house illegals. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=253.6s)]
*  It allocated nearly 364 million just in fiscal year 2023. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=258.6s)]
*  And for fiscal year 2024, the figure is close to double that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=263.6s)]
*  And that helps illegals following their being released [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=269.56s)]
*  all over the United States. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  This is disgraceful. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=275.0s)]
*  And every Democrat running for office should be hammered [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=277.92s)]
*  for failing to shut this down, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=282.04s)]
*  for failing, of course, to secure the border, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=283.88s)]
*  could do it with a strike of a pen, right, Joe? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=286.24s)]
*  And for voting for their monster spending bills. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=289.56s)]
*  All they did was shortchange Americans, drive up inflation, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=293.52s)]
*  saddle us with debt in order to give gobs of money [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=298.44s)]
*  to liberal special interests. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=302.24s)]
*  So why did Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=305.12s)]
*  think this was a good idea? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=307.76s)]
*  How about Sherrod Brown in Ohio? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=309.48s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=311.36s)]
*  Do they do any oversight up there on Capitol Hill? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=314.48s)]
*  If not, why not? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=317.16s)]
*  They say that in a crisis, you see what someone is made of. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=319.88s)]
*  Well, we need a cabinet stacked [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  with brilliant, experienced people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=326.8s)]
*  But Kamala, of course, is gonna sit and pick [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=330.2s)]
*  the same type of woke firsts that Biden picked. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=332.0s)]
*  The first this, the first that, forget the first resume. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=336.2s)]
*  The king of people who think getting a briefing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=340.56s)]
*  is the same as leading. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=342.84s)]
*  I was at the FEMA command center a couple of days ago, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=346.32s)]
*  received a briefing alongside Secretary Mayorkas. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=349.52s)]
*  The level of coordination and dedication [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=351.92s)]
*  going on out there is incredible. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=353.92s)]
*  It's inspiring. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=355.48s)]
*  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that man was a Rhodes Scholar. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=357.96s)]
*  Now, incompetence is the common denominator here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=363.96s)]
*  How else do you explain the fact [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=366.68s)]
*  that FEMA is still, still approving new COVID expenditures? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  We're still tracking the COVID fraud, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=374.11999999999995s)]
*  and they're still sending out money for COVID relief. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=376.4s)]
*  Again, everyone is asleep at the switch, zero oversight. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=379.4s)]
*  And by the way, if we had a curious, impartial media, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  they would press Kamala Harris and Mayorkas [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=389.64s)]
*  on all of these questions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=393.32s)]
*  Look, we know what the press did to Bush and Katrina. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  But of course, look, the press right now [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  is too busy trying to help Harris. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=402.56s)]
*  Look what happened at that vice presidential debate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=403.88s)]
*  with the moderators. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=405.72s)]
*  But circling the wagons for her is really, really stupid. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Because given what's gone down, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=412.48s)]

*  whether this is just incompetent leadership [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  with this hurricane, Helene, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  or is it purposefully withholding aid [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  from counties that supported Trump? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=427.16s)]
*  In the absence of leadership, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=429.6s)]
*  conspiracy theories will, will just fly. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=431.48s)]
*  Now, this administration has been an epic failure. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  We're seeing it play out. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=440.48s)]
*  And those responsible for leaving Americans stranded [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  in North Carolina, well, they're also responsible [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  for stranding the rest of the country [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  with a flood of illegal aliens, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  and of course, just horrific inflation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=453.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Mayorkas, Yellen, Raimondo, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=457.08s)]
*  all of them should never be allowed [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=462.76s)]
*  near positions of power again. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=464.96s)]
*  Because after another four years of this, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=467.84s)]
*  there'll be nothing left of the America we love. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=470.32s)]
*  So we can't wait. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=473.64s)]
*  We have to rescue ourselves on November 5th. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=475.56s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=479.56s)]
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  And tonight, I've got to prepare all of you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=481.56s)]
*  to get very angry because what we're about to share [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=483.84s)]
*  with you will rightly make your blood boil. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=486.52s)]
*  As most of you know, ports, by the way, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=489.44s)]
*  along the East Coast were shut down this week [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=491.08s)]
*  because of a union leader's demands. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=493.52s)]
*  We have the update on that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=496.68s)]
*  And including a reported 75% pay raise for dock workers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=498.36s)]
*  I think now the employers are up to 62%. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=503.12s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of them make six figures. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=507.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris supported this shutdown. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=509.24s)]
*  Which cost you, the American people, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=512.52s)]
*  is costing us billions of dollars a day. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=514.48s)]
*  They only kicked the can down the road. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=516.36s)]
*  The strike is temporarily on hiatus. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=518.4s)]
*  But this story can get much, much worse. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=521.04s)]
*  As all of you know, much of Appalachia, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=523.24s)]
*  the Gulf Coast of Florida, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=525.8s)]
*  from the Gulf Coast of Florida, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=527.52s)]
*  reeling from Hurricane Helene. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=529.88s)]
*  This was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=532.04s)]
*  These regions desperately, desperately, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=534.76s)]
*  desperately need supplies coming through those ports, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=537.84s)]
*  and the state of Florida is now backed up. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=542.44s)]
*  Last weekend, Joe was sitting without a care in the world [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=545.2s)]
*  on the beach in his little beach chair. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=548.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris out hobnobbing with her rich Hollywood friends, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=549.72s)]
*  both for the most part, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=553.12s)]
*  MIA in states that have been completely devastated. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  But here's the real problem. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=558.2s)]
*  In North Carolina and Georgia, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  in Tennessee, South Carolina, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=561.96s)]
*  and in the state of Florida, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=563.76s)]
*  they need immediate help, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=565.52s)]
*  especially North Carolina and Georgia, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=567.52s)]
*  to get the money for the hurricane. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=571.0s)]
*  And the state of Florida, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  it's the only state in the country [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  that has a hurricane management agency, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  or what we call FEMA. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=579.16s)]
*  It has now been a full week, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=581.04s)]
*  and this is what we learned today. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=583.4s)]
*  FEMA is out of money, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=585.48s)]
*  and wait till you hear the reason why. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=588.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=590.0s)]
*  We are meeting the immediate needs [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=591.0s)]
*  with the money that we have. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=594.8s)]
*  We are expecting another hurricane hitting. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  Remember, I interviewed Governor Kemp of Georgia. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=600.64s)]
*  I interviewed Governor DeSantis, my state of Florida, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=603.32s)]
*  and they had both pre-positioned utility trucks, supplies. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  Everybody knew that a massive category four hurricane [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=610.32s)]
*  was on the way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=613.64s)]
*  Joe and Kamala, they prepared for absolutely nothing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=614.48s)]
*  At the very least, they should have at least understood [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=619.1600000000001s)]
*  that they were gonna run out of monies [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=622.84s)]
*  allocated for this storm. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=624.84s)]
*  And where did all the money go? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=626.76s)]
*  The flood's really gonna get hot. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  Until last week, it was a relatively calm hurricane system. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=630.76s)]
*  And here's where this story gets infuriating [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  and beyond disgraceful. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=639.68s)]
*  we now have learned, rated FEMA's piggy bank [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=641.8s)]
*  for other endeavors. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  They took over $1 billion of FEMA funds [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=647.36s)]
*  supposed to be available for national emergencies [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=651.64s)]
*  to help you, the American people, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=655.8s)]
*  God forbid there's an emergency as bad as this one. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  And they spent all of that money [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=661.16s)]
*  on their 11.5 million unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  from over 180 other countries, by the way, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=668.64s)]
*  including countries with terror ties [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  and our top geopolitical foes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=674.0s)]
*  And they use that money for free food, housing, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  healthcare, education, sex change surgeries, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  debit cards, four-star hotels for illegal immigrants [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=684.24s)]
*  on top of the billions and billions they'd already spent. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=688.2s)]
*  Now, there just aren't enough funds, what, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=691.6s)]
*  for the people of North Carolina, South Carolina, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  our friends in Tennessee, our friends in Georgia, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  our friends here in the state of Florida. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=699.84s)]
*  In the weeks since Helene, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  only $4 million has been distributed [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=703.48s)]
*  to Americans devastated by the storm. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=707.44s)]
*  Person after person calling into my radio show saying, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=710.44s)]
*  they haven't seen a single emergency worker, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=713.64s)]
*  FEMA representative on the ground. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=716.0s)]
*  Hundreds of Americans we know lost their lives. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=718.28s)]
*  Hundreds are now unaccounted for and missing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=721.4s)]
*  People don't have homes, they don't have food, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=724.84s)]
*  they don't have water, they don't have housing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=727.2s)]
*  Up until Donald Trump contacted Elon Musk, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=729.76s)]
*  they didn't have any communications. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=733.16s)]
*  They've been completely abandoned by your border czar [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=735.16s)]
*  who prioritized her unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  over the American people [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=742.56s)]
*  and hasn't lifted a finger in over a week. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=744.76s)]
*  And now we find out a week later, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=747.8s)]
*  they don't have any money. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  The little money that they have given out [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=750.92s)]
*  is described as a one-time grant [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  that gives storm victims a lousy, what, $750. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=756.36s)]
*  Can they open their eyes? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=761.84s)]
*  Are they not aware of the devastation? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=763.36s)]
*  We don't even know how many other people are in deep trouble [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=765.64s)]
*  because they can't get to them [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=770.0s)]
*  and they haven't put the resources forward to get to them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=771.68s)]
*  You have illegal immigrants getting everything, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=775.28s)]
*  including free sex change operations, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=777.4799999999999s)]
*  courtesy of you, the taxpayer, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=779.52s)]
*  while American citizens in North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=781.4799999999999s)]
*  Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina lost everything [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=785.0799999999999s)]
*  and they get nothing but the middle finger from Joe Biden [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=788.4399999999999s)]
*  and border czar Kamala Harris. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  Let me be clear, this is rightly Kamala's Katrina [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=794.28s)]
*  on steroids and human growth hormone. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=801.0s)]
*  they've allocated close to $200 billion to Ukraine, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=803.72s)]
*  8 billion more just last week. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=807.68s)]
*  How about we withhold that payment [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=810.72s)]
*  and give it to the people of North Carolina, Georgia [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=812.44s)]
*  that are devastated? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=814.6s)]
*  This is an administration that has given [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=816.04s)]
*  nearly $3 billion to the Taliban [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=818.56s)]
*  and they can't help our own citizens? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=822.96s)]

*  and so many of our allies, well, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=833.24s)]
*  they were taken out of their homes [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=835.4s)]

*  South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=886.4s)]

*  Oh, why is that? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=894.76s)]
*  Because it's Republican areas? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=895.68s)]
*  What a repulsive disgrace. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=897.68s)]
*  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=899.9599999999999s)]

*  baffled, stunned by the White House [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=903.84s)]
*  that refused to issue an emergency declaration offer [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=906.92s)]

*  that were devastated by this hurricane. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=913.96s)]
*  He needed that declaration for 90 counties. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=916.2800000000001s)]
*  They only gave him 11. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=919.12s)]
*  He had to get back on the phone with the White House [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  and begging Biden's chief of staff, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=923.6s)]
*  Joe was probably taking a nap, to take more action. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=925.64s)]
*  And he only got 30 more of the 90 counties [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=928.96s)]
*  that he needed covered. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=931.72s)]

*  North Carolina and everyone in between. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  Wow, pretty unbelievable. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=938.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=939.76s)]
*  When the first emergency declarations came down, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=941.12s)]
*  there was only 11 counties in that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=944.16s)]
*  A lot of people were outraged, including me, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=946.52s)]
*  because there was such devastation in, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=948.92s)]
*  in, you know, up to 90 counties. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=950.68s)]
*  So we called the White House. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=953.32s)]
*  We spoke to the, to the president's chief of staff, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=954.6s)]
*  the FEMA administrator and said, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=957.44s)]
*  look, you're sending the signal that, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=959.72s)]
*  that you're not paying attention [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=961.8s)]
*  to some of these rural communities. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=963.36s)]
*  Egypt's abandoning Georgia, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=965.96s)]
*  North Carolina and every state in between. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=967.64s)]
*  Everybody knew this hurricane was coming. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=969.96s)]
*  Governor Kemp did his job, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=973.48s)]
*  pre-positioned utility trucks, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  supplies available for the people of Georgia. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=976.76s)]
*  Governor DeSantis did the same thing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=979.2s)]
*  Everyone knew it would be a major cat three, four storm. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=981.24s)]
*  Where was the federal government? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=985.4000000000001s)]
*  And why didn't we find out till today [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=987.32s)]
*  that FEMA ran out of money? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=989.8000000000001s)]
*  And why didn't Biden and Harris pre-position a thing? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  And why did they, you know, reallocate these funds [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=995.0s)]
*  to help the 11 and a half illegals [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=998.56s)]
*  that shouldn't be in the country anyway? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  Why did they raid FEMA funds for illegals? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1002.48s)]
*  Why isn't FEMA on the ground in these areas [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1009.0s)]
*  Georgia and Florida now? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1011.92s)]
*  And I'll say this, God bless the Reverend Billy, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1013.76s)]
*  Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son and Samaritan's Purse. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1016.52s)]
*  Thank God, I donated to them this week myself. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1020.04s)]

*  they need your help. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1024.68s)]
*  And thank God for Donald Trump. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1026.0s)]
*  He actually got on the ground long before Kamala and Joe [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  and then saw the devastation, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1031.3999999999999s)]
*  got on the phone with his friend, Elon Musk. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1032.9599999999998s)]
*  And Elon Musk, you know, sent in Starlink [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1035.6s)]
*  to establish communications [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  where there was none at all whatsoever. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1039.9199999999998s)]
*  There would be zero help. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1042.7199999999998s)]
*  People would be dying without communications. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1044.12s)]
*  And according to numerous reports on the ground, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1047.28s)]
*  the administration has been so painfully slow, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1049.32s)]
*  they're not even there now. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1051.76s)]
*  And leaving Americans to suffer [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1053.6s)]
*  and fend for themselves in communities [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1056.0s)]

*  You can't make it up, it's so bad. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1062.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1064.64s)]
*  We've seen our friends and neighbors lose their homes. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1066.08s)]
*  We've seen classrooms of children [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1070.64s)]
*  who have no longer have their homes. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1073.96s)]
*  We are hunting for teachers. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1078.2s)]

*  Is there anything you'd love to make sure [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1095.44s)]
*  that they know both President Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  as they head to that region today? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1099.96s)]
*  We need so much help. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1103.6s)]

*  we're not separate. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1113.28s)]
*  A week late and billions of dollars short, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1115.96s)]
*  this is Kamala Harris, border czar. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1118.6s)]
*  This is her Katrina in many areas across the Southeast. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1121.08s)]
*  Communications have been totally down. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1125.0s)]
*  No cell service, no internet, no phones. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1127.28s)]
*  Last year, let's follow the bouncing ball, shall we? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1129.52s)]
*  The same Biden-Harris administration [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1133.32s)]
*  rescinded a starling contract, that's Elon Musk's company, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1135.84s)]
*  even when Elon was the low bidder. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1140.36s)]
*  By the way, the same Elon that's gonna go save the astronauts [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1143.6399999999999s)]
*  that are lost in space thanks to Kamala [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1146.4799999999998s)]
*  leading up that agency. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  And they would have been able to connect [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1150.7199999999998s)]
*  nearly 700,000 homes to the internet [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1153.24s)]
*  in these exact rural areas like Appalachia. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1157.28s)]
*  They clearly revoked the deal with Elon Musk [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1161.04s)]
*  for political reasons. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1163.76s)]
*  So now Musk gets a call from Trump, is working, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1164.9599999999998s)]
*  and to his credit, he's been able to rush [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1169.44s)]
*  Starlink terminals to the region [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1171.8s)]

*  Samaritan's Purse today, and they said [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1179.68s)]
*  they need generators to run Starlink. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1181.76s)]
*  I said, well, can I raise more money? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1184.0s)]
*  Can I give you more money? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1185.68s)]
*  Because the communications, we don't even know [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1187.24s)]
*  if people are without food and water and about to die [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1189.56s)]
*  after six days of them doing nothing. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1193.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden was mentally checked out for months. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1195.88s)]

*  should be provided on the basis of race and equity. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1212.0s)]
*  We're gonna play politics and insert DEI [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1217.3200000000002s)]
*  into disaster relief? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1224.2800000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1225.4s)]
*  It is our lowest income communities [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1226.64s)]
*  and our communities of color that are most impacted [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1230.4s)]
*  by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1234.68s)]
*  that are not of their own making. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1240.24s)]
*  And so we- [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1241.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1243.5600000000002s)]
*  And so we have to address this in a way [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1244.4s)]
*  that is about giving resources based on equity, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1247.44s)]
*  understanding that we fight for equality, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1251.0s)]
*  but we also need to fight for equity, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1253.4s)]
*  understanding not everyone starts out at the same place. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1254.88s)]
*  And if we want people to be in an equal place, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1257.64s)]
*  sometimes we have to take into account those disparities. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1259.96s)]
*  How about in a situation like this, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1263.72s)]
*  how about we all band together, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1265.96s)]
*  you help out any and every American based on their need [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1267.8000000000002s)]
*  and you do it as soon as possible [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1271.2800000000002s)]
*  and don't sit on your ass for a week like they have. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1272.8400000000001s)]
*  How about you don't steal money for illegal immigrants [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1275.2800000000002s)]
*  for their sex change operations, free housing, healthcare, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1278.92s)]
*  food, education, et cetera, and amnesty, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1282.44s)]
*  and you leave the money where it belongs in a lockbox [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1285.4s)]
*  for emergencies when they happen for FEMA. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  Do the people of Appalachia just not look the right way? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1292.64s)]
*  Maybe you don't like how they vote historically, you know, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1295.76s)]
*  and they don't deserve federal aid. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1298.8s)]
*  They're Americans. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1301.04s)]
*  They are desperately in need and have been for a week [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  and you have abandoned them. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1305.52s)]
*  In the past four years, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1307.24s)]
*  Kamala has passionately called for billions of dollars, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1308.6000000000001s)]
*  let's see, to repay student debt, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1311.6s)]
*  provide sex change operations, not only for illegals, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  but also convicts in jail, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1316.8s)]
*  vowed to eliminate the filibuster, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1319.0s)]
*  to spend $93 trillion on the Green New Deal, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1321.32s)]
*  a cradle to grave society. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1324.56s)]
*  By the way, any of you out there [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1326.36s)]
*  wanna trust your government? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1327.84s)]
*  When it comes to hurricane victims, the passion is gone. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  No desperate pleas for funding. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1332.6s)]
*  She didn't even bother to step away [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1334.28s)]
*  from her lavish Hollywood fundraisers over the weekend. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1336.04s)]
*  Biden wouldn't come back from the beach. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1340.16s)]
*  Too lazy to get his ass out of that beach chair [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1342.0s)]
*  and do his job. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1344.48s)]
*  It took Kamala and Joe a week to visit the Southeast. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1345.72s)]
*  Remember 2005, George W. Bush mocked, ridiculed, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1348.96s)]
*  called racist for his hurricane response [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1352.12s)]
*  to Hurricane Katrina? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1356.12s)]
*  The criticism was on day two, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1357.68s)]
*  the second day after it occurred. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1360.16s)]
*  According to the New York Times, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1362.48s)]
*  he was blasted for not returning to Washington [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1363.8799999999999s)]
*  from his Texas vacation until Wednesday afternoon [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  two days after the Monday hurricane. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, and he flew over Katrina, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1371.92s)]
*  didn't wanna land and be a distraction. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1373.72s)]
*  Well, this is Kamala's Katrina. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1375.96s)]
*  She and Biden are failing the people of the Southeast. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1377.48s)]
*  She prioritized the illegal immigrants over you, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1380.6000000000001s)]
*  the American people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1383.44s)]
*  She talks a big game about equity, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  but doesn't seem to give a damn [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1386.56s)]
*  when people are truly in need. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1388.4s)]
*  And today, former President Trump said [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1390.3200000000002s)]
*  that this has been the worst hurricane response [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1392.1200000000001s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1394.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1395.56s)]
*  Now we have a horrific disaster in North Carolina, Georgia, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1396.84s)]
*  South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida and Virginia. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1400.32s)]
*  That's how big this hurricane was. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1404.72s)]
*  And the Harris Biden administration says [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1406.8s)]
*  they don't have any money. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1409.72s)]
*  They've spent it all on, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1411.12s)]
*  they spent all of their money. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1413.52s)]
*  They have almost no money [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1414.6s)]
*  because they spent it all on illegal migrants. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1416.4399999999998s)]
*  This is the worst response in the history of hurricanes. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1418.8s)]
*  The president's right. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1424.72s)]
*  And sadly, tonight as we speak, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1425.76s)]
*  Americans from North Carolina all the way down to Florida [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1427.32s)]
*  in the Southeast continue to suffer. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VkbSQ1rnJs&t=1430.68s)]
